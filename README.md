# 📘 MLE_HW_KevinLi

Hi, I'm Kevin!  
Welcome to my journey through the **Machine Learning Engineering in GenAI** course. I'm a beginner in Python and have some basic HTML/CSS knowledge - afterall, I come from a graphic design background. This repo is where I’ll document my weekly homework, projects, and notes as I learn and grow through this 10-week program.

## 🧠 Repo Overview

This repo contains my homework and notes for each week of the MLE course. Each week is organized with space for notes, learnings, and code snippets. I’ll update this regularly as I complete each assignment.

## 🗓️ Weekly Breakdown

### Week 1: 🧱 Introduction t o Large Language Models (LLMs) and Prompt Engineering
- 📝 **Project 1.3:** Testing Puppeteer in Claude
  - 📌 *Note:* Puppeteer only takes screenshots within its environment inside Claude.
- 📝 **Project 3.1:** Prompt Engineering with Langchain
  - 📌 *Note:* It is difficult to prompt engineer the model to only provide 1 word/ city name answers without additional text. This may be a model issue.
