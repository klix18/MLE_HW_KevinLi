# 📘 MLE_HW_KevinLi

Hi, I'm Kevin!  
Welcome to my journey through the **Machine Learning Engineer** course. I'm a beginner in Python and have some basic HTML/CSS knowledge. This repo is where I’ll document my weekly homework, projects, and notes as I learn and grow through this 10-week program.

## 🧠 Course Overview

This repo contains my homework and notes for each week of the MLE course. Each week is organized with space for notes, learnings, and code snippets. I’ll update this regularly as I complete each assignment.
