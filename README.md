Hi I'm Kevin. I know minimum python and simple HTML CSS.
This is my first time exploring github.
Hope I make some cool projects and share them here.


Week 1 project 1.3 puppeteer can only take screenshots within it's environment inside claude. the actual screenshot is also not a jpg and not named example, rather a webp.
