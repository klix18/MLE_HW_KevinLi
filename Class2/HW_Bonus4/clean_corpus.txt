However, the grow- ing complexity and volume of legal documents challenge traditional retrieval methods. Trac- eRetriever mirrors real-world legal search by operating with limited case information, ex- tracting only rhetorically significant segments instead of requiring complete documents. Our pipeline integrates BM25, Vector Database, and Cross-Encoder models, combining initial re- sults through Reciprocal Rank Fusion before final re-ranking. Rhetorical annotations are gen- erated using a Hierarchical BiLSTM CRF clas- sifier trained on Indian judgments. Evaluated on IL-PCR and COLIEE 2025 datasets, Trac- eRetriever addresses growing document vol- ume challenges while aligning with practical search constraints, reliable and scalable foun- dation for precedent retrieval enhancing legal research when only partial case knowledge is available. 1 Introduction The common law system’s foundation rests upon the principle of stare decisis, mandating judicial adherence to precedents established in prior rul- ings when addressing analogous issues and facts within the same jurisdiction. As legal documenta- tion grows in complexity and volume, sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques be- come indispensable for understanding, analyzing, and retrieving relevant precedents. TraceRetriever plays a crucial role in upholding stare decisis, facili- tating the identification of past judgments with sim- ilar legal contexts to ensure consistent application of the law. The sheer volume of legal resources, in- cluding judgments, statutes, and regulations, poses a significant challenge for legal professionals seek- ing pertinent precedents, underscoring the urgent need for effective retrieval mechanisms. A notable limitation in much of the existing work on automated precedent retrieval is its re- liance on using entire prior case documents as queries. This approach deviates significantly from real-world legal practice, where lawyers typically formulate search queries based on specific factual details and legal issues extracted from the case at hand, often with limited initial information. To address this gap, this paper tackles the challenge of mimicking real-world legal search scenarios in TraceRetriever by proposing a novel heuristic ap- proach. Our methodology strategically integrates the complementary strengths of a keyword-based model (BM25), a semantic Vector Database, and a fine-grained Cross-Encoder for re-ranking. A key innovation of our work lies in utilizing a trained Hierarchical Bidirectional LSTM (HierBiLSTM) model by (Bhattacharya et al., 2019) to classify sen- tences within legal documents into distinct rhetor- ical roles. We then leverage the role segments, identified through this classification, as the query for our retrieval pipeline. This deliberate use of limited, rhetorically-informed query components directly mirrors the information scarcity often en- countered in practical legal research. The core problem this paper addresses is therefore the devel- opment of a TraceRetriever system that effectively operates with limited, contextually relevant infor- mation, thereby more accurately reflecting real- world legal search processes. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed TraceRetriever pipeline, we conducted experiments on two established legal datasets: the Indian Le- gal Text Understanding and Reasoning (IL-PCR) dataset (Joshi et al., 2023) and the Competition on Legal Information Extraction and Entailment (COLIEE) 2025 dataset. Our pipeline employs a heuristic approach that strategically integrates the strengths of three distinct retrieval models: a se- mantic Vector Database, the BM25 algorithm, and a more nuanced Cross-Encoder.

The left side shows the original excerpt, while the right side displays the labeled segments. In our approach, only relevant segments such as Facts and Issue are retained to emulate real-world legal case retrieval scenarios, where complete information like Reasoning or Decision may not be available at query time (Nigam et al., 2025). the initial retrieval results from the Vector Database and BM25, we implemented Reciprocal Rank Fu- sion (RRP), a robust re-ranking technique. In our TraceRetriever pipeline, we established BM25 as a robust baseline, representing a tradi- tional keyword-based approach to information re- trieval. To enhance the relevance and accuracy of our results, we implemented a sophisticated re- ranking strategy that leverages both semantic un- derstanding and fine-grained interaction. Specifi- cally, we employed Cross-Encoders to re-rank the top-k documents initially retrieved by two distinct methods: the lexical matching of BM25 and the se- mantic similarity captured by our Vector Database (a bi-encoder-based approach). This multi-faceted strategy effectively integrates the strengths of three complementary retrieval paradigms: Our key contributions are: 1. A realistic legal retrieval strategy using rhetor- ical role-based queries reflecting limited- information scenarios. 2. Development of TraceRetriever: A hybrid pipeline integrating BM25, vector search, and cross-encoder re-ranking. For the sake of reproducibility, we have made our dataset, code, and RAG-based pipeline imple- mentation via an github repository!. 2 Related Work Legal case retrieval has witnessed a rapid transfor- mation with the advent of LLMs, RAG pipelines, ‘https ://github.com/ShubhamKumarNigam/Legal_IR and rhetorical role labeling. Traditionally, legal in- formation retrieval relied heavily on lexical match- ing (e.g., BM25), which struggled to handle the semantic and structural nuances of legal texts. Re- cent innovations focus on improving retrieval ac- curacy by leveraging domain-specific embeddings, legal document structures, and rhetorical role un- derstanding. Several systems have explored enhancing le- gal QA and retrieval using hybrid architectures. (Wiratunga et al., 2024) integrates Case-Based Rea- soning with RAG to improve contextual relevance and factual correctness in legal question-answering. Similarly, (Panchal et al., 2025) utilizes FAISS and DeepSeek embeddings to make Indian legal knowl- edge accessible through a chatbot interface. Another significant trend is the use of rhetorical roles in structuring legal texts. (Bhattacharya et al., 2019; Malik et al., 2022) pioneered rhetorical role classification in Indian legal judgments, showing that deep neural architectures such as BiLSTM- CRF and multi-task learning can outperform tradi- tional methods. (Marino et al., 2023) further ad- vanced this by stacking transformers over LEGAL- BERT to capture inter-sentence dependencies for rhetorical role classification across multilingual legal datasets. These works collectively demon- strate the feasibility and utility of segmenting legal documents into roles such as Facts, Issues, and Reasoning categories that are highly valuable for information extraction and retrieval. In recent stud- ies, (Bhattacharya et al., 2019) proposed a CRF- BiLSTM model specifically for as signing rhetori- cal roles to sentences in Indian legal documents. In the context of document-to-document legal retrieval, methods like (Althammer et al., 2022), (Ma et al., 2023), and (Li et al., 2023) aim to overcome the challenges of long input lengths and weak semantic relevance by employing paragraph aggregation, structure-aware pretraining, and cus- tom contrastive loss functions. Meanwhile, (Tang et al., 2023) and (Tang et al., 2024) take a graph based approach, modeling the connectivity be- tween cases via attributed case graphs or global semantic networks to achieve state-of-the-art per- formance. (Nigam et al., 2022) presents a cascaded retrieval framework that integrates BM25 for lex- ical matching with Sentence BERT and Sent2Vec for semantic understanding. Interestingly, results show that BM25 alone often outperforms neural models, reaffirming the robustness and relevance of lexical approaches in legal case retrieval. Beyond traditional lexical and semantic meth- ods, several recent studies have explored innova- tive architectures to enhance legal case retrieval by addressing challenges such as long document length, complex legal semantics, and noisy or sparse queries. (Hu et al., 2022) proposes a re- trieval method grounded in legal facts by combin- ing topic modeling with BERT-based paragraph aggregation, offering more accurate semantic rep- resentations tailored to the legal domain. Similarly, (Shao et al., 2020) focuses on paragraph-level in- teractions, modeling fine-grained relationships be- tween query and candidate cases to improve rele- vance estimation using a cascade framework and BERT finetuned on legal entailment tasks. Address- ing structural and causal reasoning, (Zhang et al., 2023) introduces a counterfactual graph learning approach, which transforms legal cases into graphs of legal elements and enhances retrieval via coun- terfactual data augmentation and relational graph neural networks. Meanwhile, (Zhou et al., 2023) employ large language models (LLMs) to distill salient query content, showing that query reformu- lation using LLMs improves retrieval even in long, noisy legal queries. Structural reasoning is also em- phasized in SLR (Zhou et al., 2023), which incor- porates both internal (document segmentation into roles like Facts, Holding, Decision) and external (charge relationship graphs) structures to enhance retrieval accuracy via a learning-to-rank approach, (Santosh et al., 2025) enhances prior case retrieval by generating legal concepts from the factual sec- tion of a query case to capture semantic intent. Col- lectively, these works highlight a growing trend toward structurally aware, semantically enriched, and role-sensitive retrieval models supporting the need for rhetorical role-driven query formulations in real-world legal search settings. While these systems improve retrieval through structure, semantics, or scale, few explicitly ad- dress the limited-information retrieval scenario commonly encountered in real-world legal prac- tice, where queries often arise from partial know1- edge, such as only the Facts or Issues of a case. The (Deng et al., 2024) framework approaches this partially by reformulating legal documents into in- terpretable sub-facts using LLMs, but it does not explicitly tie these sub-facts to rhetorical roles. In contrast to general-purpose document re- trieval, (Joshi et al., 2023) propose U-CREAT, an unsupervised retrieval framework that extracts and matches event tuples consisting of predicates and their arguments from entire legal documents. How- ever, U-CREAT still requires parsing the full doc- ument to extract events and does not leverage ex- plicit legal segmentation such as rhetorical roles. 3. Task Description The goal of this task is to develop models capable of retrieving the most relevant prior legal cases for a given query case, with a novel emphasis on mim- icking realistic legal reasoning workflows. Unlike previous work that provides entire case documents as input queries to retrieval models, we constrain the query representation by leveraging rhetorical role segmentation. This segmentation reflects how legal professionals typically reason over and search with focused portions of a case, such as facts, is- sues, or arguments, rather than the full text. Let Q = {1 @2,---,Qp} bea set of query legal cases, where each q; is a segmented case document composed of rhetorical roles: qi = {Facts;, Issues;, Arguments,,... } Rather than passing the full g; as a monolithic document, we present the segmented roles (individ- ually or in combination) to retrieval models to en- able fine-grained relevance modeling. This design encourages the system to focus on legally salient information while ignoring irrelevant or verbose content, thus improving efficiency and interpretabil- ity. Let D = {d,, d2,...,d,,} be a corpus of prece- dent legal documents. The objective is to re- trieve a ranked list of k relevant documents R; = {ri1,i2,---,Tik} CG D for each query q;, where documents are ranked by their relevance. We define a retrieval scoring function: g:QxD-R where g(q;,d;) outputs a relevance score indi- cating the degree to which the prior legal document d; is relevant to the query q;. The retrieved list R; for a query q; is then constructed by selecting the top & documents from D based on their relevance scores: R; = top-k{dj € D | g(aid;) is high} The input to the system is a legal query q;, and the output is a ranked list of & prior legal documents R;, ordered by their relevance to the query. 4 Dataset To support research in the domain of Prior Case Re- trieval (PCR), we utilize the IL-PCR (Indian Legal Prior Case Retrieval) corpus, a large-scale collec- tion of Indian legal documents comprising 7,070 English-language case texts by (Joshi et al., 2023). This corpus enables the development and bench- marking of retrieval systems specifically tailored to the Indian legal system. Dataset COLIEE’25 IL-PCR # Documents [PHONE] Avg.

The initial set comprises the 100 most-cited Supreme Court of India (SCI) https ://indiankanoon.org/ judgments, referred to as the zero-hop set. To in- crease citation density, cases cited within these judgments (the one-hop set) were also collected. This hierarchical collection approach ensures that each document has multiple cited cases, allowing for robust retrieval evaluation (Joshi et al., 2023). Following standard preprocessing, empty or invalid cases were discarded. The resulting corpus was par- titioned into training (70%), validation (10%), and test (20%) splits. 4.2 Preprocessing The preprocessing pipeline includes named entity normalization using spaCy’s NER model, along- side a manually curated gazetteer. This standard- ization improves the generalizability of learned representations. Hyperlinked citations in the doc- uments were replaced with a standardized token , while references to statutes and laws were retained, aligning with the task focus on case retrieval rather than statute retrieval. Addition- ally, an alternate version of the dataset removes entire sentences containing citations, as discussed in (Joshi et al., 2023). 5 Methodology This section elucidates the TraceRetriever method- ology, a multi-stage framework designed for effec- tive prior case retrieval, particularly when initiated with partial case details. Our approach integrates advanced NLP techniques, starting with rhetorical role annotation to enable targeted querying of key document sections. We then employ a hybrid re- trieval strategy, combining semantic vector search with lexical BM25 matching on a focused candi- date set. The resulting ranked lists are fused using RRF, followed by a deep semantic re-ranking via a cross-encoder. 5.1. Rhetorical Role Annotation of Legal Documents The initial stage of our methodology involves en- riching legal documents with rhetorical role annota- tions at the sentence level. To achieve this, we first perform sentence segmentation using the spaCy library. We implement the BiLSTM-CREF archi- tecture introduced by (Bhattacharya et al., 2019), which integrates a BiLSTM network with a Con- ditional Random Field (CRF) layer. The model takes as input sentence embeddings generated us- ing a sent2vec model trained specifically on Indian Supreme Court judgments. These embeddings are processed by the BiLSTM to capture the sequen- tial context across sentences. The CRF layer then models the dependencies between adjacent labels, enabling the output to follow the inherent structural patterns present in legal documents. By leverag- ing contextual cues from surrounding sentences, the model assigns a rhetorical role label to each sentence in a coherent and structured manner. The output of this stage is a corpus of legal documents where each sentence is associated with a predicted rhetorical role, forming the foundation for subse- quent information retrieval experiments. 5.2 Vector Database Construction and Candidate Retrieval To enable efficient semantic retrieval of legal doc- uments, we employed Milvus to store and query dense vector representations. Each entry in the col- lection comprised a unique id, a 768-dimensional embedding generated using the Snowflake Arctic Embed v2.0 model, and the original document text (limited to 60,000 characters). An IVF-FLAT in- dex, configured with nlist = 2048 and using L2 distance, was built to facilitate rapid approximate nearest neighbor search. Query vectors, embedded using the same model, were matched against the collection, with the nprobe parameter controlling the search depth across partitions. The top-k se- mantically similar documents were retrieved based on L2 distance, forming the candidate set for down- stream re-ranking via cross-encoders. This stage ensures that initial retrieval captures documents with high semantic alignment to the input query. 5.3. BM25 Retrieval on Vector Database Candidates To complement semantic similarity with lexical matching, BM25 is applied but only to a reduced candidate set to avoid high computational costs. These candidates are pre-selected using vector- based retrieval, ensuring that BM25 is run only on semantically relevant documents, balancing effi- ciency and retrieval accuracy. The process begins by selecting the top-& candidates from the vector search. The parameter k controls the trade-off be- tween recall and efficiency larger may improve recall but increases computational load. We se- lected k as 1000 to maintain this balance. BM25 then scores each candidate based on term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF), rank- ing documents where rare, frequent query terms ap- pear. This yields a refined list of documents ranked by lexical relevance. By applying BM25 only to vector-selected candidates, the system enhances semantic matching with precise lexical signals. 5.4 Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) To combine the ranked outputs from vector-based and BM25 retrieval, we employ Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), a rank aggregation technique that leverages the complementary strengths of different retrieval methods for improved performance. Each document in the ranked lists receives a numerical rank (1 for top, 2 for second, etc.). Its reciprocal rank is computed as aETR where k is a constant used to reduce the influence of lower-ranked re- sults. We selected an optimal k to balance influence across both retrieval methods. For each document, its reciprocal ranks across all lists are summed to generate an aggregated RRF score. Documents are then sorted in descending order of this score, producing a fused ranking that integrates both se- mantic similarity (from the vector DB) and lexical relevance (from BM25). RRF enhances retrieval by combining diverse signals, resulting in a more robust and accurate final document ranking than either method alone. 5.5 Cross-Encoder Re-ranking To refine the ranking of candidate documents and prioritize the most relevant prior cases, we use a cross-encoder model. Unlike bi-encoders used in the initial retrieval, cross-encoders attend to both the query and document simultaneously. The pro- cess begins by forming (query, document) pairs from the top results obtained via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). This narrows the focus to promis- ing candidates. Each pair is scored using the pre- trained bge-reranker-v2-m3 model, which excels at capturing fine-grained semantic interactions. For long documents exceeding the model’s input lim- its, a chunking strategy is applied. Each chunk is scored individually, and a final relevance score is computed using a weighted average of chunk scores. Other aggregation strategies like max or mean can also be used. Finally, documents are re- ranked based on these cross-encoder scores. This yields a final ranked list where the most seman- tically relevant cases are prioritized, enhancing retrieval quality by leveraging the model’s deep understanding of query-document relations.

It begins by segment- ing the query legal document into sentences and classifying each into rhetorical roles (e.g., Facts, Issue, Argument, Reasoning, and Decision) using a pre-trained Hierarchical BiLSTM. This segmen- tation supports role-specific querying, reflecting real-world scenarios where legal practitioners of- ten search based on partial case descriptions. To retrieve initial candidates efficiently, a bi-encoder is used to encode both the rhetorically-filtered query and documents into dense embeddings. A vector database is then queried to retrieve the top-k seman- tically relevant documents. Since applying BM25 across the entire corpus is computationally expen- Sive, it is selectively applied only to this subset of vector-retrieved documents to capture lexical overlap. To unify the strengths of semantic and lexical signals, the results from the vector search and BM25 are merged using Reciprocal Rank Fu- sion (RRF), which produces a single ranked list. Fi- nally, a cross-encoder re-ranks this list by jointly en- coding each query-document pair to compute fine- grained relevance scores. Through this multi-stage approach, TraceRetriever effectively combines se- mantic understanding, lexical precision, and deep relevance modeling addressing the challenges of prior case retrieval under limited-information con- ditions. 6 Evaluation Metrics To evaluate the effectiveness of our information re- trieval models, we employ a standard set of metrics commonly used in retrieval tasks. Our primary evaluation relies on Precision@k, Recall@k, Mean Average Precision (MAP), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and F1 @k. Precision @k quantifies the fraction of relevant documents within the top-k retrieved results, whereas Recall@k as- sesses the system’s capability to identify all rele- vant documents within the top-k. MAP offers an overall performance measure by averaging the pre- cision at each rank where a relevant document is found, across all queries. MRR focuses on the rank of the first relevant document in the result list. Fi- nally, Fl @k calculates the harmonic mean of Preci- sion@k and Recall @k, providing a balanced evalu- ation of both aspects. Collectively, these metrics of- fer a thorough evaluation framework for assessing the ranking effectiveness and retrieval performance of the models. Here, we introduce the results of our experiments and discuss the performance of various models. Table 2 provides a summary of evaluation metrics for every model. 7 Results Analysis Our experimental evaluation demonstrates signifi- cant variations in retrieval performance across dif- ferent query formulations based on rhetorical roles and retrieval methodologies. Table 2 presents a comprehensive comparison of precision, recall, F1- score, Mean Average Precision (MAP), and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) across all experimental configurations. 7.1 Retrieval Method Performance The empirical results reveal distinct performance characteristics among the three retrieval meth- ods. BM25, a traditional lexical matching ap- proach, consistently underperforms compared to the semantic-based methods across all query con- figurations.

Vector DB demonstrates su- perior performance in precision-oriented metrics, achieving the highest MAP (0.3783) and MRR (0.3924) scores with the Facts+Issue+Reasoning configuration. Notably, Vector DB consistently requires lower optimal & values (typically 5-7), indicating its strong ability to position relevant documents at higher ranks. This characteristic makes Vector DB particularly suitable for appli- cations where precision at lower ranks is priori- tized. The Cross-encoder model exhibits different performance characteristics, consistently achieving higher recall values but requiring larger k values (7-11) to reach optimal performance. For instance, with the Facts+Issue+Reasoning configuration, the Cross-encoder achieves the highest recall (0.2815) among all methods but at k = 11. This suggests that Cross-encoder captures a broader range of rel- evant documents but with less precise ranking ca- pability compared to Vector DB. 7.2 Impact of Rhetorical Role Configurations The experimental results demonstrate that query formulation using specific rhetorical roles signifi- cantly impacts retrieval effectiveness. Several key observations emerge: Using only factual components (Facts) yields the lowest performance across all retrieval meth- ods, with Vector DB achieving MAP of 0.2566 and MRR of 0.2783. This finding suggests that factual information alone provides insufficient con- text for effective legal case retrieval. The addition of issue information (Facts+Issue) produces mod- est improvements across all models, with Vector DB showing MAP of 0.2880 and MRR of 0.3055. This improvement indicates that legal issues pro- vide important discriminative information beyond mere facts. When argumentative elements are in- corporated (Facts+Issue+Arguments), we observe substantial performance gains, particularly for Vec- tor DB (MAP: 0.3291, MRR: 0.3431) and Cross- encoder (Recall@k: 0.2295). This suggests that arguments contain substantive information about legal reasoning that aids in identifying relevant precedents. The Facts+Issue+Reasoning config- uration consistently yields the best performance across all retrieval methods, with Vector DB achiev- ing the highest overall MAP (0.3783) and MRR (0.3924). This finding highlights the critical im- portance of legal reasoning components in deter- mining case relevance. It suggests that the explicit reasoning articulated by judges forms the most dis- criminative aspect of legal documents for retrieval purposes. Interestingly, incorporating the deci- sion component (Facts+Issue+Decision) results in performance degradation compared to the rea- soning configuration. Vector DB’s MAP decreases to 0.2931 and MRR to 0.3157, while Cross-encoder shows similar declines. This degradation may be at- tributed to the fact that decisions often contain stan- dardized language that is less discriminative than the specific reasoning that led to those decisions. The full query configuration performs relatively well (Vector DB: MAP 0.3484, MRR 0.3585), but still falls short of the Facts+Issue+Reasoning con- figuration. This indicates that using the entire doc- ument introduces noise that dilutes retrieval effec- tiveness. 7.3 Dataset Comparison A comparison between the IL-PCR and COLIEE datasets reveals substantial performance disparities. All retrieval methods perform markedly better on the IL-PCR dataset. On the COLIEE dataset, the best performance is achieved by Vector DB with MAP of 0.1695 and MRR of 0.1786, substantially lower than the corresponding metrics on IL-PCR. This disparity may be attributed to differences in document structure, domain-specific language, or the inherent complexity of the legal relationships represented in the COLIEE dataset. Additionally, our BiLSTM-based rhetorical role segmentation model was trained specifically on Indian legal doc- uments. 7.4 Optimal k Values In the context of information retrieval, & represents the number of top-ranked documents retrieved by a system. An interesting observation from our experiments is the variation in optimal / values across different configurations. Vector DB gener- ally achieves optimal performance at lower k val- ues (5—7), while Cross-encoder typically requires higher k values (7-11) to reach optimal perfor- mance. This pattern is consistent across query configurations and further emphasizes the distinct characteristics of these retrieval approaches: Vec- tor DB excels at precise ranking of highly relevant documents within a smaller top-& set, while Cross- encoder captures a broader range of potentially relevant documents, often requiring a larger top-k to include the most pertinent results due to less precise initial ranking. 7.5 Error Analysis Retrieval errors were common when queries lacked argumentative depth or rhetorical coherence. Par- tial segments like Facts or Facts+Issue often led to vague queries, reducing the ability to retrieve precise legal precedents. Cross-encoders achieved high recall but lower MAP in such settings. For example, in the Facts-only configuration (Table 2), recall was 0.205, but MAP dropped to 0.2364, indi- cating difficulty in ranking the most legally relevant documents. BM25 struggled with rhetorical overlap, particu- larly in IL-PCR, where Facts-only and Facts+Issue yielded low MAPs of 0.1599 and 0.1907. Its reliance on surface-level term frequency lim- ited its ability to distinguish semantically sim- ilar yet legally distinct content. Interestingly, dense retrieval with Vector DB performed bet- ter in focused configurations. In IL-PCR, the MAP improved from 0.3484 (Full) to 0.3783 (Facts+Issue+Reasoning), likely due to reduced procedural noise and improved signal-to-noise ratio in embeddings. This suggests that full-document queries, though comprehensive, may dilute dense models with irrelevant content. In contrast, se- lected rhetorical segments enhance semantic rich- ness and focus. Cross-encoders performed best when queries included Arguments or Reasoning, but struggled without structured argumentative flow. Overall, Vector DB benefited most from rhetorically rich inputs, with combinations like Facts+Issue+Reasoning offering the best trade-off between semantic depth and legal specificity. In COLIEE, absence of rhetorical segmentation degraded performance across models. Vector DB’s MAP dropped to 0.1695, and BM25 to 0.141, as noisy, unsegmented queries confused both dense and sparse retrievers. The rhetorical classifier, trained on Indian cases, also failed to generalize to Canadian judgments in COLIEE, reducing the effectiveness of rhetorical-aware retrieval. 8 Conclusions and Future Work This work introduced a novel approach to prior case retrieval that better reflects real-world legal research, where professionals often rely on partial case information like Facts and Issue. By using rhetorical role segmentation to extract these com- ponents as queries, our method simulates realistic legal workflows. Evaluations on ILTUR and COL- IEE datasets showed that even under these con- straints, our pipeline BM25, VectorDB, RRF, and cross-encoder reranking retrieves relevant cases, though with reduced precision and recall compared to full-document queries. Nonetheless, this role- based querying aligns closely with how legal pro- fessionals conduct research, offering a practical shift in retrieval methodology. Our main contribu- tion is a conceptual framework for retrieval under partial information, encouraging a more practice- oriented direction in legal IR. Rather than chasing ideal scores, we aim to model realistic scenarios that support practical system design. This work has laid the groundwork for a more realistic paradigm in prior case retrieval by focusing on the informa- tion actually available at the initial stages of legal research. Our findings underscore the viability of a pipeline leveraging rhetorical role segmentation for query formulation, demonstrating effective, albeit reduced, retrieval performance compared to meth- ods relying on complete case documents. Future work includes improving retrieval robustness under sparse queries, enhancing rhetorical segmentation, and testing advanced rerankers. We also aim to explore cross-lingual and multi-domain retrieval to further bridge academic research and real-world legal use cases. Limitations While this work presents a novel approach to prior case retrieval that mirrors real-world legal research, several limitations remain and highlight directions for improvement. A key challenge is the semantic sparsity of queries constructed from only rhetorical roles like Facts and Issue. This constrained input can omit important context, limiting the models’ ability to fully capture legal reasoning and reduc- ing retrieval precision. Rhetorical overlap between roles such as Facts and Reasoning poses another issue. Their linguistic similarity makes it difficult especially for models like BM25 to differentiate cases based solely on rhetorical cues. While cross- encoders and vector models mitigate this to some extent, they still struggle with nuanced legal dis- tinctions. Class imbalance in rhetorical roles also affects performance, particularly for underrepre- sented roles like Issue or Decision. Additionally, the computational complexity of advanced mod- els like cross-encoders and dense retrievers can hinder scalability. Their high resource demands may limit deployment in real-world systems. Fu- ture work should explore optimization techniques such as pruning or quantization to maintain perfor- mance with lower resource requirements. While the system shows promise under real-world con- straints, addressing these limitations will be crucial for building scalable and robust legal retrieval sys- tems.

arXiv:2508.00766v1 [cs.CV] 1 Aug 2025 Sample-Aware Test-Time Adaptation for Medical Image-to-Image ‘Translation Irene Iele!*, Francesco Di Feola!*, Valerio Guarrasi®, Paolo Soda?” ? ? ? *Unit of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Systems, Department of Engineering, Universita Campus Bio-Medico di Roma, Via Alvaro del Portillo, 21, Rome, 00128, Italy ’Department of Diagnostics and Intervention, Radiation Physics, Biomedical Engineering, Umea University, Umeda, 901 87, Sweden Abstract Image-to-image translation has emerged as a powerful technique in medical imaging, enabling tasks such as image denoising and cross-modality con- version. However, it suffers from limitations in handling out-of-distribution samples without causing performance degradation. To address this limi- tation, we propose a novel Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) framework that dynamically adjusts the translation process based on the characteristics of each test sample. Our method introduces a Reconstruction Module to quantify the domain shift and a Dynamic Adaptation Block that selectively modifies the internal features of a pretrained translation model to mitigate the shift without compromising the performance on in-distribution samples that do not require adaptation. We evaluate our approach on two med- ical image-to-image translation tasks: low-dose CT denoising and 7 to T> MRI translation, showing consistent improvements over both the base- line translation model without TTA and prior TTA methods. Our analysis highlights the limitations of the state-of-the-art that uniformly apply the adaptation to both out-of-distribution and in-distribution samples, demon- strating that dynamic, sample-specific adjustment offers a promising path to improve model resilience in real-world scenarios.

Preprint submitted to Medical Image Analysis August 4, 2025 Keywords: Test Time Adaptation, Medical Image Translation, Domain Shift, Medical Imaging 1. Introduction Image-to-image translation converts an image from a source domain X to a target domain Y [1], and has found numerous applications across di- verse fields, particularly in medical imaging [2], supporting different imaging modalities and key tasks such as noise reduction, image synthesis and super- resolution. In clinical settings, image-to-image translation may offer signifi- cant time and cost benefits, as it can reduce the need for repeated imaging exams on the same patient while minimizing exposure to high-dose radiation. As a data-driven method, image-to-image translation is sensitive to distri- bution shift, which arises when the training and testing distributions differ due to variations in imaging systems, acquisition protocols, or anatomical structures [3]. Such shifts lead to out-of-distribution (OOD) data, samples that deviate from the training distribution, ultimately degrading model per- formance, limiting generalization, and reducing the quality of translated im- ages. To address this challenge, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a strategy to adapt pretrained models to unseen data during inference without requiring retraining or access to large datasets, improving robust- ness in real-world scenarios, where institutions often lack the computational resources or data volume required to train models from scratch. For instance, TTA methods modify the input data, adjust intermediate feature represen- tations, or update the model’s weights at inference time [4]. Despite recent advancements in this field, most existing methods apply adaptation strategies to all samples during inference [5], whether they are OOD or in-distribution (ID) samples, that is data drawn from the same distribution as the training set. However, this is a main limitation because TTA is currently designed to improve performance on OOD samples: when applied to ID data, it may dis- rupt the model’s optimal configuration and compromise its generalization |6]. Therefore, striking the right balance between adapting to new data and pre- serving the original knowledge of the model is crucial to achieve consistent and reliable performance across diverse data distributions. Moreover, while most studies have focused on TTA for predictive tasks [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], its application in the generative domain remains largely unexplored. On these grounds, we hereby propose a sample-aware TTA method for medical image-to-image translation that dynamically adapts a pretrained translation model to OOD data while preserving its performance on ID data. To this end, we introduce a trainable reconstruction module that quantifies the degree of domain shift for each test input, and based on the estimated shift, an adaptation module applies feature-level transformations at multiple stages of the translation model, adjusting to the specific characteristics of each test sample. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on two distinct tasks: Low Dose CT denoising (LDCT) and T; to T2 MRI translation. Hence, our contributions can be summarized as follows: e We propose a sample-aware TTA method that adapts a pre-trained image-to-image translation model to OOD samples, effectively narrow- ing the performance gap between ID and OOD samples while preserving ID performance. e We design our TTA approach to be dynamic, i.e., to be able to tailor the adaptation process to each OOD test sample and a strategy that allows maximizing performance across varying degrees of distribution shift. e We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on two distinct medical image-to-image trans- lation tasks, highlighting the task-agnostic nature of our method. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 reviews related works on TTA, section 3 presents the methods, section 4 describes the experimental configuration, section 5 presents and discusses the results, whereas section 6 offers concluding remarks. 2. Related Works TTA has emerged as a promising strategy to improve model robustness under distribution shifts [4]. Early efforts in this direction date back to 2011, when Jain and Learned-Miller [14] investigated the use of Gaussian process regression to adapt a cascade of classifiers at inference time. Since then, a variety of strategies have been proposed to adapt deep neural networks without requiring access to the training data or full model retraining [4, 15]. TTA is particularly relevant in medical imaging, where shifts frequently stem from differences in acquisition protocols, patient populations, and imag- ing devices. Despite that, recent studies have primarily focused on using TTA to mitigate performance degradation in predictive tasks such as medical im- age classification [7, 8], and segmentation [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. For example, Ma et al. [7] proposed a TTA strategy to address label distribution shifts by training multiple classifiers, each specialized for a class-dominated distribu- tion. At test time, the outputs of these classifiers are dynamically combined and adapted to the test label distribution, using a consistency regularization loss to guide and calibrate their relative contributions. Yang et al. [8] in- troduced a method that dynamically adjusts the learning rate for each test sample based on the estimated distribution shift, enabling stable adaptation across both medical image classification and segmentation tasks. In the context of medical semantic segmentation, Karani et al. [9] pro- posed input level adaptation by dynamically optimizing a shallow normal- ization network during inference. This network projects each test sample into a normalized space, guided by a denoising autoencoder prior trained to identify and correct implausible segmentations. Building on this approach, Valvano et al. [11] replaced the autoencoder prior with a discriminator net- work, trained to identify and provide corrective feedback to the normalization network at test time. However, input-level adaptation alone may be insuf- ficient to fully address complex domain shifts, as it cannot adapt deeper, task-relevant features. To overcome this limitation, Li et al. [10] extended TTA to both the input and feature levels, using a translation network and a multi-task segmentation network guided by an autoencoder-based recon- struction loss. Another line of research focuses on test-time training using self-supervision [16]. Instead of adapting intermediate features directly, the model weights are updated during inference guided by pre-text tasks such as image inpainting [17] or rotation prediction [18]. Building on this idea, Wen et al. [12] proposed an approach for CT image segmentation that employs a Y-shaped architecture based on a U-Net backbone. The model includes a self-supervised denoising decoder that shares skip connections with the main segmentation branch. It is jointly trained on segmentation and denoising tasks, while at inference time, only the encoder’s batch normalization layers are adapted using the denoising loss. Similarly, Hu et al. [13] proposed a TTA method that updates only batch normalization parameters during in- ference, guided by two loss terms: one that promotes confident and diverse predictions across local image regions, and a contour regularization loss that encourages smooth boundaries to enhance spatial consistency in the seg- mentation outputs. While TTA has been extensively studied for predictive tasks, its application to medical image-to-image translation has, to the best 4 of our knowledge, been explored only in [19]. In this work, similarly to [9], He et al. [19] proposed a self-supervised TTA approach for T, to T, MRI translation that performs feature-level adaptation by using shallow adaptor networks, guided by an autoencoder-based reconstruction loss designed to capture domain shift. However, the adaptation is applied uniformly across all test samples, without distinguishing between ID and OOD cases, which is a key limitation of the current literature. Furthermore, the method employs a fixed set of adaptors placed at both image and feature levels, inserted at predetermined locations within the task model, without accounting for the specific characteristics of each test sample, that can result in unnecessary transformations or suboptimal adaptation outcomes. The review of the works presented in this section highlights the growing interest in TTA across various predictive domains. However, these methods have seen limited application in generative tasks, revealing a critical gap in the literature. Moreover, the lack of selective, sample-specific TTA strategies for image-to-image translation underscores the need for approaches that ac- tivate adaptation only when necessary, preserving high fidelity and ensuring generalization across diverse medical imaging scenarios. 3. Methods Let x € R”*" be a source image and y € R”*” its corresponding target image, where w and h denote its image width and height, respectively. Image- to-image translation can be formulated as: y=T(a) ry (1) where 7 is a generic task model trained to map the source image « to its target counterpart y ~ y. At inference, we apply TTA to refine the task model’s performance on potentially OOD samples. The goal is to reduce translation error by adapting the model to the individual test sample, such that: Ig yl <|y-yl (2) where y® denotes the synthesized output after applying TTA, and | - | is a generic error metric (e.g., @; or @2 norm).

Our TTA framework for medical image-to-image translation is illustrated in Figure 3. Panel (a) shows that our approach comprises four main compo- nents: the first is the pretrained task model 7, which remains frozen during adaptation. The second is the TTA trigger, which selectively activates adap- tation for OOD samples. The third is the Reconstruction Module (RM), shown in panel (b), which estimates domain shift at multiple feature levels and guides the adaptation process. The fourth component is the Dynamic Adaptation Block (DAB), which transforms input features based on the shift estimated by the RM (panel (c)). The key idea of our approach is to adapt only when necessary and in a sample-specific manner. On the one hand, we retain the fixed parameters of 7 for ID samples, avoiding unnecessary adaptation. On the other hand, we enable feature-level adaptation for OOD samples by dynamically selecting the most effective subset of feature adap- tors. To this end, we follow a multi-step training process. First, we train the task model 7; then, we freeze 7 and train the RM on the same training set to learn feature distributions and quantify reconstruction errors at different lev- els of 7, serving as a proxy for domain shift during TTA. Following Figure 3 (a), the test image a is first passed to the frozen task model 7, produc- ing the output image y. We then use the reconstructor R, to compute the discrepancy between the task model’s output and its reconstruction: &y=||9— Gl], where Y, = R,(g). (3) A trigger mechanism then activates TTA when the input image a is iden- tified as OOD, i.e., when the reconstruction error €, exceeds a threshold T. Details on how we select the threshold 7 are provided in section 4.2. Once TTA is triggered, the image a is processed by the DAB module, which uses the reconstruction error from the RM to perform input-level adaptation, pro- ducing an adapted input a2*. The adapted input 2° is then passed through the first layer of 7, producing a feature map h;. The DAB transforms h, into its adapted counterpart h{, which replaces h; and is propagated to the next layer of J. This iterative process of adaptation and forward propaga- tion continues layer by layer, ultimately producing the final adapted output y”. In the following, section 3.1 and section 3.2 detail the Reconstruction Module (RM) and the Dynamic Adaptation Block (DAB), respectively. 3.1. Reconstruction Module (RM) The Reconstruction Module (RM), shown in Figure 3 (b), quantifies do- main shift by computing reconstruction errors on both intermediate feature maps within the task model 7 and the generated output. To this end, each layer of 7 is paired with a dedicated reconstruction network in RM, im- plemented as a convolutional autoencoder. These networks {Ri} int... 251 \ R, and Ry, are independently trained on the same data used to train 7, learning the expected distribution of features at their respective levels. Once trained, they are kept frozen to serve as stable references for detecting distri- butional discrepancies. The core assumption is that the reconstruction error measured in inference by each reconstruction network is a proxy for domain shift, identifying deviations between test-time features and those observed during training. At the highest resolution level, we use R, and R,, to pro- duce «* and y?, which are the reconstructions of the adapted input x* and the task model’s output y*%, respectively. The corresponding reconstruction errors are defined as: é = |le* - &"| (4) ey = 9° — oll (5) where £° = R,(a*) and y? = R,(y*) are the reconstructions produced by R, and R,, respectively, and ||-|| denotes the L; distance. At the intermedi- ate feature levels, we employ the set of reconstruction models {Ri} int... 251 \ where n denotes the total number of layers in 7. At each level 7, we concate- nate the encoder and decoder features, leveraging the symmetric structure of T: he, = hi Gh; (6) where @ denotes channel-wise concatenation. The feature map h@, is then passed through the corresponding 7;, yielding hé, = Ri(hé,), with the corresponding reconstruction error defined as €, = ||Re, — Ril. (7) By fusing bottom-up and top-down information, each R;, gains a more com- plete representation of the feature space at level 7, enhancing its ability to detect deviations indicative of domain shift. 3.2. Dynamic Adaptation Block (DAB) This block, illustrated in Figure 3 (c), transforms the input image x and the features h,,ho,...,hy, using the information provided by the RM to improve robustness to domain shift. It is composed of trainable compo- nents, called adaptors, which perform feature-level transformations at mul- tiple stages of the task model 7, and of a dynamic selector determining whether a given feature map should be adapted. Let us remember that the adaptors, which are the only trainable component during TTA, are updated based on feedback from RM, with each reconstruction module R; paired to a corresponding adaptor A; in DAB. To identify the most effective subset of adaptors, we propose a structured search framework that evaluates candidate combinations of reconstruction models within RM, using their feedback to guide the adaptation process and estimate domain shift. Let R = {Ri,..., Ry n= jJ be the set of intermediate reconstruction mod- els. Note that R explicitly excludes R, and R, from the search process: on the one hand, FR, is fixed, as it operates directly on the adapted input image x = A,(a), which always undergoes adaptation; on the other hand, Ry, is consistently used to monitor the reconstruction error on the adapted output y-. The search space is defined as: Q={wCN|wFAD}={{Rif,...,{Ri, Ro},.-.,R} (8) where each w € (2 represents a valid, non-empty subset of reconstruction models, considered as a candidate configuration for estimating domain shift during TTA. Given a search strategy over the space 2, we evaluate each candidate configuration w € Q using equation 5 to measure the reconstruction error of R, over a limited number of adaptation steps MM. At each step, we perform TTA to generate the adapted output y* = 7“(a*), where J“ denotes the task model that performs inference while using the reconstruction models in w to estimate domain shift and apply the corresponding adaptors. We then compute the reconstruction error ¢, = ||y* — y?||, where y® is the adapted output and y* = R,(y*) is the corresponding reconstruction produced by the reconstruction model R,. The optimal configuration w* is selected as the candidate that achieves the lowest reconstruction error over M steps. In details, we have an input-level adaptor A, and a set of intermediate adaptors {Ai} int... j; Where the number of intermediate adaptors corre- sponds to the first half of the architecture, as each A; is applied symmet- rically to both encoder and decoder layers positioned at depth i and n — 2, 10 respectively. A, applies a sequence of convolutional layers preserving input image size. A; is implemented as a 1 x 1 convolutional layer that transforms the feature maps without altering their spatial resolution. A dynamic selec- tor determines whether a given feature map should be adapted. Based on its state, the intermediate feature h; is either transformed by the adaptor, h? = A;(h;), or left unchanged as h? = I(h;) = hj, where I(-) denotes the identity operator. During TTA, each adaptor is updated independently, allowing it to learn feature-level transformations based on the local charac- teristics of each test sample. Each intermediate adaptor A; is applied both to its corresponding feature h; and to its symmetric counterpart h,_;, lo- cated on the encoder and decoder branches of 7, respectively. This design ensures consistent transformation across symmetric layers while minimizing the overall parameter overhead.

As detailed in Algorithm 1, the method evaluates all possible subsets of reconstruction modules in the config- uration space 2 to identify the optimal feature-level adaptation for each test 11 sample. Adaptation is triggered only when the sample is detected as OOD, i.e., when the output reconstruction error €, exceeds a fixed threshold 7. For each candidate configuration w € 2, the model performs M update steps; the adapted output y* is reconstructed through R, and the corresponding reconstruction error is computed. The configuration that achieves the lowest reconstruction error across all steps is selected as the optimal configuration w* and used for the final prediction. While computationally intensive, this exhaustive strategy enables precise, sample-specific adaptation and serves as the reference implementation throughout this work. 4. Experimental Configuration This section provides a comprehensive overview of the experimental setup used to evaluate the performance of our TTA approach. We first describe the datasets used, including their characteristics and the preprocessing steps applied. We then outline the experiments carried out, including the state- of-the-art competitor selected for comparison. We describe implementation details, covering architectural choices, training configurations, and hyper- parameter settings. Finally, we introduce the evaluation metrics used to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of our approach. 4.1. Datasets We evaluate our approach on two image-to-image translation tasks: LDCT denoising and 7; to T2 MRI translation, whose main characteristics are sum- marized in Table 2. For the first task, we use the Mayo Clinic LDCT-and- Projection Data [20], a public dataset which includes thoracic and abdominal high-dose CT (HDCT) scans and corresponding LDCT data simulated using a quarter-dose protocol. From this dataset, we selected 60 patients compris- ing a total of 17,594 slices. Of these, 10 patients (5,936 slices) were used for training, while the remaining 50 patients (11,658 slices) were used for testing. Preprocessing involved converting the raw DICOM files to Hounsfield Units (HU), selecting a display window centered at —400 HU with a width of 1400 HU, and normalizing all images to the range [-1, 1]. For the second task, we use the BraTS 2018 dataset [21] that contains clinically pre-operative MRI scans acquired from multiple institutions, al- ready preprocessed by the authors. We employed a total of 6,528 paired MRI slices, each consisting of a J)- and a 75-weighted image, amounting to 13,056 images in total. Of these, 5,760 pairs were used for training and 768 12 pairs for testing. We additionally used the [XI dataset [22] as an external test set. It includes paired 7 and T> brain MRI scans collected from two clinical sites using different scanners: Hammersmith Hospital (Philips 3T system) and the Institute of Psychiatry using (Philips 1.5T system). Following [19], the preprocessing included MNI space registration, white matter peak nor- malization, and volume resizing. A total of 70 3D scans were selected from the IXI dataset. From each scan, we extracted 21 axial slices, uniformly spaced between slice indices 120 and 180, using a 3 mm inter-slice distance. This procedure resulted in a final dataset of 2,800 2D slices. It is worth noting that for the LDCT denoising task, no external valida- tion set is used, as the test split of the Mayo Clinic dataset already offers sufficient variability to evaluate generalization. With more than 11,000 test slices, OOD samples occur more frequently, making this setting particularly favorable for evaluating the effectiveness of sample-aware TTA.

Experiments Category Experiment Description No TTA Baseline task model without TTA. Competitors He et al. [19] Static TTA approach from He et al. [19] He et al.” Static TTA approach from He et al. [19] applied at all feature , levels of the task model T. Our Approach TTAcria Sample-aware TTA with exhaustive grid search. Table 3: List of the proposed experiment configurations. As detailed in Table 3, we evaluate our proposed and three competitors; furthermore we also investigated alternative search strategies for our TTA approach, widely discussed in section 5.1. The first competitor, named No TTA, corresponds to the task model without adaptation and serves as a baseline for evaluating the benefits of our TTA strategy. The second config- uration correspond to the approach presented by He et al. [19]. It implements 13 a static TTA method, and, to the best of our knowledge, is the only prior work addressing TTA in the context of image-to-image translation, as men- tioned in section 1. The third configuration, named He et al. *, adopts the same adaptation strategy, integrating it directly into our task model 7 by inserting reconstruction models at all feature levels and applying them uni- formly during inference, without any form of sample-specific selection. This results in a full static adaptation strategy, applied uniformly across the test set, and serves as an ablation baseline for assessing the contribution of dy- namic configuration selection. As mentioned in section 1, applying TTA to ID samples can degrade performance by disrupting the task model’s optimal configuration learned during training. To mitigate this, we adopt a gating mechanism that triggers TTA only when it is likely to be beneficial, using a threshold 7 that is based on the reconstruction error produced by Ry, on each test sample, as we describe in section 3.2. We set 7 equal to the 95” percentiles of the reconstruction error distribution computed over the entire test set. We deem that this choice is reasonable because samples with high reconstruction error are more likely to be OOD and, therefore, better candidates for adaptation. On the other hand, setting the threshold at the 95” percentile is a conservative choice that limits unnecessary adaptation of ID samples, thereby reducing the risk of performance degradation caused by overfitting or instability during test-time updates. This balance helps ensure that TTA is selectively applied to truly uncertain or anomalous cases, rather than introducing noise into confidently handled inputs. Furthermore, to investigate the robustness of the 7 value used we performed a sensitivity analysis that evaluates 7 multiple settings (ie., 85", 90", and 98" percentiles of R,). The results of this analysis, provided in Appendix B, confirm that setting 7 to the 95” percentile is the best choice. 4.3. Implementation details Our model consists of three main components: the task model, which performs the translation task and is implemented as a CycleGAN [23]; the re- construction models, implemented as multi-level convolutional autoencoders; and the adaptors, implemented as 1 x 1 convolutional layers. For more de- tails on the model’s components, please refer to Appendix A. We trained the task models 7 using the Adam Optimizer with an initial learning rate of 2 x 10-4 and a batch size of 8. The training schedule consists of 50 epochs with a fixed learning rate, followed by 50 epochs during which the learning 14 rate decays linearly to zero, for a total of 100 epochs. This strategy balances the need for sufficient iterations to capture complex patterns while mitigating overfitting. The learning rate decay stabilizes convergence in the final stages of training, and the chosen batch size reflects a trade-off between memory constraints and training stability. Each reconstruction model FR was trained independently using Adam op- timizer with the initial learning rate of 1 x 1073, and a batch size of 8. The training schedule consists of 20 epochs with a fixed learning rate, followed by 80 epochs during which the learning rate decays linearly to zero, for a total of 100 epochs. This setup ensures consistency in training dynamics across all reconstruction models while enabling each of them to specialize on different features extracted from the task model. All experiments were conducted on a high-performance computing clus- ter, equipped with one GPU NVIDIA A100, optimized for large-scale deep learning workloads. 4.4. Evaluation metrics We used three well-established image quality assessment metrics to quan- tify the quality of the generated images. They are the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) [24]. The MAE measures the absolute difference between the pixel values of the generated image y and the target image y: 3 1 — MAE(g, y) = — a ll ° S ll ° where m and n are the number of rows and columns in the images, respec- tively, and y;,;, Yi; denotes the pixel elements at the 7-th row and j-th column of y and 4%, respectively. It varies in the range [0,+c00], with a lower MAE indicating a better match between y and y. The PSNR compares the maximum intensity in the generated image (MAX,) with the error between the generated image y and the target image y given by the mean squared error (MSE): . MAX; 15 It varies in the range [0,+00], where higher PSNR values indicate better quality. The SSIM [25] computes the similarity between two images as a function of luminance, contrast, and structure: (2g My + C1) (20 + €2) (H5 + py + c1)(05 + oF + c2) SSIM(y, y) = (11) where jug, {ty are mean intensities of the pixels in y and y, respectively; 0; and oF are the variances, oj, is the covariance whilst c, and cz are constant values to avoid numerical instabilities. The (SSIM) varies in the range [0, 1]: the higher its value, the greater the similarity between the two images. 5. Results and Discussion This section presents a comprehensive evaluation of our sample-aware TTA approach through both quantitative and qualitative analyses across two medical image translation tasks; LDCT denoising and 7, to 7) MRI trans- lation. We first compare the performance of our method against the com- petitors described in section 4.2, followed by a detailed analysis of their core design assumptions and limitations in addressing domain shifts at test time. Next, we presents a visual comparison of the translated outputs, highlighting the qualitative improvements achieved by our method in terms of anatomical fidelity and noise suppression. section 5.1 evaluates alternative search strate- gies for identifying optimal adaptor configurations, and section 5.2 examines the computational costs associated with each search strategy, emphasizing trade-offs between inference cost and adaptation effectiveness. Table 4 summarizes the experimental results, and is organized into three sections according to the translation task: LDCT denoising, T-to-T> MRI translation on the BraTS 2018 dataset, and 7}-to-T, MRI translation on the IXI dataset. For each task, there are four rows corresponding to the configurations presented in section 4.2. By column, each metric in table is divided in two sub-columns A and B. Here, A denotes the full test set, while B C A includes only the samples identified as OOD by our method. OOD samples are selected using a selection threshold 7 set to 95” percentile of the reconstruction error distribution computed over the entire test set, as detailed in section 4.2. In each section, the best-performing results are highlighted in green and demonstrate statistically significant differences from 16 the others, satisfying the Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni correction [26]. Al- though the competitors do not support OOD sample identification, we report their performance on B to enable a comprehensive comparison under OOD conditions.

Metrics are reported for the entire test set A and for the subset B C A. The best results for each task are highlighted in green. The dagger symbol (') denotes results from configurations that do not support OOD sample identification but are evaluated on the subset B Cc A, identified by our approach, to illustrate how these configurations would perform on the detected OOD samples. In the LDCT denoising task, TTAg,;g achieves the highest performance across all three metrics on both the full test set A and the OOD subset B CA, clearly outperforming all competitors. The performance improve- ment is evident on B, where domain shift is more severe, which is expected since TTAg,i;q dynamically tailors the adaptation on a per-sample basis, rather than applying a fixed adaptation across all test samples. The com- parison with the static method proposed by He et al.”, further underscores the importance of the adaptive nature of our approach. While He et al.” provides modest gains over the task model without adaptation, No TTA, it lacks the flexibility to adjust to the specific characteristics of individual test samples. These findings demonstrate that TTAgq not only improves average denoising but also enhances robustness under domain shift, a critical factor in clinical scenarios characterized by low-dose protocols and heterogeneous image quality. Turning to the results for T\-to-T, MRI translation on the BraT'S 2018 dataset, TTAg,jiq does not provide measurable benefits. Our method achieves comparable performance to the task model without adaptation (No TTA) on 17 A and even shows a slight performance drop on the OOD subset B. This out- come is expected, as both the training and test samples are drawn from the same distribution; since the task model already generalizes effectively, TTA provides limited benefit and can even degrade performance. These findings underscore the importance of first assessing the presence of domain shift be- fore applying TTA, highlighting the limitations of indiscriminate adaptation in ID scenarios. To further investigate this hypothesis, we assess the performance of the task model on the [XI dataset, used here as an external test set. In this more realistic setting, where the dataset introduces a substantial domain shift due to differences in scanner types and acquisition protocols, T’T’Ag,;q achieves consistent performance gains across all metrics, with notable improvement on the OOD subset B. He et al. [19] achieves the poorest performance, fail- ing to improve translation quality in either task. This may be due to the uniform application of adaptation via a static design: feature-level adapta- tion is carried out through a fixed set of adaptors inserted at all layers of the task model 7, without accounting for input-specific characteristics or sup- porting dynamic configuration. Additionally, the reconstruction models are trained jointly using a single cumulative loss function, which limits their abil- ity to specialize and reduces their effectiveness in capturing domain shifts. As a result, the adaptors are less capable of applying appropriate feature transformations at different levels of the task model 7. These shortcomings underscore the limitations of a one-size-fits-all adaptation strategy that treats all test samples equally, regardless of whether they are ID or OOD. He et al.” achieve moderately better performance by training each reconstruction model independently, allowing them to capture feature-level variations more effectively and serve as a stronger proxy for measuring domain shift. How- ever, the adaptation mechanism remains static and applied uniformly across all test samples, limiting the adaptors’ ability to tailor feature-level transfor- mations to input-specific characteristics. Although both He et al. [19] and He et al.” do not distinguish between ID and OOD samples, we report their performance on the OOD subset B, as identified by TTAcrq. He et al.” at- tains suboptimal results on the full test set A, confirming that TTA is most effective when selectively applied, but it also fails to improve translation per- formance on the OOD subset B. On the subset B, we further observe that, even when focusing only on OOD samples, fixed reconstruction strategies remain less effective than our approach. This comparison reinforces the im- portance of tailoring the adaptation to the specific distributional properties 18 of each test sample. Figures 2, 3, and 4 show visual comparisons for LDCT denoising and T,-to-T2 MRI translation tasks across different experimental configurations. Each figure follows the same structure: for each dataset, we display the in- put image, the ground truth reference, and the generated outputs produced by the competitors (No TTA, He et al. [19], and He et al.*) alongside our proposed approach, TTAciq.

He et al. {19] (Figure 2 (d)) fails to address these artifacts, while He et al.” (Figure 2 (e)) yields modest improvements, though it applies a fixed adaptation uniformly across all samples. In contrast, TTAcia(Figure 2 (f)) produces improved anatomical fidelity, demonstrating the benefit of sample- specific TTA. These results further stress the importance of tailoring TTA to individual test cases rather than relying on static, one-size-fits-all TTA strategies. Figure 3 shows results for the T)-to-T> MRI translation task on the BraTS 2018 dataset. In this ID setting, the task model without adaptation (No TTA, Figure 3 (c)) already generates visually consistent outputs. None of the TTA methods, neither the competitors nor our proposed approach, pro- vide noticeable improvements and, in some cases, even degrade image quality. This reinforces the observation that when dealing with ID test samples, adap- tation may be unnecessary and can potentially be detrimental. In contrast, turning to Figure 4 shows results for the same translation task on the [XI dataset. Here, the task model model without adaptation (No TTA, Figure 4 (c)) shows evident structural distortions and reduced contrast. He et al. [19] (Figure 4 panel d) fails to correct these artifacts, while He et al.” (Figure 4 (e)) achieves only modest improvements. In contrast, TTAcria (Figure 4 (f)) delivers the highest visual quality, recovering sharper anatomical boundaries and minimizing artifacts. Our thorough analysis confirms the core intu- ition behind sample-aware TTA: while adaptation offers limited benefit ID settings, it becomes essential for improving generalization under significant distribution shifts, provided it is applied selectively and tailored to individual test samples. 5.1. Alternative Search Strategies for Sample-Aware TTA To address the computational overhead of TTAcriq, we investigate alter- native search strategies for dynamic adaptor selection, each differing in how they explore the configuration space 2. As detailed in Table 5, we evaluate six representative search strategies, spanning heuristic and probabilistic ap- proaches, including random searches, named as TTARj9 and TTAgsg, which sample 10 and 50 configurations, respectively; forward selection TTAps, back- ward elimination TTAgpg, and bayesian optimization TTAga. 22 Experiment Description Sample-aware with random search over 10 sampled configu- TTAR10 rations. TT Apso Sample-aware TTA with random search over 50 sampled configurations. TTAgs Sample-aware TTA with forward selection search. TTApE Sample-aware TTA with backward elimination search. TTABA Sample-aware TTA with Bayesian search. Table 5: Summary of alternative search strategies used for sample-aware TTA. Table 6 reports the quantitative metrics in the same format as Table 4. Results on BraTS 2018 are omitted, as prior analysis showed that TTA is ineffective in this setting, making further exploration unnecessary. The table is divided into two sections according to the translation task: LDCT de- noising, and 7, to 75 translation on the [XI dataset. We report the results obtained by each method on both the entire test set A and the subset of OOD samples B Cc A. In the LDCT denoising task, TTAc:iq demonstrates strong overall performance but is not consistently statistically superior to other search strategies, particularly TTApso, as detailed in Appendix D. In contrast, greedy algorithms such as TTArs and TTApg exhibit greater per- formance variability, likely due to their tendency to get stuck in local minima within the search space. Bayesian optimization, TTAga, performs reasonably well but does not outperform simpler alternatives, possibly due to the lim- ited number of trials and the need for careful hyperparameter tuning, which itself introduces additional complexity. Turning to the 7)-to-T2 MRI trans- lation task, we observe a similar pattern: while TTAciq maintains strong performance, its advantage over lighter strategies, such as TTARs9 and even TTArio, is not always statistically significant, as detailed in Appendix D. These findings underscore the effectiveness of random search methods, even with a small number of evaluations, in achieving competitive performance with significant reduction in computational cost. 23 Task Experiment SSIM +t MAE J PSNR t A BCA A BCA A BCA TTAcra 699 + .203 .769 + .289 .060 + .045 063 + .053 28.464 + 5.492 29.204 + 6.137 LDCT TTArso* 699 + .202 764 + .286 061 + .045 066 + .052 28.435+ 5.477 28.625 + 5.899 TTApa 697 £201 734 £275 | ggg +-047 gz +079 | 98 993 +5484 95 745 + 5-450 TTAgria .739 £88771 = 060 | 993 #22 ggg +24 | 20,042 £1998 90.317 #227 MRI TTARi0* 729 + .060 760 + “a 088 + .022 O81 + .022 19.303 + 2:328 19.447 = 1.946 T,-Ty TTArs0* 727 * oS .758 + on 089 +91 082 +2 | 19.676 +1899 19.678 +2275 (IXI) TTArs 716 = 9 749 = 7 | ggg = 100 + 74 | 18.850 = 18384 18.395 * 2019 Table 6: Quantitative comparison of different search strategies for sample-aware TTA.

Computational analysis Turning our attention to the computational cost, Table 7 shows the aver- age inference time and complexity O(-) computed on a single A100 across all tasks. The analysis accounts for both the adaptor update steps and the con- figuration selection process involved in each TTA configuration, along with their corresponding computational complexity. As expected, all alternative search strategies introduce additional computational overhead compared to the baseline. Among them, TTAcriq is by far the most computationally demanding, requiring up to 130 seconds (s) per sample. This is due to its exhaustive exploration of the configuration space 2, whose complexity grows exponentially with the number of intermediate layers n—2, resulting in O(2”~7) operations for each test samples requiring adaptation. To mitigate this cost, we evaluate alternative strategies that reduce the number of config- urations explored while maintaining dynamic and sample-specific adaptation. Random searches, TTARi9 and TTARs0, with Neon fig equal to 10 and 50, re- spectively, limit the search to 10 or 50 configurations, respectively, achieving inference times of 12 s and 55s. As expected, their complexity scales lin- early with the number of sampled configurations, i.e, O(Neonsig), offering 24 a trade-off between speed and performance. TTApsg and TTAgg achieve a more favorable balance, with inference times around 25 s and 21 s. Their quadratic complexity O((n — 2)?) reflects the structured, iterative nature of the search over n—2 intermediate layers. Finally, TTAga offers a principled compromise, with a fixed budget of Neon fig = 20 trials guided by a proba- bilistic surrogate model. While its complexity remains linear in the number of evaluations, the targeted search effectively avoids unnecessary configura- tions, resulting in inference times of approximately 20 s. While TTAcria remains the most exhaustive and frequently top-performing strategy, our statistical analysis reveals that its performance is not always consistently or significantly superior to lighter alternatives. In particular, approaches such as TTArso often achieve comparable results without incurring the high com- putational cost of a grid search. This suggests that, in practice, more efficient search strategies can provide a favorable trade-off between adaptation quality and inference time, offering competitive performance with significantly lower resource demands.

Conclusions In this paper, we introduce an approach for sample-aware TTA in medical image-to-image translation. The core contributions of this work are twofold: (1) a reconstruction module that quantifies reconstruction errors across all feature levels of a pretrained task model 7, serving as a proxy for domain 25 shift; and (2) a dynamic adaptation block that applies feature-level transfor- mations at multiple stages of 7, guided by the reconstruction errors identified by the reconstruction module. Through extensive evaluation on LDCT de- noising and 7\-to-7j MRI translation tasks, we demonstrate that TTA is most effective when applied selectively. While indiscriminate adaptation can degrade performance on ID samples, our method delivers substantial im- provements on OOD cases by tailoring the adaptation on a per-sample basis. We show that dynamically selecting the optimal adaptation configuration on a per-sample basis outperforms static, one-size-fits-all approaches in both quantitative metrics and computational efficiency. These findings highlight the importance of balancing adaptation quality with runtime constraints, a critical consideration for real-world deployment. Limitations and Future Work. Despite these promising results, our approach has some limitations. First, OOD detection relies on a fixed percentile thresh- old applied to reconstruction error, which may not generalize optimally across tasks or domains. Second, although we mitigate the overhead of configuration search, the process still introduces latency that may limit its use in real-time or resource-constrained settings. Third, our current implementation oper- ates on 2D slices, consistent with most prior work in medical image-to-image translation. This choice reflects not only computational considerations, but also our primary goal: to introduce and systematically evaluate a novel TTA strategy, rather than to optimize translation performance. Working in 2D enables controlled benchmarking of sample-specific adaptation mechanisms. However, this formulation does not capture volumetric consistency, which re- mains essential for many clinical applications. As a first direction for future work, we aim to improve OOD detection by exploring more advanced selec- tion strategies, such as learned thresholds, outlier detection techniques, or uncertainty-based scoring. Additionally, we will investigate adaptive mech- anisms for more efficient and generalizable adaptor selection across diverse generative tasks and data modalities. We also plan to extend our frame- work to a broader range of generative architectures such as diffusion models or vision transformers, evaluating its model-agnostic capabilities and its ro- bustness in real-time and multi-modal deployment scenarios. Lastly, we plan to extend our framework to 3D architectures such as volumetric GANs or dif- fusion models, leveraging the modularity of our adaptation design to support fully volumetric adaptation. 26 7.

CycleGAN CycleGAN [23], introduced in 2017, made significant changes to the tradi- tional GANs’ architecture [27], enabling bidirectional image-to-image trans- lation. Unlike standard GANs, which focus on unidirectional translation, CycleGAN revolutionizes this paradigm, allowing both the translation from the source domain to the target domain and the reverse translation from syn- thetic target images back to the source domain. This dual transformation enhances model stability and improves the accuracy of generated images, es- pecially in unpaired settings, where paired training data is unavailable. The Dx A G —pid—j @ D — x F Dy Dx G PF f ; Figure A.5: CycleGAN Architecture. CycleGAN framework, as shown in figure A.5 includes two mapping func- tions, known as generators: G: X > Y and F: Y > X, where X is the source image domain while Y is the target image domain. It also includes two discriminators, Dx and Dy, which evaluate the authenticity of images translated between these domains. In particular, the role of the discrimina- tor Dy is to differentiate between samples generated by G(x) and authentic samples from domain Y, while Dx distinguishes between generated samples Fy) and the real samples of the X domain. CycleGAN is composed of two loops: the consistency of the forward cycle and the consistency of the back- ward cycle. The first loop is a mapping from the source image domain X to the target image domain Y and then a mapping from the target image domain back to the source image domain; therefore, the image translation process must ensure that any image x belonging to X, when translated into domain Y, and then returned to domain X, remains approximately the same original image «x. zr G(r) =9 > F(y) =%. (A.1) Similarly, the second loop is a mapping from the target image domain to the source image domain and then a mapping from the source image domain ol back to the target image domain. So, for any image y from domain Y, the process should ensure that after being translated to domain X, and then back to domain Y, it remains almost identical to the original image y. y > Fly) =% > G(4z) = 4. (A.2) The CycleGAN optimization function is formulated as a minimax problem, in which the generators and discriminators are trained simultaneously. The goal is to find the optimal parameters for both the generators and discrimi- nators that minimize the ability of the discriminators to distinguish between generated and real samples. The minimax formulation is expressed as: The performance of these networks is therefore highly dependent on how their loss functions are structured, so special attention must be paid to them. The loss used in CycleGAN is composed of three terms: adversarial loss, cycle consistency loss and identity loss. The first term is applied to both mapping functions. For the mapping function G : X — Y and its discriminator Dy, we express the objective as: where G tries to generate images G(x) that look similar to images from domain Y, while Dy aims to distinguish between translated samples G(x) and real samples y. Leaan(G, Dy, X, Y) = Ey pata (y) [log Dy (y)| +E a~panta (a) [log (1 ~ Dy (G(a)))] ° (A.4) For the mapping function Ff’: Y > X and its discriminator Dx as well we have: Lean(F, D,,Y, Xx) = Ea paata (a) [log Dx (©)|+Eyvpasta(y) [log (1 ~ Dx(F(y)))| . (A.5) Where Eyvnaaia(y)> Ex~paata(z) Fepresent, respectively, the expectation with re- spect to the distribution of real images in the Y and X domains. Dy(y) is the probability that image y is deemed authentic in domain Y by discrim- inator Dy; Dy(G(x)) represents the probability that the discriminator Dy classifies the generated images G(x) as authentic within domain Y. On the other hand, Dx(z) is the probability that image x is deemed authentic in domain X by discriminator Dy and Dx(F'(y)) represents the probability that the discriminator Dy classifies the generated images F'(y) as authentic within domain X. Lagy is the sum of A.4 and A.5 expressions. 32 In CycleGANs, compared to traditional GANs, a new loss, known as Cycle Consistency Loss, is introduced, which further regularizes the mappings: for each image x of domain X, the image translation cycle must be able to bring x back to the original image. This is called forward cycle consistency. Simi- larly, for each image y from domain Y,G and F' should also satisfy backward cycle consistency. Leye(G, F) = Eanpaata(e) ULF (G(®)) — li] + Eyepeataty) IG) = lla] (A.6) In this case, the loss is computed using the L1 norm. The third term, the Identity loss, acts as an additional parameter aimed at elevating the overall quality of the generated images. This loss has special relevance to avoid unwanted modifications when an image already belongs to the target domain. The essence of identity loss is to take a sample x from the target domain X and pass it through generator G. Similarly, a sample y from the target domain Y is passed through generator F’. In this way, both generators learn the identity mapping functions for their respective domains. The equation representing the loss of identity is expressed as follows: Lidentity(G, F) = Exwpeaca(e) [G(@) — alli] + Evrae) FY) — ull] (A-7) Also in this case, the loss is computed using the L1 norm. So we can resume that the CycleGAN loss is: Loan(G, FP, Dx, Dy) = Laav(G, FP, Dx, Dy) +A Leycte(G, F)+A2Liaentity(G, F) (A.8) Appendiz A.2. Autoencoder Autoencoders [28] are a class of neural networks designed for unsuper- vised learning, in which the primary goal is to learn an efficient encoding of the input data while allowing accurate reconstruction of the original input. This process makes them particularly suitable for tasks aimed at dimension- ality reduction, feature extraction, and data reconstruction. An Autoencoder consists of two main modules: e Encoder: This module compresses the input data into a compact la- tent representation, capturing the most salient and essential features of the data. The encoder reduces the input dimensionality, discarding irrelevant or redundant information. 33 e Decoder: Reconstructs the input data from the compressed latent rep- resentation. Its goal is to recreate the original data as faithfully as possible, effectively reversing the transformation applied by the en- coder. Autoencoder training is controlled by a reconstruction loss function, which measures the difference between the input data and its reconstruction. The choice of loss function significantly affects the model’s ability to learn rele- vant features. Commonly used loss functions include Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). In our case, the MSE, defined as in following equation, was chosen. N 1 * where x; is the 2-th pixel of the input image, 7; is the corresponding pixel in the reconstructed image, and N is the total number of pixels. This type of loss is ideal for tasks requiring pixel-level accuracy. Appendiz A.2.1. Alternative reconstruction models For completeness, we also tested an alternative reconstruction architec- ture based on the generator of Pix2Pix [29], which employs a U-Net structure with skip connections and adversarial training. Despite its strong generaliza- tion capabilities in image-to-image translation tasks, Pix2Pix yielded inferior performance in the reconstruction-based TTA framework. In the LDCT de- noising task, the TTAc,iq configuration with Pix2Pix achieved lower results (SSIM: .671+.285, MAE: .086+.074, PSNR: 26.201+5.761) compared to our autoencoder-based reconstruction models. We hypothesize that Pix2Pix’s tendency to generalize across domains reduces its sensitivity to subtle dis- tribution shifts, making it less suitable for TTA, where fine-grained domain discrepancies must be identified and corrected. Based on these observations, we opted to use autoencoders as reconstruction models throughout our ex- periments. Appendiz A.3. Adaptors The adaptors are implemented as individual 1 x 1 convolutional layers. Each feature-level adaptor consists of a 1 x 1 convolution that preserves the spatial resolution of the feature maps while altering their channel-wise rep- resentation. The input-level adaptor, in contrast, operates directly on the 34 input image using a sequence of convolutions that maintain its spatial dimen- sions. In both cases, the use of 1 x 1 convolutions ensures that the spatial structure of the image remains unchanged, while enabling pixel-wise modula- tion of feature information. Adaptors are placed at each level corresponding to a reconstruction model, with the exception of the final output layer, which remains unmodified. Their purpose is to apply sample-specific transforma- tions aimed at reducing domain shift, as estimated by the reconstruction error computed from the reconstruction models. 39 Appendix B. Sensitivity Analysis on Threshold Selection To complement the results presented in the main manuscript (based on the 95" percentile threshold), we report here the performance metrics ob- tained using alternative thresholds of 85”, 90°” and 98"" percentiles. These thresholds were applied to determine the subset of test samples requiring TTA, denoted as B C A. It is worth noting that, due to rounding to four decimal places, the 85” and 90 percentiles resulted in the same numerical threshold on the BraTS dataset. The results show that selecting 7 equal to the 95" percentile provides the best overall trade-off. On the one hand, lower values of 7 yield a more liberal selection strategy, triggering adaptation for a larger portion of the test set. While this can enhance performance on highly shifted samples, it also increases the risk of unnecessary adaptation on ID data, potentially leading to performance degradation due to overfitting or instability. On the other hand, higher values of 7 result in a conservative approach, limiting adapta- tion to only the most anomalous cases. This minimizes the risk of harming ID performance but may miss moderately shifted OOD samples that could benefit from adaptation. Furthermore, since TTA involves non-negligible computational overhead, overly permissive thresholds, i.e., low 7 values, may incur unnecessary cost by adapting a large number of samples that do not significantly benefit from it. Therefore, the 95” percentile threshold emerges as a reasonable and robust compromise between effectiveness, selectivity, and computational efficiency. For the 7; to 7; MRI translation task, the [XI dataset was used solely as an external test set for OOD evaluation. Therefore, we did not perform a sensitivity analysis on this dataset. Instead, we applied the threshold selected on the BraTS 2018 dataset ensuring that the choice is not biased by the test data distribution and mimics a realistic deployment setting. Appendiz B.1.

Alternative search strategies To complement the exhaustive grid search used in our main implementa- tion, we evaluated four additional strategies for selecting the optimal subset of reconstruction modules for each OOD test sample. All these strategies op- erate within the same sample-aware TTA framework and aim to reduce the computational burden of adaptation while preserving its dynamic, sample- specific nature. Random Search. Algorithm 2 implements a random sampling scheme in which only a fixed number Neonsg of configurations are sampled from the full search space 2. This significantly reduces computational cost compared to exhaus- tive search. However, the resulting configuration may be suboptimal, as random sampling can fail to explore informative regions of the space, espe- cially for small Neonig. In our experiments, we explore this strategy with Neonfig = 10 and Neonfig = 50. Forward Selection. Algorithm 3 introduces a greedy strategy that starts from a minimal configuration containing only the fixed reconstruction modules at the input and output levels (R, and Ry). The set of selected intermediate reconstruction models, Reo, is initially empty and is iteratively expanded by adding one candidate model at a time. At each step, the configuration 39 yielding the lowest reconstruction error €, = |y* — y®| is retained, and the process stops when no further improvement is observed. Backward Elimination. In contrast, Algorithm 4 starts from a full config- uration in which all intermediate reconstruction models are included, i.e., Ree = R. At each step, the algorithm evaluates reduced configurations ob- tained by removing one model at a time. If a reduced configuration yields lower reconstruction error, it is adopted as the new candidate. The pro- cess terminates once further removals degrade performance, and the best- performing configuration w* is retained. Bayesian Optimization. Finally, Algorithm 5 implements a model-based strat- egy that builds a surrogate of the objective function to guide the search. The first Nstart = 5 configurations are sampled randomly to initialize the history of evaluations. Subsequent Nnérials — Nstart, With Ntrials = 20 iterations are driven by a Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) sampler, a probabilis- tic model that balances exploration and exploitation [80, 31, 32].

Wilcoxon Test To assess the statistical significance of performance differences between methods, we employ the Wilcoxon signed-rank test [33], a non-parametric test suitable for paired, non-normally distributed data. It is particularly ap- propriate for our setting, as it compares the distributions of metric values (e.g., SSIM, MAE, PSNR) across all test samples without assuming Gaus- sianity, and it is robust to outliers. We perform pairwise comparisons between all evaluated methods, independently for each metric, and apply a Bonferroni correction to account for the increased risk of Type I error due to multiple comparisons [26]. We use a corrected significance threshold Qo = 0.08 where m is the number of pairwise comparisons. Results are summarized in com- pact tables, where each cell corresponds to a pairwise comparison (row vs. column), and is subdivided into three subcells showing the p-values for SSIM, MAE, and PSNR. Green subcells indicate statistically significant differences (p < Qcorr), while red subcells denote non-significant differences (p > Qcorr). This analysis supports a robust comparison of all TTA configurations and highlights whether observed improvements are consistent and statistically reliable. Wilcoxon test results are reported in Table D.13, and Table D.14, which correspond to the Mayo Clinic LDCT-and-Projection dataset [20], and [XI dataset [22], respectively. No statistical test was performed on the BraTS 2018 dataset [21], as TTA consistently degrades performance in this pre- dominantly ID scenario. Consequently, we did not explore additional search strategies in this setting. 45 TT Aria TT Ario TT Apso TT Ars TTApe TT Apa NoTTA Table D.13: Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni correction for denoising task.

2508 .00707v1 [cs.LG] 1 Aug 2025 arXiv Efficient Solution and Learning of Robust Factored MDPs Yannik Schnitzer, Alessandro Abate, David Parker University of Oxford Department of Computer Science {yannik.schnitzer,alessandro.abate,david parker} @cs.ox.ac.uk Abstract Robust Markov decision processes (r-MDPs) extend MDPs by explicitly modelling epistemic uncertainty about transition dynamics. Learning r-MDPs from interactions with an un- known environment enables the synthesis of robust policies with provable (PAC) guarantees on performance, but this can require a large number of sample interactions. We propose novel methods for solving and learning r-MDPs based on fac- tored state-space representations that leverage the indepen- dence between model uncertainty across system components. Although policy synthesis for factored r-MDPs leads to hard, non-convex optimisation problems, we show how to reformu- late these into tractable linear programs. Building on these, we also propose methods to learn factored model representa- tions directly. Our experimental results show that exploiting factored structure can yield dimensional gains in sample effi- ciency, producing more effective robust policies with tighter performance guarantees than state-of-the-art methods. 1 Introduction Markov decision processes (MDPs) are the standard mod- elling framework for sequential decision-making under un- certainty. However, real-world dynamics are often complex and not fully known. In safety-critical settings, it is there- fore essential to reason about epistemic uncertainty, due to incomplete knowledge of the environment, and to construct robust policies that provide provable performance guaran- tees on the unknown environment they operate in. Robust Markov decision processes (t-MDPs) (Wiese- mann, Kuhn, and Rustem 2013) extend MDPs by not re- quiring every transition probability to be known precisely but only restricting them to lie in a given uncertainty set. These uncertainty sets are typically derived from data, e.g., observed interactions with the unknown system, as in re- inforcement learning (RL). Learning for r-MDPs, however, does not optimise for expected performance alone; rather, it enables the synthesis of policies that are robust with re- spect to the current epistemic uncertainty in the transition dynamics and provides provable Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) guarantees on performance with high con- fidence (Strehl and Littman 2005; Suilen et al. 2022). Unlike robust RL approaches, that often focus on heuristic or empirical training for difficult scenarios (Morimoto and Atkeson 2002; Pinto et al. 2017), r-MDP learning operates on explicit uncertainty sets learned from data and yields for- mal anytime guarantees on worst-case performance under the true but unknown transition model. A practical limitation of r-MDP learning and policy syn- thesis, however, is that, to achieve high-confidence per- formance guarantees, the overall confidence level must be distributed across all transition distributions (Strehl and Littman 2005) or individual transition probabilities (Suilen et al. 2022) being learnt. In large-scale environments, this enforces stringent confidence requirements, requiring a high number of samples to construct tight uncertainty sets that yield effective robust policies with meaningful guarantees. Many real-world domains come with structural knowl- edge that permits distinct features of the state space to be modelled independently, giving rise to the model of factored MDPs (f-MDPs) (Koller and Parr 1999; Boutilier, Dean, and Hanks 1999). RL algorithms have been extended to exploit this factored structure (Kearns and Koller 1999; Guestrin, Patrascu, and Schuurmans 2002; Strehl 2007), often yielding exponential improvements in sample efficiency over learn- ing in the flat (non-factored) representation. While these methods come with PAC guarantees, ensuring that a near- optimal policy is learned with high probability in time poly- nomial in the factored representation, existing work focuses on expected performance and convergence rather than pro- viding provable guarantees on worst-case performance. In this work, we introduce a robust factored MDP frame- work, which leverages structural independence to construct uncertainty sets for each state factor rather than for a flat model. We show that robust policy synthesis in this set- ting leads to intractable non-convex optimisation problems, but that for standard uncertainty classes, such as confidence intervals, L; balls and general polytopes, these problems admit exact convex reformulations. To address the compu- tational challenges of the resulting, potentially exponential constraint sets, we leverage convex relaxations that preserve tight performance guarantees while enabling efficient solu- tion. We show that our method synthesises more effective robust policies with high-confidence performance guaran- tees that are substantially tighter than those of prior factored MDP learning approaches. Furthermore, we show that ex- ploiting the factored structure can improve the sample ef- ficiency of robust policy learning by orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art methods in flat representations. 2 Problem Formulation The set of all probability distributions over a finite set Y is denoted by A(Y) = {p: Y > [0,1] | Mycy ply) = 1}. For convenience, we also represent distributions as vectors in the probability simplex, (pj, ... , Py) € Ajy), where pi = p(y;) under a fixed ordering of the elements of Y. 2.1 MODPs and Factored MDPs A Markov decision process (or MDP) is a tuple M = (S,A,T,1r), where S and A are finite sets of states and ac- tions, T: S x A — A(S) is a transition probability func- tion, and r: S x A — R is a reward function. A policy is a mapping 7: (S x A)* x S — A(A) that resolves the non- determinism by selecting a distribution over actions based on the current state and past interactions. The interaction be- tween a policy and an MDP induces infinite sequences (or paths) of the form s°a°s'a!..., where at each step, the next action is drawn from the distribution assigned by the policy, given the current history prefix, and the next state is drawn from the transition distribution T( - |s, a). A factored MDP (or f-MDP) is an MDP in which states are represented as vectors of m components X = {X1,...,Xn}. Each factor X; (also referred to as a state variable or state marginal) takes values from a finite domain D(X;). Hence, states are tuples (1,...,2n), with a; € D(X;). To capture the (in-)dependence between factors, we adopt the framework of Strehl (2007). Given a finite set Z of dependency identifiers, a function D: S x Ax X > Tisa dependency function. The transition function is defined as n T(s'|s,a) = ]] P(si|D(s, a, X;)), (1) i=l where s’ denotes the i-th component of the next state s’ and each P(-|D(s,a,X;)) € A(D(X;)) specifies the marginal probability distribution of the respective factor. Example 1. A classic example of a factored MDP is the System Administrator domain (Guestrin, Patrascu, and Schuurmans 2002), where an administrator controls a total of n machines or factors, each of which can be either oper- ational or in a failure state. Each machine is connected to a subset of the others, and its probability of failing at the next step depends on whether its connected neighbours are oper- ational, but is independent of all other machines. The depen- dency identifiers for machine 7 thus capture the current state of the machine itself and those of its connected neighbours: if one or more of these neighbours are in a failure state, the marginal probability that machine 27 fails increases. 2.2 Robust Factored MDPs Robust factored MDPs (or rf-MDPs) (Delgado et al. 2009; Liu, Wiesemann, and Yue 2024) extend factored MDPs to incorporate epistemic uncertainty about transition dynam- ics. They generalise fixed marginal transition distributions P(-|D(s,a, X;)) € A(D(X;)) to marginal uncertainty sets P(D(s, a, X;)) C A(D(X;)). The overall uncertainty set of possible transition distributions at (s, a) is then defined as: i=l where ® denotes the outer product (or Kronecker product) of distributions, extended to sets. Specifically, for sets P C A(D(X;)) and Q C A(D(X;)), the product is defined as P®QW={POQ|PEP, QED, (3) where for distributions P = (pi,...,Pm) and Q = (q1,---5 4k), their outer product is given by (P@Q)ij=pig, 1 y'r(s‘,a°), (6) t=0 for some discount factor 0 < y < 1. However, our re- sults readily extend to other objectives, such as undiscounted rewards (Schwartz 1993; Puterman 1994; Meggendorfer, Weininger, and Wienhdft 2025) or reachability goals fo- cussing on the probability of eventually reaching a target set of states, possibly whilst avoiding certain undesirable states. Robust Values and Policies The optimal robust policy x* in an rf-MDP MM is the policy that achieves, in every state, the optimal robust value V~,(s), which is the best possible value under the worst-case environment policy. Formally: Vis) = sup inf Viv" (s), and (7) m* = argsup inf Vir (s). (8) In this paper, we implicitly assume that the agent aims to maximise the objective while the environment adversari- ally seeks to minimise it. All results remain valid under the dual case with reversed roles (Nilim and Ghaoui 2005). It is straightforward to verify that the policy 7* guarantees at least the value V* (s) on any concrete f-MDP obtained by fixing specific distributions from the uncertainty sets. Next, in Section 3, we present novel methods for ef- ficiently and accurately solving rf-MDPs, i.e., computing optimal robust values and policies, assuming polytopic marginal uncertainty sets, such as the commonly used 11, Lg, balls and general L,, balls. Then, in Section 4, we lever- age these methods to efficiently learn robust policies with provable performance guarantees in unknown f-MDPs. 3 Solving Robust Factored MDPs As for standard robust MDPs, the optimal value function V;, and a corresponding robust policy for an rf-MDP can be computed with robust value iteration (Iyengar 2005; Nilim and Ghaoui 2005). Assuming rectangular uncertainty sets, meaning that each state—action pair has an independent un- certainty set over which the environment can act adversari- ally, the global problem decouples into a local optimisation at every state. For any state s, the agent selects an action a € A that maximises the worst-case expected return over all transition kernels in 7 (s, a), yielding the robust Bellman equation, where V* (s) equals: .a) +y ¥° T(s'|s,0) VE (s')]. max min [r(s,a) 1D (s'|s,a)Vi,(s')]. Inner Optimisation The inner optimisation captures the environment’s adversar- ial choice of a transition kernel within 7 (s, a). For standard (non-factored) robust MDPs, this is tractable when 7(s, a) has a favourable geometry: e.g., an LD; or Lo ball, which is solvable via bisection in time linear-logarithmic in the sup- port size (Strehl and Littman 2005), or a polytope described by a number of vertices or half-spaces that can be solved via linear programming (Nilim and Ghaoui 2005). rf-MDPs, however, induce uncertainty sets 7 (s, a) as the multilinear product of marginal sets (see Equation (2)). Even if every marginal P(D(s,a,X;)) is convex, convexity is in general not preserved under the product; consequently, T (s, a) can in general be non-convex (see Figure 1), render- ing the inner optimisation hard and often intractable. We show that when the marginals are polytopes, the asso- ciated non-linear problem admits an exact linear reformula- tion whose constraints follow directly from the polytopic de- scriptions of the marginals. However, the number of result- ing constraints can grow rapidly for many common classes of uncertainty sets. To retain tractability, we construct tight linear overapproximations of J (s, a), yielding robust Bell- man updates that allow for an efficient and accurate solution. 3.1 Exact Products of Polytopic Uncertainty Sets We consider polytopic marginal uncertainty sets P defined as the convex hull of finitely many extreme distributions, P2° qo (b) Product States and Uncertainty Set (a) Marginal States and Uncertainty Sets Figure |: Part (a) shows two factors of an rf-MDP, with con- vex marginal uncertainty sets P and Q, which are line seg- ments in the two-dimensional probability simplex. The re- sulting product uncertainty set P @ Q in (b) is non-convex. ie., P = conv{P®,..., POM} = {TT APO | Ay > 0, oy, Ai = 1}. We first prove that the resulting inner op- timisation problem in (9), taken over the non-convex prod- uct uncertainty set 7 (s, a), admits an exact linear reformu- lation. In contrast to prior approaches for solving robust fac- tored MDPs (Delgado, Sanner, and de Barros 2011), this re- sult allows us to avoid the invocation of an expensive and po- tentially approximate non-linear solver. It builds on two key observations: first, by the bilinearity of the Kronecker prod- uct ® (Horn and Johnson 1991), the convex hull of T(s, a) is a polytope whose extreme points are precisely the pair- wise products of the extreme distributions of the marginal polytopes (Horst and Tuy 1996), and second, the inner op- timisation is linear in the transition probabilities and thus attains its optimum at a vertex of the convex hull. Theorem 1. Let P = conv{P™,...,P°™} C Any and Q = conv{Q™,...,Q®} C An be polytopic marginal uncertainty sets. Then the corresponding non-linear inner optimisation problem in Equation (9) attains its optimum at one of the products of the marginal extreme distributions: {PX aQ” |isi pat+4qp-P4, (12a) h>pq+aP—DPG, (12b) h p and q > q, we have (p—p)(q—q) = 9. Expanding and substituting h = pq gives pa-pqa-qp+pqa20 = h=pqt+aqp-pa, which is precisely Equation (12a). Despite their simplicity, these inequalities suffice to exactly characterise the convex hull of a single bilinear product h = pg (McCormick 1976). When applied to the inner optimisation in Equation (9) over a product uncertainty set as per Equation (2), each bilin- ear term p;q; is replaced by an auxiliary variable h;;, which is constrained by the four McCormick inequalities in (12). We then impose the global simplex constraint yi, j hij =1, ensuring that the auxiliaries {h,;};,; define a valid proba- bility distribution. This reformulation linearises the original non-linear inner optimisation. Figure 2 illustrates how the McCormick relaxation excludes many of the spurious ex- treme points admitted by the interval-arithmetic relaxation, thus resulting in less conservative solutions and more effec- tive (whilst still robust) policies. Furthermore, since each h;; contributes to exactly four McCormick constraints, the to- tal number of constraints grows only polynomially with the marginal supports, yielding a tractable inner linear program. Full details of this construction and its extension to products of more than two marginal uncertainty sets (obtained by re- cursive applications) are provided in Appendix B. Relaxations for L, Uncertainty Sets. The constructions above enable the exact composition of polytopic uncertainty sets and provide tight-yet-tractable relaxations for box-type uncertainty sets. We now also consider uncertainty sets that are L,, norm balls centred at a nominal distribution Pea N; which are typically estimated from observed data as: Pp(P,2) = {P € An | ||P— Pllp < eh. These sets are generally not polytopic, for 1 < p < oo. We hence extend a result from Strehl (2007), originally formu- lated for the composition of L balls, to arbitrary L,, norms: Theorem 2. Let P,(P, €1) and P,(Q, €2) be two Ly uncer- tainty sets for some 1 < p < oo. Then: Py(P,€1) ® Pp(Q, €2) C Pp(P ® Q,e1 + £2). We provide the proof in Appendix A. This result offers an alternative approach to solving non-polytopic rf-MDPs, complementing the constructions presented in Section 3.2. When applied to L; uncertainty sets, it directly extends the PAC analysis of Strehl (2007) to robust policy synthesis. In Section 5, we compare the various relaxations, showing that our constructions yield substantially tighter uncertainty sets, enable more sample-efficient learning, and deliver ro- bust policies with stronger performance guarantees. 4 Robust Policy Learning in Factored MDPs We now introduce a novel learning approach that integrates factored model estimation with accurate and tractable ro- bust planning, generating policies that are provably robust for unknown f-MDPs. Based on agent interactions with the environment, we derive marginal uncertainty sets, such as confidence intervals or L; balls, which induce a polytopic rf-MDP. Leveraging the solution methods in the previous section, we exploit this factored structure to achieve dimen- sional gains in sample efficiency compared to existing robust learning methods in flat models, as we demonstrate in our experimental evaluation. Crucially, our approach provides a finite-sample, anytime PAC guarantee: after any number of interactions, we can bound the worst-case performance in the unknown MDP with high confidence. We consider a factored MDP M with known state space but unknown (marginal) transition distributions. For clarity, we assume that the reward function is known, but all re- sults extend to the case of unknown reward functions (Strehl and Littman 2005). Our algorithm has access to agent- environment interactions in the form of a dataset of tran- sition samples C = {(S¢, az, 5;)}z, where a, is the action taken in state s; under some exploration policy and s}, is the observed successor state. We remain agnostic to the precise sampling mechanism and assume that the sample set C is given. In Section 5, we describe the specific sampling pro- cedure used in our evaluation. From the definition of a factored MDP, we first identify the relevant transition components that must be estimated. For a state—action pair (s, a), the relevant dependencies are Ds,a = {(Xi, 3) EXxT | j = D(s,a, X;)}. Aggregating over all state—action pairs yields the set of rel- evant transition components: OQ = U ajeSxA Ds,a, 80 that |Q| counts the number of marginal transition distribu- tions to be estimated. The total number of unknown transi- tion probabilities is the sum of the supports of the marginals: U = Yox jeg Supp (P(- | j))|- For a sample dataset C = {(S+, az, 54) }z, we define the realisation counts: S> 1(D(s, a, X;) =jA s= xi), (s,a,s’)EC n(xi,J) = and the component counts: SS) SO 1(D(s,4, Xi) = 5), (s,a,s’)EC XiEX n(j) = for x; € D(X;) and j € TZ. Here, n(j) is the total number of encountered transitions whose transition probability dis- tribution involves a marginal with dependency identifier 7, while n(a;, 7) records how often such transitions lead to the marginal state component «;. From this we can derive the empirical estimates of the marginal distributions as n(si,, D(s, a, X;)) n(D(s,a,X;)) While this empirical estimate becomes increasingly accurate with more data, it provides no quantification of uncertainty. We aim to synthesise a policy that, after any fixed number of samples, comes with a guaranteed lower bound on its per- formance in the unknown f-MDP. To achieve this, we inflate each point estimate into a high-confidence uncertainty set over the marginal distribution, thereby defining an rf-MDP. P(s}|D(s,a, Xi)) = (13) 4.1 Uncertainty Set Construction We consider two established methods for constructing un- certainty sets. The first builds exact binomial confidence intervals for each transition probability, treating each out- come s’, under dependency j = D(s,a, X;) as a Bernoulli trial (Suilen et al. 2022; Meggendorfer, Weininger, and Wienhoft 2024). Given « = n(si,7) “successes” inn = n(j) trials and an error probability 6 € (0, 1), the true tran- sition probability P(s‘ | 7) lies in the interval: CP(s), 7) = [B(2;2, n—x+l), B(l- Ssa+1, n—2x)| with probability at least 1 — 6, where B(a; u, v) denotes the a-quantile of the Beta(u, v) distribution (Clopper and Pear- son 1934). Applying these bounds independently to each transition component defines the box-type uncertainty sets P(j) = { Pe A(D(X)) | P'(s)) € CPCs) si}, to which our rf-MDP solution techniques apply directly. Throughout, we assume n(j) > 0. When n(j) = 0, we set the uncertainty sets as the entire probability simplex. The second approach centres on an L;-norm ball around the empirical marginal distribution P(-| 7). For each rele- vant dependency identifier 7 = D(s,a, X;) € Q, we set PUj) = { PE A(X) | IP) = PC Lh se}. where ¢€ follows from Weissman et al. (2003) as . i 2[In(24 — 2) — In(3)] n(j) This ensures that the true marginal lies in P(j) with proba- bility at least 1— 6. This approach underpins the native PAC- learning results for both factored and standard MDPs (Strehl and Littman 2005; Strehl 2007). Moreover, it yields poly- topic uncertainty sets, as the intersection of an Lj, ball with the probability simplex is still a polytope, thus permitting ex- act composition via Theorem |. However, L, balls do not in- tegrate naturally into the McCormick relaxation without fur- ther overapproximating them as box-type sets. As we show in Appendix D, overapproximating L, balls by their smallest enclosing box always yields a looser uncertainty set than ap- plying the box-type construction directly. Consequently, the radius-sum result of Theorem 2 is the natural choice when composing L, marginal sets with a large number of vertices. a = |supp(P(- | /))]- 4.2 Provably Robust Policy Synthesis To obtain a provably robust policy with quantifiable perfor- mance guarantees in the unknown f-MDP M, we construct an rf-MDP / using the uncertainty sets described above. For the guarantees to be meaningful, we must ensure that the unknown MDP & is contained in M (denoted M € M) with high, user-specified confidence. This means that every marginal distribution P( -|j) for (X;, 7) € Q must lie within its corresponding uncertainty set P(j). Given a desired overall confidence probability 1 — 8, we follow the standard approach of Strehl (2007) and distribute the total error probability 8 € (0,1) across all learnt dis- tributions/transitions. Under the L,, scheme, this results in 56 = 6/U, and under the L; scheme, in 6 = 3/|Q|. By the union bound, this ensures that MM € M with probability at least 1 — G, regardless of the number of observed samples. When solving the learned rf-MDP M using a robust, i.e., either exact or relaxation-based method from Section 3, the following performance guarantee for the resulting robust policy on the true, unknown f-MDP &/ follows immediately: Theorem 3. Let M be an f-MDP and M an rf-MDP such that Pr[M € M] > 1-8 for some 8 > 0. Let x* be the policy obtained by solving M with a robust solution method, and let Ve (s) denote its corresponding robust value. Then, Pr[Vir (8) = Var (s)] 21-8 a4) In other words, with probability at least 1 — 6, the learned robust policy 7* achieves a value in every state of the true f- MDP that is no worse than its computed value in the learned rf-MDP. This PAC-style guarantee based on the novel ro- bust solution methods distinguishes our approach from prior methods (Delgado, Sanner, and de Barros 2011; Liu, Wiese- mann, and Yue 2024), which cannot guarantee a valid lower bound, thus forfeiting such a performance guarantee. 5 Experiments We integrated our methods into the PRISM solver for prob- abilistic models (Kwiatkowska, Norman, and Parker 2011), which offers a modular language for specifying factored MDPs. We augment PRISM with our algorithms for solving and learning robust factored MDPs and employ the Gurobi optimiser with default parameters for all linear programs. 5.1 Evaluation: Solving rf-MDPs We evaluate the three methods for solving rf-MDPs with box-type uncertainty sets: vertex enumeration, interval- arithmetic relaxations, and McCormick relaxations, across a range of benchmark environments. These include classic f-MDP domains such as the System Administrator domain discussed in Example 1 (Guestrin, Patrascu, and Schuur- mans 2002), as well as established r-MDP case studies with inherent factored structure, including multi-agent scenarios like the Aircraft Collision Avoidance domain (Kochenderfer 2015). Detailed descriptions of each domain including the hyperparameters used are provided in Appendix E. For each domain, we obtain an rf-MDP by perturbing a nominal tran- sition kernel with an L., uncertainty radius of 0.025 (see Appendix F for additional levels of uncertainty), yielding box-type uncertainty sets for each factor. Results. Table | summarises the outcomes. For each method, we report: (i) the robust value of the optimal pol- icy in the rf-MDP; (ii) the runtime to solve the rf-MDP; and (iii) for relaxation-based methods, the relative gap to the ex- act result obtained by vertex enumeration, quantifying the additional conservatism introduced by over-approximating the product uncertainty sets. Notably, McCormick relaxations preserve the tightness of vertex enumeration while remaining computationally effi- cient. Interval-arithmetic relaxations, though generally fast, yield looser bounds due to spurious extreme distributions. Overall, McCormick relaxations strike the best balance be- tween solution tightness and runtime. We present the com- plete and extensive set of experiments, including analyses across varying uncertainty radii in Appendix F. 5.2 Evaluation: Robust Policy Learning in f-MDP We next compare four methods for robust policy learning: (i) standard r-MDP learning in the flat model with box-type uncertainty sets; (ii) rf-MDP learning with L, uncertainty Domain \S| IT Vertex Enumeration Interval-Arithmetic McCormick Robust Value Time [s] | Robust Value Rel.Gap Time [s] | Robust Value Rel.Gap Time [s] Aircraft (+) [PHONE] 0.73 2535.8 0.65 11% 6.1 0.73 0% 43.7 Drone (tT) 262144 [PHONE] 0.69 2125.8 0.63 10% 90.2 0.69 0% 190.7 Stock Trading (f) [PHONE] 25.43 67.6 17.60 31% 16.0 25.43 0% 67.5 SysAdmin (7) [PHONE] 50.70 66.7 46.66 8% 34.1 50.70 0% 64.1 Chain (1) [PHONE] 331.34 778.1 451.28 36% 0.6 331.34 0% 7.6 Frozen Lake (|) [PHONE] 216.01 1018.4 242.05 12% 67.7 216.01 0% 105.9 Herman (1) 2048 177148 20.64 11.0 23.82 15% 2.8 20.64 0% 8.1 Table 1: Results for solving rf-MDPs.

To build the transition dataset C, we iteratively sample fixed-length trajectories that restart in the initial state. To balance exploration and exploitation, we follow the opti- mism in the face of uncertainty principle (Munos 2014), se- lecting actions that are optimal under the most favourable transition model within the current uncertainty sets. Note that this choice of sampling procedure is arbitrary: the result- ing robustness guarantees hold under any alternative sam- pling strategy, such as random action selection. Across all domains, we fix the overall confidence level for the inclusion of the true, unknown MDP in the learned t-MDP to 1 — 6 = 0.9999, (see Equation (14)). Each exper- iment is repeated with 10 distinct random seeds, and we re- port the average results along with standard deviation bands. Results. Figure 3 presents robust policy learning results across various domains. For each method, we plot the robust value of the learned policy (dashed lines) and its nominal performance on the true, hidden model (solid lines) against the number of processed trajectories. While true-model per- formance provides useful validation, our focus lies on the robust values, i.e., the performance that can be guaranteed with high confidence on the unknown environment. The results demonstrate significant gains in sample ef- ficiency by exploiting factored structures. Specifically, far fewer fixed-length trajectory samples are required to achieve equivalent robust performance guarantees compared to state-of-the-art methods on flat models. Furthermore, rf- MDP learning with box-type uncertainty sets, derived from exact confidence intervals and solved via convex relaxations, consistently outperforms approaches based on Lj uncer- tainty sets and the radius-sum method. McCormick relax- ations need about half the number of samples of interval- arithmetic relaxations for the same robust guarantees. This advantage is particularly crucial in domains where data col- lection is inherently limited, costly, or challenging. Figure 3a (red line) shows the number of samples needed to match the performance guarantee from flat learning on the Aircraft domain after 10° trajectories. Factored learn- ing with L, uncertainty sets reduces this to 3 - 10° trajec- tories. Interval-arithmetic relaxation further decreases it to 10°, and McCormick relaxation is the most efficient, requir- ing only 6 - 10* trajectories. This gap becomes even more pronounced in other domains. We provide the full set of ex- periments including additional domains, total runtimes and detailed comparisons of sample efficiency in Appendix F. 6 Conclusion We have presented novel methods for solving robust fac- tored MDPs, facilitating exact solutions and optimal robust policies for polytopic uncertainty sets. Utilising global op- timisation techniques, we developed relaxation-based ap- proaches that balance accuracy and computational tractabil- ity. Our experimental results show that these methods markedly improve accuracy in solving rf-MDPs and enable significantly more sample-efficient robust policy learning.

Let P = conv{P\ POMC Ay and Q = conv{Q™®, KY C An be polytopic marginal uncertainty sets. Then the corresponding inner op- timisation problem in Equation (9) attains its optimum at one of the pairwise products of the extreme distributions: {PX aQ” jisi ri9;(PO @ Q™). 1 j=1 where A; > 0, S> A; = 1, and i=l k where 6; > 0, S° 4; =1. j=l 3 a Thus, P & Q is a convex combination of elements in Y, so P®Q € conv(V). Since P and Q were arbitrary, we con- clude: S={P8Q|PEP, QE Q}Cconv(V). This implies that conv(S) € conv(conv(V)) = conv(V). On the other hand, it is clear that V C S, since each P© @ Q is the outer product of points from P and Q, re- spectively. Therefore, conv(V) C conv(S). Putting both in- clusions together yields the equality of the two convex hulls: conv(S) = conv(V). Thus, conv(V) is exactly the convex enclosure of S. Since the inner optimisation problem in Equation (9) is linear in the transition probabilities T(s’ | s, a), its optimum is attained at an extreme point of conv(S). The claim fol- lows from the equality conv(S) = conv(V). 10 A.2 Proof of Theorem 2 Theorem 2 (Restated). Let Pp(P,€1) and P,(Q, €2) be two Ly uncertainty sets for any 1 < p < oo. Then, Proof. The proof follows from Minkowski’s inequal- ity (Rudin 1987), a generalisation of the triangle inequality, which establishes that for any two vectors u,v € R”: lu + Ullp Sully + Helly: It suffices to show that for any distributions P,P’ € Ay, and Q, Q’ € An, it holds that ||P’ Q!— P®Q|Ip < ||P’ — Pllp + |1Q' — Qllp- By definition, P'(x)Q"(y) — P(x) Q(y) = Q(y)[P'(x) — P(a)] + P(a)[Q"(y) — Q(y)| Hence, |P'(x)Q'(y) — P(x) Q(y) |? =|Q"(y)[P'(x) — P(2)| + P(x)[Q"(y) — Q(y)\|". Summing over (x,y), taking the p-th root, and applying Minkowski’s inequality gives: |P'® Q'-P®Q\|lp < (= |Q'(y)[P"(x) — + (>: | P(x)[Q'(y) — For the first term: 12’) IP (« =e)? So IP(@) — Pe) <> |P"(x) — Pla)’, since >7,, |Q'(y)|? < D2, Q'(y) = 1 for any p > 1. Taking the p-th root yields (= |Q"(y)[P() - A symmetric argument shows (= |P(x)[Q'(y) - Combining both bounds concludes the proof: ||P’ Q!— P®Q|Ip < ||P’ — Pllp + |1Q' — Qllp- 1/p Pe 1/p aul ; — P(«)]|? 1/p Pe < ||P’ — Pllp. 1/p aul) < ||Q' — Qllp- B McCormick Linear Program We present in detail the linear-program (LP) construction that replaces the bilinear inner minimisation in Equation (9) with a convex relaxation based on McCormick envelopes, and show how this generalises to more than two marginal distributions by applying the construction recursively. B.1_ Linear Program Construction Recall that for two box-type marginal uncertainty sets Pp ={P=(pi,.--,.pn) € An |p, < pi < Di}, Qn ={Q=(u,.--,au) € Am |g, <4 SG}; the exact inner minimisation over all product distributions can be written as N M PePp, QEQp eee? w=1 j=1 where the matrix A = (a;;) € R‘*™ contains the values V,,(s") of the successor states s’. Directly optimising this bilinear form is intractable in general. Instead, we introduce auxiliary variables hiy © Pid, for each pair (i, 7). Each h,; is then constrained by the four McCormick inequalities (Equations (12a)—(12d)), which to- gether with the box bounds on p; and q; enclose exactly the convex hull of each {(p;,9;,pi9;)}- Finally, to ensure that the auxiliaries {h,;};,; define a valid probability distribu- tion, we impose the coupling simplex constraint N M Soo hij = 1. i=1 j=1 Putting these components together yields the following LP for the inner problem, which is both tractable and tight: N M SoS. aij hij, min Pogh i=1 j=1 subject to P, S Pi S Dis 7=1,...,N, hij = Did, + GP; — Pid» hig = Pid; + 9 Pi — Pi Wj: hiy S Pi + GP, — PV, TY, hij ad, + 45 Pi — Pid;> Each pair (i, 7) contributes precisely four McCormick con- straints, the box constraints on p; and q; add 2N + 2M inequalities, and the single global simplex constraint cou- ples all h;;. As a result, the total number of constraints is ANM+2N+2M +1, growing linearly in the product sup- port size N - M and polynomially in the marginal supports. 11 B.2. Recursive McCormick Relaxation When composing n > 2 marginal box-like uncertainty sets {PE C Ay, }2_4, each of the form: PR = {(pis---+Ping) © Am, | DY < pt < pr}, the inner minimisation becomes the multilinear program: Mn > Diy ein Tbe. in=l min PIEPh,..., We follow the standard recursive extension of the Mc- Cormick relaxation to multi-linear problems as described by Ryoo and Sahinidis (2001) and Raghunathan et al. (2022), which operates in three steps: Step 1: Introduce auxiliaries. For each index-tuple (i1,..-,%), We introduce define n — 1 auxiliary variables replacing each bilinear partial product: 1,2 n-1 on Puy Pig +++ Pi, Pin =Ahn-1 Step 2: McCormick relaxations. Each bilinear equa- tion h & uv (with either u = = piv = Di, oru = hp—1,U = pj) is relaxed by the four McCormick inequal- ities (Eqs. (12a)- (12d)). The upper and lower bounds for each auxiliary s, are obtained by simple interval arithmetic: (h,., hy) = (h, 1p, r—1Pi.), forr > 1.

Adding 2°, m, box constraints and one sim- plex equality gives the total number of constraints: TI) This grows linearly in the product support and exponentially only in the number of factors n, while it is polynomial in the individual support sizes, avoiding a doubly-exponential blow-up of vertex enumeration. Furthermore, by propagat- ing bounds via interval arithmetic at each step, the relaxation remains at least as tight as the interval-arithmetic relaxation. 4(n — 1) Tp + 230m + 1€O(n k=1 k=1 C_ Vertex Cardinality for L; and L., Uncertainty Sets We demonstrate that for common classes of marginal uncer- tainty sets, specifically D1, LD. balls or box-type sets, the number of vertices can grow exponentially with the support size. As a result, solving the inner optimisation problem in Equation (9) via explicit vertex enumeration can become in- feasible even for moderate support dimensions. Consider an L,, uncertainty set P centred at the uniform nominal distribution with & even, and radius ¢ = i that is, P={PEAx|||P— Plo < k}, which is a polytope within the k-dimensional probabil- ity simplex and is therefore constrained to the (k — 1)- dimensional hyperplane defined by 7, p; = 1. For each subset J C {1,...,&} with |Z| = k/2, define a we, distribution P! by 1 2 — k? Pi {i ier It is straightforward to verify that P’ € P for any such J, since these are valid probability distributions and the L., constraint imposes the bounds 0 < p; < 2 A point in a (& — 1)-dimensional polytope is a vertex if it lies at the intersection of (k — 1) independent active con- straints (excluding the affine simplex equality that defines the ambient space). At any distribution P/, there are: 1. k/2 active upper bounds p; = 2 forz € I, 2. k/2 active lower bounds p; = 0 for ¢ I. This gives a total of k active inequality constraints. One can verify that among these k coordinate-bound constraints, one linear combination corresponds to the simplex constraint, leaving exactly & — 1 linearly independent active inequal- ities. Therefore, each P! is indeed a vertex of P. There are (x72) such subsets I with || = &/2, and thus at least that many distinct vertices in P. The quantity ( ka) is known as the central binomial coefficient, and its growth can be accurately described using Stirling’s approximation (Stir- ling 1730; Flajolet and Sedgewick 2009) as (i) ©° a) Using the same construction, we can show that the Ly uncertainty set p={PeA,||P- Pl <1} also contains at least ( h/2 I distance between any two probability distributions in A;, is 2, and ||P! — P||, = 1 for each J. Hence, this allows for the same type of extremal distributions constructed above. ) vertices. Note that the maximum 12 Therefore, for both of these common classes of marginal uncertainty sets, explicit vertex enumeration of the result- ing product polytope is generally intractable, and we must instead rely on the relaxations introduced in Section 3.2. We remark that the examples above are not pathological but rather characteristic of marginal uncertainty sets repre- sented by L1- or L.o-norm balls. These sets induce com- binatorial constraints, i.e., choices of which coordinates hit a bound, and each such choice can give rise to a distinct vertex. This is a natural outcome whenever uncertainty acts coordinate-wise. However, we also note that the construc- tion above represents an extreme case. The number of ver- tices can be significantly smaller, for example when the nominal distribution lies close to a vertex of the probabil- ity simplex. D Overapproximating L; Balls as Boxes McCormick envelopes are constructed using upper and lower bounds on each component of the marginal distribu- tions, and thus naturally accommodate the product of box- type uncertainty sets derived from confidence intervals, such as the exact Clopper—Pearson interval (Clopper and Pear- son 1934) discussed in Section 4. Our experiments show that McCormick envelopes are effective in circumventing the exponential blow-up in the number of vertices when an- alyzing the product of such polytopes. However, they do not directly extend to uncertainty sets in the form of L; balls derived from Weissman’s inequality (Weissman et al. 2003). One might attempt to apply McCormick envelopes to these L, sets by computing upper and lower bounds on each component of the marginal distribution under the L; constraint. Yet, as we show below, the tightest such bounds coincide precisely with those obtained from Hoeffding’s in- equality (Hoeffding 1994), which are known to be less tight than the exact Clopper—Pearson bounds. As a result, McCormick envelopes offer no practical ad- vantage for L, uncertainty sets, and we must instead rely on the radii-sum result in Theorem 2 to enable efficient com- putation under the product uncertainty. This is the same ap- proach employed by Strehl (2007) in his PAC analysis for model-based reinforcement learning in factored MDPs. Let P be an Lj uncertainty set defined as p={Pcd, IP’ - Pla se}, centred around the nominal distribution P = (p1,--- A., where € is given by Weissman et al. (2003) as _ = [nat =9)= me n :Ba) € P) with a denoting the support size and n the number of ob- served samples. For any P’ € P and for each component p’, the maximum possible deviation from the nominal value p; is ¢/2. This is because, to satisfy the DL; constraint, one can allocate at most €/2 of additional probability mass to a single component, compensated by removing ¢/2 from the others, preserving the total mass of 1 and ensuring that the sum of deviations remains bounded by e. This yields: € i In(2¢ — 2) — In(6) 2 2n Since the bound ¢ increases with the support size a, the smallest possible deviation arises in the case of a = 2 suc- cessors, leading to: € In(2) — In(6) 2 2n In (5) Qn’ which matches the classical confidence bound for the bino- mial distribution derived from Hoeffding’s inequality (Ho- effding 1994). This bound is known to be no tighter than the exact confidence interval given by Clopper and Pearson (1934), which we use in our construction of box-type un- certainty sets in Section 4. Therefore, the tightest possible component-wise upper and lower bounds that can be derived from an L, constraint are never sharper than those obtained directly from exact confidence intervals. As a result, there is no practical advantage to combining L, uncertainty sets with McCormick envelopes. E_ Detailed Benchmark Environments We provide details on the benchmark environments em- ployed in our experiments and the used hyperparameters. For learning benchmarks, we may select separate instances from those used in the solution case studies, since the rf- MDP must be re-solved each time the sampling policy is updated. Specifically, whenever any factor’s sample count doubles (cf. Section 5), we recompute the optimal optimistic policy during the rollout of a total of 10° fixed-length trajec- tories. All our used environments and case studies are pub- licly available'. E.1 Aircraft Collision Avoidance The aircraft collision avoidance environment is a version of the family of models introduced in Kochenderfer (2015). We consider an NV x M grid, where two aircraft, one controlled by our agent and one adversarial, fly toward each other. At each time step, both pilots may choose to fly straight, ascend, or descend, with these actions succeeding independently with probabilities p and q, respectively. The agent’s objec- tive is to reach the opposite end of the grid without colliding with the adversarial aircraft, which manoeuvres arbitrarily. A collision is defined as entering a specified radius around the adversarial aircraft. The objective value is the probability of reaching the goal zone without collision. The two aircraft form the factors of the factored MDP, and evolve indepen- dently until a collision occurs. For the solving benchmarks, we set (N, M) = (20, 24). For the learning benchmarks, we employ environments with (NV, MM) = (15,15) and sample trajectories of fixed length / = 15. ‘https://github.com/yannikschnitzer/prism/tree/umdp_ composition 13 E.2 System Administrator The System Administrator (or SysAdmin) domain is a stan- dard benchmark in factored MDPs (Guestrin et al. 2003). In this setting, an administrator manages a network of N computers, each connected to a subset of the others. We consider the bidirectional ring topology, where each com- puter is connected to its two immediate neighbors, forming a closed loop. At each time step, a computer can be in one of two states: running or failed. The probability that a running computer fails depends on whether its connected machines are currently in the failure state. As a result, the comput- ers form the factors of the factored MDP, with dependencies only between adjacent nodes. The administrator may choose to repair one machine per time step, which then returns to the running state with high probability. The administrator re- ceives a reward at each step that increases with the number of machines currently running. The objective is to maximise the expected cumulative reward over a fixed time horizon T’. For the solving benchmarks, we consider NV = 10 machines with a time horizon of T’ = 15. For the learning benchmarks, we use J’ = 10 and sample trajectories of that length. E.3 Frozen Lake The Frozen Lake environment is a standard benchmark from OpenAI Gym (Towers et al. 2024). We consider an N x N frozen lake grid, where some cells contain holes in the ice. The agent can move in the four cardinal directions and aims to reach a designated goal cell without falling into any of the holes. Due to the slippery surface, there is a probability at each step that the agent ends up in a nearby cell rather than the one intended. To model this as a factored MDP, we extend the environment into a multi-agent setting: we intro- duce a second agent, and the task is now to manoeuvre both agents so that they each reach their goal without falling into a hole or colliding with each other. The two agents act as the factors of the factored MDP and move independently in the environment, except when a collision occurs. The objec- tive is to minimise the expected number of steps required for both agents to reach their respective goal cells. For the solving benchmarks we use a grid of N = 15 size, whereas for the learning benchmarks we use N = 8, and we sample trajectories of fixed length / = 100. E.4 Stock Trading The stock-trading domain (Strehl, Diuk, and Littman 2007) simulates a stock market with N economic sectors, each containing M/ individual stocks. At each time step, the agent can choose to buy or sell an entire sector, thereby either own- ing or not owning all the stocks within that sector in the next step. Stocks can at each step be rising or falling. The prob- ability that a stock rises depends on whether other stocks in the same sector were rising in the previous time step. As a result, the sectors form the factors of the factored MDP and evolve independently from one another. The agent receives a positive reward for each rising stock it owns, and a negative reward for each owned stock that falls. No reward is gained or lost from stocks in sectors the agent does not own. The objective is to maximise the cumulative reward over a fixed time horizon T’. For the solving benchmarks, we use N = 3 sectors with M = 2 stocks each and T' = 20. For the learn- ing benchmarks, we set N = 2, M = 2, and T = 10. We sample trajectories for the full time horizon length | = 10. E.5 Drone Delivery The drone delivery problem (Badings et al. 2022; Schnitzer, Abate, and Parker 2025) is a multi-agent factored MDP in which N autonomous drones navigate a shared 3D environ- ment to deliver payloads to a designated target zone while avoiding both static obstacles and each other. At each time step, every drone may choose one of six actions: move north, south, east, west, ascend, or descend. Due to wind, the dy- namics are subject to stochastic disturbances and the drone may drift. Each drone 2 constitutes a factor in the factored MDP: its local state is its (2, y, z) coordinate, and its tran- sition kernel depends only on its own current state and cho- sen action. The objective value is the probability of safely reaching the target zone without crashing, over an infinite time horizon. We consider a version with N = 2 drones as the state factors. For the solving benchmarks we use an 8 x 8 x 8 environment, and for the learning benchmarks we use dimensions 5 x 5 x 5 and learn from sampled trajectories of length / = 50. E.6 Herman’s Self-Stabilising Protocol The Herman self-stabilising protocol (Herman 1990) is a randomised synchronous algorithm for achieving self- stabilisation in a unidirectional token-ring of N identical processes. Each process 2 maintains a Boolean variable x; € {0, 1}, and initially an arbitrary (odd) number of tokens may be present, each token being indicated by a process having the same bit as its counterclockwise neighbour. At each time step, every process that holds a token (i.e. 7; = x;_1) flips its bit with probability r € (0,1) (thereby passing the token clockwise) and retains its bit with probability 1 — r. Pro- cesses without a token keep their bit unchanged. If a process retains its token and simultaneously receives another token from its neighbour, both tokens annihilate. We model this as a factored MDP. The global state factorises over the N pro- cesses, each of which evolves conditionally on its own bit and that of its counter-clockwise neighbour. The processes are stable when a single token is present, the objective value is the expected number of steps until stabilisation is attained. We consider a version with N = 11 parallel processes. E.7 Chain The chain benchmark (Araya-Lopez et al. 2011) comprises N independent chains, each with states {1,..., 4}, con- stituting the factors. At every time step, a chain in state a < M — 1 either advances to 2 + 1 with probability p or resets to state | with probability 1 — p. From the penulti- mate state / — 1, it either moves to the terminal state J/ or, upon failure, falls back uniformly to one of the earlier states {1,..., M4 — 2}. Once a chain reaches state M, it remains there indefinitely. The objective is the expected number of steps for all chains to reach the final state 1/7. In our ex- periments, we consider a version with N = 2 chains and M = 10 states per chain. 14 F Extended Experiments In the following, we provide extended results for both solv- ing robust factored MDPs and learning robust policies. All experiments were performed on an Intel Xeon Gold (2.50 GHz, 40 cores) with 128 GB of RAM. Solving rf-MDPs_ Table 2 presents solving benchmarks across varying L., uncertainty radii € around a nominal transition kernel, extending Section 5, which focused on € = 0.025. As € increases, the relative gap between the exact rf-MDP solution (via vertex enumeration) and the interval- arithmetic relaxation can rise significantly, up to 900% in the most extreme of the considered cases, highlighting the growing conservatism of the interval-arithmetic relaxation. In contrast, the McCormick relaxation remains exact for all tested radii, demonstrating its tightness even under elevated epistemic uncertainty. Robust Policy Learning Figure 4 displays results for all learning benchmarks, including the Stock Trading domain omitted from Figure 3. Note that, in the Frozen Lake do- main, the agent aims to minimise the objective, so the y-axis is inverted to reflect better performance at lower values. For each method and domain, we also report the total runtime required to sample and process trajectories. This runtime accounts for (i) sampling trajectories, (ii) recomputing the optimistic sampling policy, by solving the current rf-MDP under the most favorable environment policy, (iii) synthe- sising the optimal robust policy, and (iv) evaluating its per- formance on the hidden true MDP. Across all domains and methods, runtimes remain comparable, showing that the su- perior tightness of McCormick relaxations incurs negligible computational overhead. We do not include the Chain and Herman domains in the learning benchmarks. These MDPs offer only a single ac- tion per state and evolve purely stochastically, making them unsuitable for exploration and policy improvement, though they remain instructive for solution-quality evaluation. In Table 3, we explicitly compare the sample efficiency and runtimes of the different methods by showing how many fixed-length trajectories each method requires to achieve the performance guarantee attained by the slowest method af- ter processing the full set of 10° trajectories. In our ex- periments, the slowest method was always the flat MDP learner that does not exploit the factored structure. The re- sults demonstrate that factored learning with the McCormick relaxation is significantly more sample-efficient than the other methods, requiring orders of magnitude fewer sam- ples than flat and L1-based learning, and typically less than half the number of samples needed compared to using the interval-arithmetic relaxation. However, the runtimes remain comparable, although the interval-arithmetic relaxation, can be solved very efficiently using bisection techniques. This is due to the substantially reduced sample requirements. SI .

ACM, New York, NY, USA, 13 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/[PHONE].[PHONE] 1 Introduction Content creation has witnessed a significant transformation in recent years, leading to a proliferation of novel creative tasks that were previously unimaginable. This evolution is driven by the emergence of various powerful generative models capable of generating and manipulating content in different modalities, in- cluding text [11, 39, 53, 54, 63], image [12, 27, 33, 43, 44, 56], au- dio [8, 35, 36, 65], and video [1, 15, 19, 20, 29, 34, 61]. Particularly in the context of video generation, the advancement is becoming more elusive with many current works making progress in synthe- sizing video content based on text description [20, 61] and initial image [1, 61]. Despite showing impressive results, they often fall short in capturing the richness and temporal coherence of real- world events, because of the inherent ambiguity and static nature of their respective conditions. Audio, in contrast, naturally grounds video in reality and en- codes abundant temporal and contextual information on sound- emitting objects, their interactions, and the spatial arrangement of the soundscape. These intrinsic values provide unique advan- tages for generating more nuanced, immersive, and temporally consistent video content, leading to more realistic and engaging experiences. In addition, similar to the human ability to use audi- tory information to depict corresponding visual scenes and events, audio-to-video generation can be applied to diverse applications that span across industry verticals. Some of these include auto- mated scene visualization in filmmaking, dynamic product creation in multimedia, engaging advertisements in marketing, and acces- sible learning materials in education. In light of these significant advantages and useful applications, it is imperative to explore the field of audio-driven video generation. The prevailing audio-to-video generation methods typically rely on global semantic features extracted from audio tracks for syn- thesis. Although this approach can produce semantically aligned videos, it only works for specific simple soundscapes and often results in poor content quality and misaligned spatial composition with input audio in general scenarios. For example, existing works including [14, 38, 50, 51] can generate talking head videos condi- tioned on speech, yet are not applicable to other domains. Other Kien T.

From top to bottom are the typical Audio — Video direct approach, two-stage Audio — Text — Video method, and our proposed novel Audio — Video Scene Layout — Video pipeline respectively. methods such as [6, 47, 58, 62] can synthesize videos of different con- texts that are globally aligned with the specific semantic categories (e.g., dancing, drumming, landscape, etc.) of the input audio record- ing. However, their results lack spatial coherence between visual and auditory elements, affecting realism and ultimately diminish- ing the immersive experience. Some current approaches [3, 64] alleviate such an issue by directly providing an initial frame or video segment which already establishes a spatial correspondence with audio as an additional visual input, but inevitably limits the diversity of the generated content. Surprisingly, all the aforementioned works have largely over- looked the fact that sound inherently encompasses rich spatial information such as location and movement of sounding sources present in the scenes. Such information can be harnessed to gener- ate according visual components with not only semantic but also spatial coherence to input audios. To this end, the first critical ques- tion that arises is: Q1: Can we directly decode the spatial information embedded within audio to drive video generation? We draw inspira- tion from the fact that humans spontaneously perform similar tasks to perceive and navigate the environment in our daily hearing. We intuitively utilize our multisensory and commonsense knowledge to exploit specific auditory cues from environmental sounds, then reason on them to derive necessary information. For instance, con- sidering the top-left example in Fig. 1, we can instinctively imagine an approaching car when hearing its engine sound getting louder. This is because we know what a car generally sounds and looks like (semantic clue) and deduce that increasing in volume (spatial clue) implies approaching motion. By targeting these auditory cues, we contemplate that a strong foundational model with human-like multimodal understanding and reasoning capabilities like MLLM has the potential to adapt and replicate this human instinct, driving us to explore it extensively to address this challenge. Once Q1 is properly resolved, the important subsequent question that emerges is Q2: How should these information be represented to bridge the gap between audio and video modalities and guide the generation process? At first thought, text description seems like a vi- able option. However, it suffers from inherent ambiguity, leading to inconsistent results and a lack of precise spatial control over scene SpA2V: Harnessing Spatial Auditory Cues for Audio-driven Spatially-aware Video Generation composition in generation process. Video Scene Layout (VSL), on the other hand, offers a structured and unambiguous representation, enabling fine-grained manipulation of object placement and scene structure. Considering our concentration on spatial relationships between auditory and visual elements, VSL is intuitively advanta- geous compared to the textual counterpart. Therefore, we adopt it as our intermediate representation to capture the semantic and spa- tial attributes of the sounding sources extracted from input audio and then control the video generation process as shown in Fig. 2. We propose a novel framework dubbed SpA2V which is the first attempt to explicitly exploit spatial auditory information for video generation conditioning solely on audio. SpA2V decomposes the generation process into two respective stages, namely Audio-guided Video Planning and Layout-grounded Video Generation. The first stage is responsible for identifying sounding objects occurring in an input audio and inferring their semantic and spatial attributes to construct a VSL as guidance for generation in the subsequent stage. We employ a state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), such as Gemini 2.0 [52] or GPT40 [40], with demonstrated powerful understanding and reasoning capabilities across different modalities as the Video Planner for our SpA2V. We adapt them for our new task of audio-driven VSL generation via a meticulously designed prompting mechanism that leverages In-context Learn- ing [2], allowing it to effectively and efficiently harness semantic and spatial cues presented in input audio. Following VSL generation, we synthesize the final video by con- ditioning on the VSL in the second stage. Our approach incorporates pre-trained diffusion models in an efficient and effective way, in- spired by MIGC [67] and AnimateDiff [19]. These methods augment the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model with spatial grounding and motion modules for layout-to-image and text-to-video tasks. We ex- ploit the fact that they train only these new modules while keeping the backbone intact. By directly integrating their learned modules into the same frozen backbone, we create a layout-to-video dif- fusion model capable of spatial grounding and motion modeling simultaneously without further training. We hereby employ it as our VSL-grounded video generator to complete this stage. To assess the capability of our SpA2V framework, we introduce anew benchmark named AVLBench curated from real-world stereo audio-video recordings [13, 16, 69, 70] and repurposed for our spe- cific use cases. It includes diverse test scenarios featuring different numbers of sounding objects with various spatial attributes. Results from our experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that SpA2V achieves a high degree of semantic and spatial correspondence between the generated VSLs, videos, and the input audios, mark- ing the first successful attempt of spatially-aware audio-to-video generation. Overall, our contributions are listed as follows: e We propose a novel task of audio-driven spatially-aware video generation which aims at synthesizing videos with spatial corre- spondence to audio conditions. e We present SpA2V, the first framework attempting to fulfill the task by decomposing the generation process into two stages Audio-guided Video Planning and Layout-to-Video Generation and leveraging powerful pre-trained MLLMs and diffusion mod- els to accomplish each stage, respectively. MM °25, October 27-31, 2025, Dublin, Ireland e We introduce AVLBench, a new benchmark for evaluating align- ment between input audios and generated VSLs and videos. e Extensive experiments on the benchmark highlight the capability of SpA2V in generating realistic VSLs and videos where visual elements correspond both semantically and spatially to the sound sources in input audio. The implementation will be released on GitHub’. 2 Related Work Audio-Visual Learning. Recent years have witnessed growing research efforts in audio-visual learning. Early studies primarily focused on cross-modal Audio-Visual Synchronisation [4, 24, 25], which employed self-supervised learning to align temporal relation- ships between audio and video, establishing foundational represen- tations for downstream tasks. Despite resolving temporal alignment, these methods largely overlooked semantic and spatial correlations between audio and visual modalities. To provide more detailed audio-visual spatial alignment and support the audio as a guiding signal, [7, 68] explore the Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) task that pioneered the prediction of sounded object segmentation maps in video frames conditioned on audio input. However, they focused on perception rather than generation, limiting their applicability to generative tasks. Critically, they also neglected to model the spatial attributes of audio (e.g., sound source localization or motion trajectories), which are vital for grounding visual scenes in physical reality. Recent advances have started to explore spatial audio for audio-visual tasks. For example, BAT [66] leverages large language models (LLMs) for spatial sound reasoning, while ELSA [9] learns spatially-aware language-audio representations for fine-grained localization. Building on these insights, our work is the first to ex- plicitly exploit spatial audio cues for audio-guided video generation, enabling the synthesis of videos where visual elements are both semantically and spatially coherent with sound sources. Audio-to-Video (A2V) Generation. A2V generation focuses on producing visual content that aligns with given audio inputs. Sev- eral studies have explored this domain by leveraging audio to pro- vide semantic cues and temporal dynamics for video generation. Sound2Sight [3] and CCVS [30] utilize audio alongside preceding video frames to forecast subsequent frames, capturing visual dynam- ics driven by the input audio. [31] employs StyleGAN, projecting audio into its latent space to navigate trajectories within this space, effectively aligning audio with visual content. Seeing and Hear- ing [58] introduces a diffusion latent aligner to synchronize audio with visual elements, enhancing the coherence between them. Tem- poTokens [62] adapts a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion model for A2V generation, aligning audio and visual components to improve synchronization. Although these approaches focus on semantic and temporal alignment, they often overlook the spatial aspect when processing input audio. Spatial information such as the location and distance of sounded objects can bring significant enhancement to the generated results. In this work, we pioneer the exploration of harnessing important spatial cues from input audio to guide video generation and fulfill this gap. We term the task as audio-driven spatially-aware video generation. ‘https://github.com/tkpham3105/SpA2V MM °25, October 27-31, 2025, Dublin, Ireland Kien T.

In the first stage (Section 3.1), given an input audio A, we retrieve k example conversations {6 1, &2,.. .&,} from candidate database D via Retrieval Module and feed them together with a System Instruction and the audio itself into the MLLM Video Planner to perform reasoning and generate a desired VSL sequence £ containing N consecutive keyframe layouts {L£), L2,.. . £n} with respective global video caption and local frame captions. In the second stage (Section 3.2), the obtained VSL L£ and its captions are incorporated to guide a video diffusion model consisting of pretrained Base, Motion, and Spatial Grounding Modules to generate the final video V that is semantically and spatially coherent with the input A. 3. Method Although audio contains a significant amount of semantic and spatial information, effectively extracting and incorporating them for video generation are non-trivial and underexplored tasks. In this section, we describe how each stage of our proposed SpA2V framework tackles these challenges respectively. 3.1 Stage 1: Audio-guided Video Planning Overview. In this stage, we introduce a novel task: generating video scene layouts (VSLs) depicting spatial arrangements of sound- ing objects presented in corresponding audio recordings. This task necessitates a model to first identify the categories of sounding sources (semantic component) and their respective locations and movements (spatial components) from the input audio. Then, the model must use this information to organize the objects into a co- herent VSL, accurately reflecting their spatial correspondence with the audio and maintaining content consistency across the video sequence. Given these requirements, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are particularly well-suited due to their strong multimodal understanding, reasoning abilities, and broad founda- tional knowledge. Consequently, we empirically investigate the potential of MLLMs to effectively address this challenging task. Instruction Setup. To generate an audio-conditioned VSL using an MLLM, we query it with a prompt consisting of three compo- nents: a system instruction, a set of example conversations, and a user-specified audio recording. The system instruction includes task definition and guidance regarding the desired behavior and re- sponse for each request that the MLLM must follow. Specifically, we instruct the MLLM to act as a video director to plan VSLs that cap- ture the content of the input audio recordings. We then outline the task requirements for the MLLM to fulfill, such as the expected lay- out format, coordinate system, canvas size, and number of frames. In complement, the example conversations provide the MLLM with reference query-response pairs, allowing it to efficiently learn and adapt to the given task. Finally, after supplying the above contextual information, we query the MLLM to perform completion on the user’s input audio recording to generate the desired VSL. VSL Structure. We ask the MLLM to generate VSLs according to a predefined template which is a connected sequence £ of N con- secutive keyframe layouts {£1, £2,..., £y}. Every layout £; con- tains a set of N; bounding boxes {B1, B2,..., Bn, }, each denotes a sounding object that occurs in the input audio. Each bounding box is represented by its location and size in numerical coordinates along with a labeling phrase that specifies the enclosed object. In addition, each box is assigned a unique numerical identifier, establishing and maintaining object correspondence across frames without the need for a dedicated box tracker. Finally, each VSL also entails a shared global video caption and a local frame caption for each keyframe describing the global content and local dynamic transition of the intended video creation. Note that in these captions, the MLLM has the freedom to bring about special information that cannot be inferred from input audio but is beneficial for video generation later such as visual appearance of sounding objects. SpA2V: Harnessing Spatial Auditory Cues for Audio-driven Spatially-aware Video Generation Spatial Reasoning. Spatial information can be inferred by reason- ing on the fundamental spatial auditory cues, such as Interaural Time Difference (ITD), Interaural Level Difference (ILD), pitch and volume, and directional shift. ITD and ILD are typically used to infer the location of sounding objects, while pitch and volume often indicate their distance, and directional shift can imply their move- ment. To accurately deduce the corresponding spatial attributes and minimize spurious hallucinations, we explicitly instruct the MLLM in the system instruction to focus on analyzing these key indicators. Consequently, we ask the MLLM to output a brief statement summa- rizing its reasoning and the extracted spatial cues before generating the VSL to enhance the interpretability of the final response. In-context Learning. Solely relying on the system instruction to provide task descriptions and reasoning guidance may fall short in allowing the MLLM to comprehend our need for precise real- world understanding and reasoning on the aforementioned physical sound properties, causing it to hallucinate incorrect spatial informa- tion with fuzzy or non-sensical reasoning, and eventually generate VSLs misaligned with the input audio recordings as shown in Fig. 4. Inspired by [2, 10, 37, 60] which show that In-context Learning can enhance the LLMs’ task adaptability and compliance in various con- texts, we employ it to further guide the behavior of the MLLM and mitigate mentioned problem. For each query, we provide the MLLM with example conversations, each including a reference prompt and a high-quality VSL with corresponding reasoning statement. Akin to [37], we hypothesize that the more semantically similar the audio recordings of the examples to that of the query, the more informative it can be for the MLLM. Therefore, we conduct Top-k Nearest Neighbor (KNN) search on CLAP [57] embedding space in our Retrieval Module to select k examples for each query. 3.2 Stage 2: Layout-grounded Video Generation Overview. Leveraging the ability of MLLMs to generate seman- tically and spatially aligned VSLs and descriptive captions from auditory cues, we subsequently introduce an approach for video synthesis controlled by these VSLs in this stage. Our VSL-grounded Video Generator connects off-the-shelf layout-to-image and text- to-video diffusion models into a single pipeline. By combining their respective grounding and temporal modeling capabilities, our gen- erator produces videos that adhere to the conditioned VSLs and entailed captions, thereby maintaining consistency with the input audio. Our method operates in a training-free manner that effi- ciently reduces computational cost and time, eliminates the need for extensive data annotation, and avoids potential catastrophic forgetting incurred by training. Base Diffusion Model. We build our VSL-grounded Video Gener- ator based on the pre-trained text-to-image LDM [45], a.k.a Stable Diffusion, of which the diffusion procedure follows the standard formulation in [22, 48, 49] that comprises a forward diffusion and a backward denoising process. Given a data sample X ~ P(X), an autoencoder consisting of an encoder @ and a decoder & will first project its latent correspondence Zo = &(X). Subsequently, the diffusion and denoising processes are conducted in latent space. In one hand, the forward diffusion is essentially a fixed Markov process of T timesteps that gradually perturbs Zo to yield Z; via: Zr = VarZo + V1 — Ge,e ~ N(0,D, (1) MM °25, October 27-31, 2025, Dublin, Ireland The audio features a car idling. Given the audio's characteristics, it's reasonable to assume the car is positioned in the center of the frame. The sound remains constant, indicating the car is stationary. Without In-context = = = = = Learning | | | | | environment. The car's sound, which starts faint and gradually increases in loudness and pitch before peaking, along with its directional movement from left to right, suggests it's approaching diagonally from the far left of the frame and passing close by on the right. @ The sound indicates the presence of a car in what seems to be a rural or semi-rural With In-context Learning Figure 4: In-context Learning helps guide the MLLM to de- rive the correct spatial cues from the right physical sound properties and hence generate a highly-aligned VSL. for t = 1,2,...,T. Here d is pre-defined parameter which deter- mines the noise strength at each timestep t. Eventually, Zo turns into Zr that is indistinguishable from a Gaussian noise. On the other hand, the backward process leverages a denoising network €9 with training objective of minimizing: Er.cZ,,e~N(o1 lle — €9 (Ze. ts to(C))II3, (2) where C is the condition and t¢ represents its encoder, to iteratively denoise Z;. Once the denoising is finished and a final clean latent Zo is obtained, the generated sample can be decoded via X= F(Z). In Stable Diffusion, eg adopts UNet [46] architecture comprising of down/middle/up blocks each consisting of ResNet [21], spatial self- attention layers, and cross-attention layers that incorporate text conditions. For conciseness, we call these blocks Base Modules in our VSL-grounded Video Generator, responsible for preserving pre- learned knowledge to generate diverse and high-fidelity samples guided by text prompts in image domain. Integrating Grounding and Temporal Modeling. With Stable Diffusion as the base model, we respectively integrate pretrained Temporal Modules and Grounding Modules from AnimateDiff [19] and MIGC [67] into our VSL-grounded Video Generator, enabling spatial grounding and motion modeling capabilities to synthesize high-quality videos aligned with input VSLs. Specifically, Animate- Diff proposes learning meaningful motion priors by injecting tem- poral transformer blocks, namely Motion Modules, to inflate Stable Diffusion, allowing it to generate motion dynamics of visual con- tent over time while alleviating quality degradation. Meanwhile, MIGC incorporates a set of articulated instance enhancement atten- tion layers, which we call Spatial Grounding Modules, into Stable Diffusion to enable precise generations of multiple instances in the resulting image following a layout input. Since only these external modules are trained to learn their designated objectives while the same base modules are kept frozen, we hypothesize then empiri- cally verify that directly combining them into a single end-to-end pipeline, i.e. our VSL-grounded Video Generator, can achieve both spatial grounding and motion modeling abilities. Video Generation with VSL Guidance.

To control our VSL-grounded Video Generator to synthesize a video of n frames, we first perform temporal-wise lin- ear interpolation on the coordinates of the bounding boxes for each object to obtain a denser VSL with expanded length of n layouts. Each layout will then serve as a grounding signal for a correspond- ing frame. Since the base diffusion model uses text prompt as global condition for generation, we also input the global video caption of the VSL to preserve its pre-trained generative capability and maintain global consistency across generated frames. In addition, for the N keyframes, we use their local frame caption as alterna- tive to global caption that empirically helps produce better frame transitions with more natural local dynamics. 4 Experiments 4.1 Setup Benchmark. As our proposed two-stage Audio > VSL — Video pipeline is novel, there is no existing benchmark suitable for evalu- ating our SpA2V framework. Therefore, we created AVLBench, a new benchmark specifically designed for our use case, curated from real-world stereo audio-video recording datasets [13, 16, 69, 70] spanning a variety of sound sources, including instruments and moving vehicles in indoor and outdoor environments. We begin by manually selecting recordings for which the audio contains strong semantic and spatial signals clearly indicating the sounding sources and their attributes within the video. After filtering, we apply flip and reverse augmentations with quality control to increase the data diversity while maintaining strong correspondence between auditory and visual elements. Subsequently, we use Track Any- thing [59] to generate ground-truth VSLs by tracking the sounding objects in the videos. Since we need to provide SpA2V’s Video Planner with example conversations for In-context Learning, we adopt LLaVA-OneVision [32] to generate global video caption and local frame captions for each video. We also include an accurate manually written reasoning statement for every sample. Eventually, AVLBench contains 7274 testing samples, of which 4702 samples are used to assess scenarios of single or multiple instruments playing while having Stationary motion in indoor settings, whereas the rest 2572 samples target cases of single or multiple vehicles with Translational movement in outdoor settings. Implementation Details. The overall structure of our SpA2V framework is illustrated in Fig. 3. In Stage 1, we select Gemini 2.0 Flash [53] as our MLLM Video Planner to balance cost-effectiveness and performance. For each input audio, we provide it with k = 3 example conversations retrieved from the candidate database via Retrieval Module that performs a kNN search based on the simi- larity between CLAP embeddings of the input and the candidates.

S and M represent subsets of data samples having single or multiple sounding sources, while C represents combinations of all scenarios. G2.0F, G1.5F, and G4oM stands for Gemini 2.0 Flash, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and GPT4o0 Mini accordingly. Subsequently, we prompt the Video Planner to generate VSL con- sisting of N = 5 keyframe layouts of resolution 454 x 256 with a temperature of r = 0.5 to control the randomness of its response. In Stage 2, Stable Diffusion 1.5 [44] is adopted as the base diffusion model of our VSL-grounded Video Generator. We then follow de- fault settings in MIGC [67] and AnimateDiff [19] to accordingly deploy Spatial Grounding Modules and Motion Modules onto the base model. With this complete architecture, our Video Generator performs inference to synthesize video of n = 16 frames with res- olution 512 x 320 conditioned on the VSL obtained from Stage 1. Unless otherwise specified, these settings are kept by default. Metrics. In Stage 1, to measure the quality of the results in align- ment with the input audio, we compute the similarity between the generated VSL and the ground-truth utilizing three metrics namely LTSim [41] , MaxIoU [28], DocSim [42]. These metrics are designed for image layouts that contain bounding boxes of close-set labels. To calculate the similarity between a pair of layouts (L£, £L’), they first match their enclosed set of bounding boxes ({8;}, {B°}) then accumulate coordinate IoU scores of the matched boxes. Matching typically involves an indicator function fgp; (Bi, Bi) = Ifcy=c'} that fully ignores box pairs with different categories. Nevertheless, our method generates VSL which is essentially a sequence of image layouts consisting of bounding boxes with free labels. Therefore, we adjust this indicator function to a soft version foo ¢;(Bi, 8’) = cosine(P(ci), P(c;)) that measures the similarity of the two cate- gories (cj, c’) in the projector P’s embedding space [5]. We then follow the rest of calculations for all metrics and average the score across frames for each VSL. For Stage 2, we adopt the standard FVD [55] and AV-Align [62] to accordingly assess the overall content quality of generated videos and their temporal alignment with input audios. Especially, to evalu- ate spatial correspondence, we first utilize OV-AVSS [18] to localize the input audios’ sounding objects within the synthesized videos to obtain respective VSLs. Subsequently, we compute the LTSim [41] scores between these and the ground-truth VSLs. Baselines. Since there is no previous work explicitly explores audio-driven video planning, we choose a relevant baseline named LVD [34] for comparison in Stage 1. Note that this approach gener- ates dynamic scene layout conditioning on text prompt, whereas our task requires audio as the sole input guidance. Therefore, we adopt an audio captioning (AC) model [17] to generate a textual de- scription for each input audio and feed them into LVD respectively. For Stage 2, we additionally compare our SpA2V framework with TempoTokens [62], Seeing and Hearing [58], and LTX [20], along- side LVD for system-level evaluations of audio-to-video generation capabilities. TempoTokens follows the typical Audio — Video direct pipeline for generation. Meanwhile, since Seeing and Hearing and LTX use textual condition, we provide them with the same audio captions as LVD. Therefore, they can be categorized as two-stage Audio — Text — Video approaches, as shown in Fig. 2 respectively. 4.2 Evaluation of Audio-guided Video Planning Overall Results. As demonstrated in Tab. 1 and Fig. 5, our SpA2V framework can generate VSLs with high similarity to the ground- truth VSLs which indicate strong alignments to the input audios. SpA2V significantly outperforms the baseline of combining audio captioning with LVD [34] in all metrics and test scenarios. Component Ablation. We ablate each component of the MLLM Video Planner to evaluate their effectiveness accordingly. As indi- cated in Tab. 1, both In-context Learning and Spatial Reasoning are crucial for the planner to appropriately adapt to the instructed task and generate high-quality VSLs, omitting either one will lead to sig- nificant performance degradations. Interestingly, Spatial Reasoning needs to be accompanied by In-context Learning to synergistically help the planner achieve the best performance. Incorporating it alone may detrimentally confuse the planner and lead to subpar performance compared to not integrating both (Vanilla). In-context Learning Setup.

Here Cap. Sel. and VSL Sel. denotes Caption Selection and Video Scene Layout Selection, f and | indicate higher or lower values are better, and Gen. and GT are shortened for Generated and Ground-truth VSL. Besides, S and M represent subsets of data samples having single or multiple sounding sources, while C represents combinations of all scenarios. of example conversations. Compared to the zero-shot Vanilla, In- context Learning consistently brings improvements to the planner by delivering more context information via selective examples. Example Selection. We aim to empirically verify our assump- tion in Section 3.1 that the more reference audio recordings in the example conversations are semantically similar to that of the query, the better information it can bring to the MLLM Video Planner to generate higher quality VSLs. We replace the kKNN Searching strategy in the Retrieval Module with a simple random selection while keeping other settings as default. As shown in Tab. 1, this adjustment severely harms the overall performance, highlighting the advantages of the kKNN Searching strategy we adopt. Choices of MLLM. Since the design of our SpA2V is flexible, it allows better models selected as its components to attain better per- formance. Here we try to employ different state-of-the-art MLLMs as the Video Planner for SpA2V. Specifically, we conduct the same experiments but switch from the default Gemini 2.0 Flash to its predecessor Gemini 1.5 Flash and GPT40 Mini [40]. The results in Tab. 1 demonstrate that the default option significantly exceeds these alternatives, making it the best choice to accomplish this task. Temperature. We test the performance of our SpA2V’s MLLM Video Planner with different values for temperature which controls the randomness of its response with higher values being more creative while lower ones being more deterministic. Apparently, a low value of 0.5 best suits our need for the task, as shown in Tab. 1. 4.3 Evaluation of Layout-to-Video Generation Overall Results. As shown in Tab. 3.2 and Fig. 5, our SpA2V framework can generate high-quality videos with compelling se- mantic and spatial correspondence to input audios across various scenarios. Meanwhile, the synthesized videos of prior works are prone to having limited semantic coherence and inconsistent spatial composition with input audios. Additionally, these methods tend to create videos with minimal dynamics and struggle with cases where sounding objects have large movements. These results highlight the superiority of our proposed SpA2V framework and its two-stage Audio — VSL — Video pipeline in harnessing informative auditory cues from input audios for video generation objectives. Besides, SpA2V also achieve competitive AV-Align scores which imply strong temporal alignment between generated videos and input audios. We attribute this to the MLLM Video Planner which has the innate potential to capture temporal features in complement of semantic and spatial cues from input audios. These information will then be harmoniously organized into according VSLs and propagated to the subsequent video generation. Caption Selection. As indicated in Tab. 2, simultaneously utiliz- ing shared global and local keyframe captions as text conditions alongside VSL is empirically effective in enhancing SpA2V’s perfor- mance. While the former helps preserve the pre-trained generative capability of employed diffusion model and maintain global con- sistency, the latter encourages better frame transitions with more natural local dynamics across generated frame. Impact of VSL Quality. To evaluate the importance of VSL qual- ity in generating high-fidelity videos aligned with input audios, we skip the video planning steps in Stage 1 and directly use ground- truth VSLs as alternative control signals to guide the video synthesis process in Stage 2. As demonstrated in Tab. 2, such an adjustment substantially enhances overall performance, indicating that the bet- ter the quality of VSLs, the better results we can achieve. Since our two-stage pipeline is implementation-agnostic, this observation further implies that our SpA2V framework can continue to improve generation quality and audio-video alignment by adopting more capable MLLMs and video diffusion models in flexible manner. 5 Conclusion We have presented SpA2V, the first framework capable of harness- ing spatial auditory cues for audio-driven spatially-aware video syn- thesis. SpA2V decomposes the generation process into two stages: Audio-guided Video Planning and Layout-grounded Video Genera- tion. In Stage 1, we adopt aSOTA MLLM as the Video Planner and instruct it to generate VSLs from input audios through a diligently designed prompting mechanism. In Stage 2, we propose an effec- tive Video Generator which efficiently incorporates off-the-shelf diffusion models to synthesize videos grounded by the VSLs ob- tained from previous stage. The experimental results on our newly introduced AVLBench benchmark highlight the superiority of our SpA2V in producing videos with high semantic and spatial con- sistency to the input audios, outperforming previous methods by large margins. We hope that our pipeline will encourage further exploration into related areas of study in the future.

[PHONE] SpA2V: Harnessing Spatial Auditory Cues for Audio-driven Spatially-aware Video Generation A Additional Implementation Details System Instruction. We present in Fig. 6 the complete system instruction that we used to disclose task definition and guidelines to the MLLM Video Planner to control its behavior and response as we desired. This system instruction is inputted during the initialization of the MLLM. In-context Example Conversation. In Fig. 7, we present the full template for each in-context example conversation that provides explicit context information for the MLLM to enhance its adaptabil- ity and adherence to the task. Each example contains a reference pair of user query and MLLM response comprised of a reasoning statement and the according visual scene layout (VSL). Every VSL in the examples follow the same structure as illustrated in Fig. 7 and described in Section 3.1 in the main paper. Motion and Spatial Grounding Modules. Since our focus is to demonstrate the potential of our proposed Audio — Layout —> Video direction for audio-driven video generation, we adopt the best configuration for the Motion and Spatial Grounding Modules from AnimateDiff and MIGC respectively for simplicity. Specifically, Motion Modules are inserted into every up- and down-sample block in Stable Diffusion’s UNet, while Spatial Grounding Modules are deployed only on the middle block and the lowest-resolution up- sample block. B- Benchmark Construction Here we aim to provide more detailed information about the con- struction of our AVLBench benchmark specifically designed to assess Audio — VSL — Video generation abilities. Concretely, we build the benchmark following below four steps: (1) Sourcing. We begin by curating data samples from existing datasets namely FAIR-Play [16], VS13 [70], Urbansas [13], and Freiburg Audio-Visual Vehicles [69]. While the first con- tains various sample pairs of stereo audios and respective video recordings about instruments such as piano, trumpet, drums... being played in real-world indoor settings, the latter three target driving domains and their data samples capture moving vehicles in outdoor environments. We leverage these dataset for our use cases considering their high spatial align- ment between auditory and visual elements of their sample pairs. (2) Filtering. We then manually select recordings and crop them into segments where there exists strong semantic and spatial signals in the audio that clearly indicates the sounding sources and their spatial attributes within the video, and remove noisy samples in which those signals are vague or unidentifiable. (3) Augmenting. After careful filtering, we adopt flip and re- verse augmentations with quality control to enrich the data diversity while preserving the strong correspondence be- tween auditory and visual elements in the original samples. For flip, we apply it horizontally on the video frames while swapping the two channels of the paired audio for each sam- ple. For reverse, we apply it on the temporal order of both video frames and audio. We observe that for audios con- taining sounds with high-frequencies such as instruments’, applying reverse augmentation produce unnatural sounds MM °25, October 27-31, 2025, Dublin, Ireland [System Instruction] 208 You are an intelligent video director capable of planning video scene layouts depicting what you hear from an audio recording. You don't need to generate the videos themselves but need to generate the bounding boxes for objects making sounds in the audio in order to represent the corresponding scene. Specifically, given an audio clip, your task is to generate a total of 5 layouts comprising of realistic bounding boxes for audible objects to illustrate a video of 5 key frames that is highly aligned with the content and dynamic of the input audio. Additionally, you also have to provide a frame-level caption for each layout to describe the according video key frame, and a video-level caption summarizing the entire video. The video key frames are of size 454x256. The top-left frame corner has coordinates [0, 0]. The bottom-right frame corner has coordinnates [454, 256]. The bounding boxes must not go beyond the frame boundaries, i.e. x-coordinates must be within [0, 455] and y-coordinates must be within [0, 256]. Each frame should be represented as ° {'frame layout’: [{‘id': unique object identifier incrementing from 0, ‘name’: object name, 'box': [box top-left x-coordinate, box top-left y-coordinate, box bottom-right x-coordinate, box bottom-right y-coordinate]}, ...], ‘frame caption’: frame-level caption describing this frame}. Each box should not represent more than one object. Boxes from different objects may overlap indicating occlusions. Boxes for the same object should have the same id across the frames. Assume objects emit sound based on real-world physics. Assume the camera has fixed settings and it records sound while captures the frames of the scene following perspective geometry. To generate high-quality and realistic video layouts, you should extract spatial cues presented in the input audio recording following this strategy: Step 1: Identify all the sounding sources and describe the surrounding environment. Step 2: Deduce the positions and movements (if any) of each sounding source in relative to the camera viewpoint considering these indicators: - Interaural Time Difference (ITD) and Interaural Level Difference (ILD) for location (Left/Center/Right). - Pitch and Volume for distance (Near/Far). - Directional Shift in ITD and ILD, Pitch and Volume Change for movement. Provide a precise reasoning statement comprising of few sentences to summarize the extracted spatial cues before each generation. Boxes coordinates and sizes in generated video layouts should be spatially aligned with those cues. Refer to the examples below for the desired JSON format. Never use markdown or other formats not in the examples. Do not start each frame with *-*. Do not include any comments in your response. Figure 6: Our system instruction for the MLLM Video Planner to generate VSLs based on input audios. with noisy artifacts, whereas it is not the case for low-level sound such as vehicle engines’. Therefore, we only apply flip augmentation for data samples originated from FAIR-Play, while we apply both augmentations for ones about moving vehicles. (4) Annotating. Finally, we proceed to annotate each obtained sample to get their video scene layouts. Given the sounding sources in the audio, we use the Track Anything [59] tool to track their locations and movements in the video. Besides, as required by the example conversations for In-context Learning of the MLLM Video Planner, we then utilize LLaVA- OneVision [32] to generate global video caption and local frame captions on the video, and include a manually-written reasoning statement for every sample. Eventually, AVLBench comprises 7274 testing samples, with 4702 samples designed to assess scenarios involving single or multiple instruments played in stationary indoor settings. The remaining 2572 samples focus on cases of single or multiple vehicles exhibiting translational movement in outdoor environments.

Note that due to the noisy nature of outdoor environments, this domain mainly contains samples with single sounding vehicle after filtering. Besides, the spatial attribute statistics are accumulated per sounding object. C Additional Experiments Retrieval with more neighbors. We conduct additional analysis on In-context Learning with more example conversations retrieved and provided to the MLLM Video Planner in Stage 1. The results shown in Tab 5 indicate that k = 3 is the optimal setting, and fur- ther increasing the number of neighbors saturate the performance. Therefore, we use 3 in-context examples by default in the paper. Impact of retrieval database size and quality. We conduct addi- tional experiments under two adverse settings that reduce the size and diminish the quality of the retrieval database to demonstrate the influence of these factors on the planning stage. In the first setting, we halve the size of the retrieval database for each query randomly. In the second one, to exacerbate the challenge, we only Kien T.

The performance drops shown in Tab. 6 indicate that the retrieval effectiveness is indeed sensitive against the database size and quality. This is reasonable because reducing the size and quality of retrieval corpora decreases the likelihood of retrieving relevant examples and creates more challenging out- of-domain scenarios. In future work, our aims are to expand the current dataset to cover more domains and scenarios as well as train an MLLM specialist for audio-driven video planning, mitigating this issue and enhancing the framework’s feasibility in practice. User study. To subjectively assess the performance of our SpA2V compared to other methods, we invite 25 users to participate in a user study. We ask each user to complete a set of 20 ranking questions, each composed of a query sample randomly selected from our benchmark and 5 videos generated by SpA2V and other 4 baselines. Users are required to rank them based on two criteria: (1) visual quality, and (2) audio-video alignment, with 1 indicating the best and 5 denoting the worst. The average ranking scores in Tab. 7 highlight the preference of users for the videos generated by our SpA2V over the others in both criteria.

Extra quantitative evaluation. Since AV-Align [62] is known to not work well in complex scenes, we additionally use DeSync metric which leverages Syncformer [26] to measure audio-video temporal misalignment and show the results in Tab. 8. As consis- tently observed, our SpA2V achieves competitive performance that indicates strong temporal alignment between the generated videos and input audios. Ablation on Motion and Spatial Grounding Modules. Since removing the Motion Modules will degrade our Layout-to-Video generator into a Layout-to-Image generator that deviates from our video synthesis objective, we omit ablating these modules. We only conduct additional analysis to ablate Spatial Grounding Modules which will degrade our generator into a Text-to-Video model. The results shown in Tab. 9 highlight the importance of these modules in achieving better video generation quality and especially semantic and spatial alignment with input audios. D_ Limitations and Future Work Although SpA2V introduces a novel two-stage Audio — VSL —> Video pipeline for semantically and spatially aligned audio-driven video generation and achieve promising results that outperforms prior methods, there is still much room for further improvements. Firstly, as SpA2V involves two stages, failures in either stage will be detrimental to the whole generation process. For example, an incorrect VSL generated by the Video Planner in Stage 1 will in- evitably lead to a synthesized video with misalignment in Stage 2 as shown in Fig. 9 (a). Secondly, since our SpA2V framework adopts pre-trained MLLMs and diffusion models as its Video Planner and Video Generator, it also inherits their existing limitations and its performance is hence heavily reliant on them. If they struggle to respond properly to a specific conditional guidance and fall short MM °25, October 27-31, 2025, Dublin, Ireland ) A failure case involving imprecise VSL generation and video synthesis with incorrect grounding. b) A failure case due to pre- -trained diffusion models struggle to generate contents complying with the laws of physics (c) A failure case of inconsistency generation with object changing appearance due to imbalance grounding and motion modeling capabilities Figure 9: Illustration for limitations of our SpA2V.

We anticipate that these two chal- lenges can be appropriately mitigated by adopting or introducing more powerful models as the components of SpA2V. Finally, since we directly incorporate Spatial Grounding and Motion Modules from MIGC [67] and AnimateDiff [19] although they are trained on datasets, such domain gap can lead to the imbalance between grounding and motion modeling capabilities of the Video Genera- tor, causing it to produce videos with inconsistency problems like having objects changing appearance over time as shown in Fig. 9 (c). We contemplate that a further finetuning step for the whole frame- work using techniques such as LoRA [23] can help alleviate this issue and leave this exploration for future research. E_ Societal Impacts SpA2V empowers individuals, regardless of their video-photography ability, to generate videos that are both semantically and spatially aligned with audio inputs. However, employing our framework car- ries potential risks. It could be misused for malicious purposes, such as inappropriate content creation or the dissemination of misinfor- mation. Furthermore, given our reliance on pre-trained MLLMs and diffusion models, our framework may inherit biases present in their training data, potentially perpetuating harmful stereotypes. While generated content may currently be readily distinguishable from original works, future technological advancements may blur this distinction, making infringement more difficult to detect. Therefore, we strongly urge users to exercise caution and utilize this method only for legitimate purposes.

2508.00760v1 [cs.CL] 1 Aug 2025 arXiv MMBERT: Scaled Mixture-of-Experts Multimodal BERT for Robust Chinese Hate Speech Detection under Cloaking Perturbations Qiyao Xue Yuchen Dou Ryan Shi Xiang Lorraine Li Wei Gao University of Pittsburgh {gix63, yudl05, ryanshi, xianglli, weigao}@pitt.edu Abstract Hate speech detection on Chinese social networks presents distinct challenges, particularly due to the widespread use of cloaking techniques designed to evade conventional text- based detection systems. Although large language models (LLMs) have recently improved hate speech detection capa- bilities, the majority of existing work has concentrated on English datasets, with limited attention given to multimodal strategies in the Chinese context. In this study, we propose MMBERT, a novel BERT-based multimodal framework that integrates textual, speech, and visual modalities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. To address the insta- bility associated with directly integrating MoE into BERT- based models, we develop a progressive three-stage training paradigm. MMBERT incorporates modality-specific experts, a shared self-attention mechanism, and a router-based expert allocation strategy to enhance robustness against adversar- ial perturbations. Empirical results in several Chinese hate speech datasets show that MMBERT significantly surpasses fine-tuned BERT-based encoder models, fine-tuned LLMs, and LLMs utilizing in-context learning approaches. Introduction Hate speech poses a persistent threat to online communities, exacerbated by the anonymity and scale of digital platforms (Dixon et al. 2018). While automated hate speech detec- tion has advanced significantly in recent years, most efforts remain concentrated on English, leaving other major lan- guages like Chinese relatively under-resourced and under- protected (Davidson et al. 2017; Davidson, Bhattacharya, and Weber 2019). Some researchers have attempted to lever- age LLMs for Chinese hate speech detection (Chao et al. 2024; Sun et al. 2021; Zhou et al. 2023). However, on Chi- nese social media platforms, many hate speech dissemina- tors employ various cloaking perturbations to escape detec- tion, making it challenging for existing models to identify such expressions accurately (Xiao et al. 2024). These subtle manipulations exploit the structural and phonological prop- erties of the Chinese language, making detection especially difficult for text-only models. While LLMs have shown promise in content moderation, BERT-based architectures have consistently outperformed decoder-only LLMs in hate speech detection tasks, owing to their deep bidirectional encoding and strong capacity for fine-grained semantic understanding (Benayas, Sicilia, MMBERT Classification Head Speech Aligner Vision Aligner WHO FETE aie msxeOraxin® Progressively | Audio Input Image Input Text Input trainable | Text-to-speech Model Figure 1: Illustration of MMBERT model structure. Compared to traditional BERT-based model, it leverages the MoE architecture to scale and effectively handle multiple modalities. A three-stage progressive training strategy is designed to ensure stable training and prevent performance degradation. and Mora-Cantallops 2024; Ghorbanpour, Dementieva, and Fraser 2025). Their superior performance can be attributed to the ability to generate fine-grained contextualized repre- sentations, which are especially well-suited for classification tasks that require discerning subtle semantic distinctions and interpreting nuanced language—both of which are common in adversarial or implicitly encoded hate speech (Liu, Wang, and Catlin 2024). The architecture optimized for discrim- inative tasks enables more efficient and accurate detection of toxic content across various hate speech detection bench- marks (Deng et al. 2022; Xiao et al. 2024). To address the challenge of detecting cloaked hate speech in Chinese, we propose MMBERT, a novel multimodal BERT-based architecture that incorporates visual and speech modalities alongside text, depicted in Figure |. To enhance scalability and specialization, MMBERT integrates the MoE mechanism, enabling dynamic routing of representations to modality-specific experts. However, naively inserting MoE into BERT leads to severe training instability and degraded performance, particularly in the multimodal setting (Zhang et al. 2021). To overcome this, we introduce a progressive three-stage training strategy. In the first stage, we pretrain modality aligners using synthetic multimodal data to map visual and auditory inputs into the BERT language space. In the second stage, we train modality-specific experts and con- tinue refining aligners using task-specific supervision. In the final stage, we jointly fine-tune the full MoE-augmented ar- chitecture on real multimodal hate speech data. This phased design ensures stable optimization and effective cross-modal integration. Our experiments across three benchmark Chinese hate speech datasets demonstrate that MMBERT achieves state- of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both fine-tuned BERT-based baselines and LLMs with in-context learning. In particular, MMBERT shows superior robust- ness in detecting cloaked adversarial content, highlighting the value of multimodal modeling and progressive training for Chinese hate speech detection. We summarize the main contribution of this paper as fol- lows: e We propose MMBERT, a novel multimodal BERT- based framework for Chinese hate speech detection that integrates textual, visual, and speech modalities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, enhancing ro- bustness against cloaking-based adversarial perturba- tions. ¢ We design a progressive three-stage training strategy that first aligns multimodal inputs to the BERT language space, then specializes modality-specific experts, and fi- nally fine-tunes the complete model. This approach en- sures stable training and effective cross-modal represen- tation learning. * We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, comparing MMBERT against fine-tuned BERT- based and open-source LLM baselines and closed-source LLMs with in-context learning. Results demonstrate that MMBERT consistently achieves superior performance, particularly in detecting cloaking perturbed hate speech. Background and Motivation Cloaking Perturbations in Chinese Hate Speech Cloaking perturbations in Chinese online discourse repre- sent a growing challenge for automated hate speech detec- tion systems, as users employ various strategies to obfus- cate offensive content while preserving its intended meaning (Xiao et al. 2024; Xiao, Bouamor, and Zaghouani 2024). It can be mainly categorized into several types: Deformation. As Chinese characters are logographic, their meanings can be altered by decomposing or reconfig- uring individual components, often imparting specific emo- tional or ideological connotations (Lan 2006). For exam- ple, the character “#” (meaning ‘silence’) comprises the BE o> Y radicals “7%” (meaning ‘black’) and KR” (meaning ‘dog’), which in certain contexts have been used to convey deroga- tory implications toward the Black community. Homophonic Substitution. Words with similar pronun- ciations are frequently substituted to generate alternative se- mantics (Tien, Carson, and Jiang 2021). For instance, Chi- nese internet users often replace the character “188” (mean- ing ‘full’) with “Be (meaning ‘barbarian’), as both share a phonetic resemblance to ‘man’. Abbreviation. The contraction of sensitive terms en- hances conciseness while maintaining semantic clarity (Lan 2006). A notable example is ‘txl’, where each letter corre- p99 66 JI IN® c wv sponds to the pinyin initials of “IFl” “f “”, collectively denoting ‘homosexuality’. Code-Mixing. To intensify expressive tone and circum- vent automated content moderation, Chinese social me- dia users frequently incorporate non-Chinese linguistic ele- ments such as pinyin and emojis (Li et al. 2020). These code- mixed constructs not only obscure semantic intent from de- tection systems but also reinforce the emotive or derogatory force of the message. For instance, the term “niet” (meaning ‘ni brother’) phonetically approximates the English racial slur ‘n*gger’. Similarly, in the phrase “W“” (meaning ‘lick- ing dog’), the addition of an emoji amplifies the pejora- tive undertone, characterizing individuals perceived as ex- cessively submissive in relationship contexts—analogous to the English term “sycophant’. These perturbations exploit the unique structural and phonological characteristics of the Chinese language to con- ceal offensive intent (Lu et al. 2023). For instance, visually altering character radicals can introduce ideological conno- tations, while homophones and abbreviations obscure mean- ings through phonetic similarity or reduction. Code-mixing with pinyin or emojis further complicates semantic interpre- tation. Text-only models often fail to capture these manip- ulations due to their limited capacity to disambiguate sub- tle visual and phonological cues (Xiao, Bouamor, and Za- ghouani 2024; Raza Ur Rehman et al. 2025). Enhancing Chinese Language Modeling through Multimodal Pretraining Text-only approaches in Chinese language modeling often face limitations in capturing the full linguistic complexity of the language, particularly with respect to character ho- mographs and tonal ambiguity. These challenges hinder the model’s ability to accurately interpret semantic and phonetic nuances inherent in Chinese. To address these limitations, several studies have explored the integration of additional modalities, such as visual and phonetic information, into the pretraining process. For in- stance, ChineseBERT (Sun et al. 2021) integrates both glyph and pinyin embeddings, enriching the representation of Chi- nese characters by capturing visual features through mul- tiple font variations and phonetic information to resolve the heteronym phenomenon. This dual-embedding approach has shown significant improvements in various Chinese natural language processing tasks, such as named entity recognition and sentiment analysis. Similarly, models like ERNIE-M (Ouyang et al. 2020) and GlyphBERT (Li et al. 2021) have demonstrated the benefits of incorporating external modal- ities, such as entity knowledge and visual cues, to enhance language understanding. However, existing multimodal approaches predominantly rely on embedding-level fusion of heterogeneous input modalities within a fixed BERT encoder architecture. While such integration enhances input representations, the pro- cessing and interaction of multimodal information remain largely static and inflexible. Specifically, the fixed fusion mechanism in standard BERT layers may limit the model’s capacity to dynamically adapt to context-dependent linguis- tic challenges, such as homographs and tonal ambiguity in Chinese. This rigidity restricts the model’s ability to effec- tively leverage the complementary strengths of each modal- ity in a nuanced and input-sensitive manner. Scaling Multimodal Language Models with MoE Architectures Recent advancements in large MLLMs have increasingly ex- plored the use of MoE (Eigen, Ranzato, and Sutskever 2013) architectures to enhance scalability, efficiency, and special- ization across modalities. Early generations of MLLMs, such as Flamingo (Alayrac et al. 2022) and GPT-4V (Yang et al. 2023), are grounded in dense architectural paradigms that encounter scalability limitations as data volume and modality complexity increase. To address this, MoE-based frameworks such as CuMo (Li et al. 2024) and Uni-MoE (Li et al. 2025) introduce sparsely-activated expert mod- ules, allowing modality-specific processing while maintain- ing low inference overhead. CL-MoE (Huai et al. 2025) fur- ther extends MoE for continual learning in vision-language tasks, employing dual routers to balance generalization and retention. Furthermore, MoExtend (Zhong et al. 2024) in- troduces modular extension mechanisms that facilitate the adaptation of pretrained models to new tasks and modali- ties, thereby significantly reducing the computational cost associated with full model retraining. These approaches illustrate that MoE architectures not only enhance computational efficiency but also offer in- creased flexibility in handling multimodal inputs, thereby establishing MoE as a compelling framework for scaling BERT-based models to complex multimodal tasks. Methodology Overview As shown in Figure 1, the MMBERT framework consists of a text tokenizer, word embedding layer, vision and speech encoders, modality aligners, MoE-scaled BERT blocks, and a classification head. Modality aligners project non-text in- puts into a shared linguistic space, enabling effective multi- modal fusion. The MoE layers are integrated into the BERT encoder to dynamically route representations across modal- ities, improving detection accuracy. MMBERT is trained in three sequential stages: Modality aligner training, modality- specific expert training, and MMBERT tuning using a di- verse collection of multimodal Chinese hate speech data. The detailed model architecture, training setting and model efficiency information are provided in Appendix A. MMBERT Architecture Multimodal data generation. To synthesize the visual and audio data of corresponding text input, we employ the Kokoro text-to-speech model (Kaneko et al. 2022) to gen- erate speech data corresponding to the input text. For the visual modality, we render a sequence of word-level font im- ages representing each token in the text, thereby producing a visual analogue of the input. Aligners. To enable the effective transformation of het- erogeneous modality inputs into a unified linguistic repre- sentation space, MMBERT leverages the pretrained visual- language framework LLaVA (Liu et al. 2023) and the speech-language framework SpeechT5 (Ao et al. 2021). Specifically, for visual encoding, we adopt the CLIP-base- Chinese model (Yang et al. 2022), followed by a linear pro- jection layer that maps the extracted visual features into soft image tokens compatible with the embedding space of BERT (Devlin et al. 2019). For speech, we utilize the en- coder from the Whisper-base-Chinese speech recognition model (Radford et al. 2023), likewise augmented with a lin- ear projection layer to project speech features into the same shared linguistic space. The alignment process is formally defined as follows: X ={T,{h,...,In}, 5} (1) T = WordEmbedding(Tokenizer(T)) (2) S' = SpeechAligner(Whisper(.S)) (3) I, = VisionAligner(CLIP(J;)) (4) V=[h,..., Jp] (5) where {T,{li,...,J,},S} represents the text, images and speech inputs respectively. The SpeechAligner and VisionAligner modules are implemented as learnable lin- ear projections that transform modality-specific features into a shared language embedding space. The sequence of word- level font image embeddings is concatenated to form the fi- nal visual token sequence. MMBERT blocks. By the above aligners, we could ob- tain the encoded embedding of different modalities aligned in unified language domain. We concatenate the different modality embeddings as the final input to the MMBERT blocks. We denote the text, speech, vision embedding rep- resentations to T = {T,...,Tn}, S = {S1,...,Sm} V = {V,,...,V,} respectively, where n, m, and k corre- spond to the respective sequence lengths of each modality. The MMBERT block computation proceeds as follows: xj = Self-Atten(LN(X7,_,)) + X1,_1 (7) Xi, = MoE(LN(X7')) + X7, (8) where LN(-) refers to layer normalization, the X i, repre- sents the output latent of the self attention layer in the 7 th MMBERT block, X7, represents the output latent of 7 the MMBERT block. The MoE mechanism incorporates a set of experts EF = {E7, Es, Ey} each implemented as a feed- forward neural network.

The process is formally defined as: P(X?) au (9) Li = (Xe Dim={T,8,V} ef (XP )m MoE(X/)= > (P(X): Bi(X?)) (10) i={T,S,V} where the f(-) denotes the routing function of different modalities implemented as a linear layer, the output weight logits are normalized by a softmax function. The final MoE output is weighted combination of the different modality- specific expert outputs. MMBERT three-stage training strategy To capitalize on the effectiveness of multi-expert col- laboration—where each expert possesses distinct capabil- ities—while retaining the rich contextual and syntactic knowledge encoded in the original BERT model through large-scale pretraining, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy to facilitate the incremental development of MMBERT. As shown in Figure 2, the training process is structured into three progressive stages to enhance the ef- ficacy of multi-expert collaboration through an incremental learning strategy. Stage 1: Aligner Training. The primary objective of the initial stage is to establish effective interoperability be- tween heterogeneous modalities and linguistic representa- tions. Modality-specific MLPs serve as aligners that project inputs from speech and vision into soft token embeddings. These aligners are trained by minimizing the mean squared error between the modality embeddings and the BERT- encoded textual representations. To improve the model’s sensitivity to perturbed speech samples, speech and image representations generated from the perturbed text are aligned with those derived from the corresponding unperturbed text representations during the training process. Stage 2: Expert Training. In this stage, modality-specific experts are trained independently using cross-modal data to specialize in their respective domains. Training continues to be guided by the minimization of cross-entropy loss, while the trained aligners weights in the first stage are adapted and further trained to better capture and represent the unique characteristics inherent to their respective modalities on the Chinese hate speech classification task. To facilitate the pro- jection of heterogeneous modality data into a unified lin- guistic representation space by both the aligners and experts, the classification head originally trained on textual input is shared across other modalities. Stage 3: MMBERT Tuning. The final stage integrates the trained experts into the MoE layers of MMBERT. A context-aware routing mechanism dynamically assigns in- put representations to appropriate experts based on semantic relevance. To prevent unbalanced expert weight distribution, an auxiliary loss is applied to encourage uniform expert uti- lization: Liotal = L cross-entropy +a: Laux a 1) N Lax = N+ So pi: fi (12) w=1 where NV denotes the total number of experts, a represents the weighting coefficient, p; represents the proportion of se- quences routed to expert 7, and f; is the average gating prob- ability assigned to expert 7. The classification head is fine- tuned jointly to generate the final prediction.

Specifically, we adopt several BERT- based models with a fully connected classification layer as encoder-based baselines, and utilize LLMs with structured task-specific prompts as decoder-based baselines. Encoder-Based BERT Models. As_ representative encoder-based BERT models, we select three widely adopted Chinese pretrained BERT-based encoders: BERT! (Devlin et al. 2019), BERT-wwm/ (Sun et al. 2019) and RoBERTa? (Liu et al. 2019). Each model is fine-tuned by attaching a fully connected layer on top of the pooled output from the encoder to perform classification. In addition, we include ChineseBERT (Sun et al. 2021), a recently proposed model that integrates lexicon and phonological features into the standard BERT architecture, to examine its performance under the same experimental settings. Decoder-Based LLMs. For LLM baselines, we assess the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs, includ- ing GPT-3.5 (Brown et al. 2020), GPT-40 (OpenAI 2024), LLaMA3-8B (Meta AI 2024), Qwen2.5-7B&72B (Alibaba 2024), and DeepSeek-v3 (DeepSeek 2024). These models are evaluated under a unified prompt-based inference frame- work. This setup ensures consistency across different mod- els and enables fair comparison with encoder-based models. Dataset To evaluate the proposed MMBERT, we conduct experi- ments on three Chinese hate speech datasets that collectively support comprehensive and robust assessment. ToxiCN (Lu et al. 2023) provides 12,011 samples of standard hate speech annotations for naturally occurring Chinese text, serving as a baseline for evaluating classification performance. Tox- iCloakCN (Xiao et al. 2024) introduces 4,582 cloaking perturbed examples in code-mixing and homophonic sub- stitution, specifically designed to evade text-only detectors while preserving hateful intent, making it essential for test- ing model robustness against cloaking strategies. Finally, COLD (Deng et al. 2022) extends evaluation to a wider spectrum of offensive content with 37,480 samples, offering "https://huggingface.co/bert-base-chinese *https://huggingface.co/hfl/chinese-bert-wwm-base *https://huggingface.co/hfl/chinese-roberta-wwm-ext insight into a model’s generalizability across various forms of toxicity. Together, these datasets form a diverse and chal- lenging benchmark suite for assessing both accuracy and ad- versarial resilience in Chinese hate speech detection. Evaluation method We employ the widely used metrics of accuracy (Acc), macro precision (Pre), macro recall (Rec) and macro F}- score (F1) to evaluate the classification performance of mod- els. For the BERT-based models and open source LLMs with relatively comparable parameter size with MMBERT in the baselines, we fine-tune and reserve the best perform- ing models with hyperparameters on the test set. All datasets are partitioned into training, validation and test sets using an 8:1:1 split ratio with early stopping strategy to prevent overfit during training. For the LLMs in the baselines, we perform few-shot learning with a basic prompt temple with different few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) set- tings, details can be found in Appendix B. All experiments are conducted using a NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU. Result and Discussion Main result Table 1 and 2 presents the evaluation of fine-tuned LLMs, BERT-based models and LLM APIs across the ToxiCloakCN, ToxiCN, and COLD benchmarks using accuracy, macro precision, macro recall, and macro Fl as metrics. MMBERT consistently achieves the highest scores across all three datasets, demonstrating both strong overall performance and robustness to adversarial pertur- bations. Specifically, MMBERT attains macro FI scores of 95.2, 92.2, and 85.8 on ToxiCloakCN, ToxiCN, and COLD, respectively. Compared to the strongest fine-tuned baseline, ChineseBERT, these results represent improvements of 8.4, 1.6, and 3.6 points in macro F1. These gains highlight the ef- fectiveness of integrating textual, speech, and visual modali- ties through the Mixture-of-Experts framework and the pro- gressive three-stage training strategy, which jointly enhance the model’s ability to capture phonological and visual cues indicative of cloaked hate speech.

In con- trast, LLM APIs such as GPT-3.5, GPT-40, LLaMA3-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, and DeepSeek-v3 show limited effectiveness in few-shot and perturbed settings. For example, GPT-40 achieves only 62.4 Fl on ToxiCloakCN under basic prompt- ing, underscoring the insufficiency of in-context learning alone for this domain-specific and adversarial task. Providing both unperturbed and perturbed examples, as well as incorporating CoT prompting, yields modest im- provements for LLMs. GPT-4o, for instance, improves from 62.4 to 69.3 Fl on ToxiCloakCN under the CoT setting. Nevertheless, these enhancements remain far below the per- formance of MMBERT, indicating that domain-adaptive multimodal modeling is critical for robust detection rather than relying solely on prompting. Across datasets, ToxiCloakCN poses the greatest chal- lenge due to heavy use of cloaking perturbations, and MM- BERT is the only model to surpass 90 F1 on this benchmark. ToxiCN represents standard hate speech detection, where all fine-tuned BERT variants perform strongly and MMBERT provides consistent incremental gains. COLD, as a more diverse and open-domain dataset, produces lower overall scores, yet MMBERT maintains the best recall, confirming its generalization to nuanced and implicit toxic language. Overall, the results validate the task-specific multimodal modeling with MoE-based expert routing and progressive training for MMBERT substantially outperforms both fine- tuned text-only models and prompt-based LLMs, particu- larly in adversarial scenarios involving cloaked hate speech. Detailed failure case analyses are presented in Appendix C. Routing distribution analysis We analyze the average routing weight distribution of different experts in MMBERT 12 MoE layers under three hate speech perturbation cate- gories in the ToxiCloakCN dataset as shown in Figure 3. In the non-perturbed setting, the model primarily routes to the text expert, especially in middle layers, reflecting the dominance of textual semantics. Speech and image experts contribute consistently, with image usage slightly increas- ing in deeper layers. Under homophonic perturbation, the model shifts toward the speech expert in early and mid- dle layers, leveraging phonetic cues to resolve ambiguities introduced by homophones. Vision expert assigned weight decreases slightly, while text routing remains stable. In the code-mixing scenario, image experts dominate across most layers, indicating reliance on visual context to address mul- tilingual inconsistencies. Text experts are also more engaged in earlier layers, while speech expert weight declines. These patterns demonstrate MMBERT adaptive routing behavior, where expert activation is dynamically adjusted based on input characteristics, enhancing robustness against modality-specific perturbations.

Specifically, we compare the full pipeline with three variants: without aligner training stage (stage 1), with- out expert training stage (stage 2), and without both stages. All models are trained for 50 epochs on the ToxiCloakCN dataset under identical settings. As shown in Figure 4, the full three-stage strategy achieves the best overall performance, with the lowest train- ing loss and highest validation accuracy. It enables stable convergence and strong generalization, indicating that grad- ual modality alignment and expert specialization are both essential for effective multimodal learning. Without aligner pretraining, convergence is slower and validation perfor- mance is less stable, suggesting suboptimal cross-modal mapping. Removing expert specialization also leads to re- duced accuracy and higher loss, showing that expert-specific representation learning is crucial. The worst performance is observed when both stages are removed, as the model quickly overfits and fails to generalize. These results demon- strate that each stage of the proposed training strategy plays a critical role in enabling MMBERT to effectively detect cloaked hate speech across modalities. Ablation study on modalities To assess the contribution of each modality in the MMBERT framework, we perform 50 Text&Speech Text& Vision Dataset Acc Fl Acc Fl ToxiCloakCN 91.2 91.1 87.7 86.6 ToxiCN 90.1 90.9 889 89.3 COLD 83.1 83.8 82.7 81.9 Table 3: Ablation study evaluating the impact of each modal- ity in the MMBERT framework an ablation study by scaling with single modality, using text paired with either speech or vision. As shown in Table 3, the text and speech combination consistently outperforms the text and vision setting across all three datasets. On the ToxiCloakCN dataset, the F1 score reaches 91.1 when using speech compared to 86.6 when using vision, indicating that speech features are more effective in capturing adversarial cues introduced by cloaking perturbations. This trend is also observed on ToxiCN and COLD, where the text and speech setting yields stronger results. These findings suggest that speech contributes more complementary information than vision and plays a critical role in improving robustness in Chinese hate speech detection. Conclusion We presents MMBERT, a multimodal framework for Chi- nese hate speech detection that effectively incorporates text, speech, and vision using the MoE architecture. To ensure stable integration of modalities, we introduce a progressive training strategy that proves critical for effective optimiza- tion. Ablation studies confirm the importance of both the training strategy and modality fusion, with speech contribut- ing significantly to robustness. Empirical results across mul- tiple benchmarks show that MMBERT achieves strong per- formance, particularly under adversarial conditions involv- ing cloaked perturbations. Our findings highlight the po- tential of task-specific multimodal modeling for addressing complex language understanding challenges, particularly in safety-critical domains like Chinese hate speech detection.

Appendix A: MMBERT Details Model Architecture MMBERT is built upon the BERT-base-chines encoder, which serves as the backbone for tex- tual representation. For modality-specific feature extraction, we employ a vision encoder based on chinese-clip-vit-base-patch16° and a speech encoder based on whisper-base®. Each modality is passed through a dedicated aligner, implemented as a lightweight two-layer MLP, to project the modality-specific features into the BERT embedding space, thereby forming unified token representations. These representations are processed by modified BERT layers in which the original feed-forward networks are replaced by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers. Each MoE layer contains modality-specific experts and a shared self-attention mechanism, with a context-aware routing function that dynamically assigns token sequences to appropriate experts. A classification head is applied to the final output to produce predictions. 4 Training Setting Training is performed in three progressive stages. In stage 1, modality aligners are pretrained using synthetic parallel data to align visual and speech features with their correspond- ing textual embeddings. The learning rate in this stage is set to le-3. In stage 2, modality-specific experts are trained in- dependently using cross-modal supervision, while aligners continue to adapt. During this phase, the learning rate for the aligners is maintained at le-3, the text expert at 5e-6, and the speech and vision experts at 5e-5. In stage 3, all compo- nents are jointly fine-tuned on the multimodal Chinese hate speech detection task using a cross-entropy loss. The learn- ing rate in this final stage is set to 5e-4. To promote bal- anced utilization across experts, we incorporate an auxiliary load-balancing loss into the MoE layers, with a weighting coefficient of le-2. The model is trained for 50 epochs using the AdamW op- timizer and a linear learning rate decay schedule. Excluding the parameters of the modality-specific encoders, the MM- BERT architecture contains approximately 60 million train- able parameters. All experiments are conducted using Py- Torch on NVIDIA A100 GPUs. Model Efficiency Parameter Count. The MMBERT model comprises 297.4 million parameters in total, including 162.4M in the back- bone network (representing a 47% increase relative to BERT-base), 49M in the Whisper-base speech encoder, and 86M in the CLIP-base vision encoder. Computational Cost. A single forward pass requires ap- proximately 58.44 GFLOPs, which is the sum of 12x2.89 GFLOPs from the MMBERT layers, 21.2 GFLOPs from the Whisper-base encoder, and 2.56 GFLOPs from the “https://huggingface.co/bert-base-chinese *https://huggingface.co/OFA-Sys/chinese-clip-vit-base- patch16 Shttps://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-base CLIP-base encoder. The contribution of the pooler and clas- sifier heads is negligible. Routing Overhead. The mixture-of-experts (MoE) layer routing introduces an additional 908.4 MFLOPs (12x75.8 MFLOPs), accounting for approximately 2.6% of the total computational cost. Inference Latency. Under single-query inference with a sequence length of 128 on an NVIDIA H100 GPU, MM- BERT achieves a latency of 6.3 ms in FP32 precision (com- pared to 3.5 ms for BERT-base) and 3.2 ms in FP16 preci- sion (compared to 2 ms for BERT-base).

Two dominant failure modes emerged: Cultural Context Gaps (38%) False Positive Example (COLD): “Taiwanese rednecks leave Weibo” Root Cause: The model misclassifies culturally nuanced ex- pressions as toxic due to limited coverage of regional di- alects and sociopolitical context in the training data. Mitigation Strategy: Diversify annotation teams with na- tive speakers from multiple Chinese-speaking regions and include context-rich examples to reduce such errors. Sarcasm and Reclaimed Terms (32%) True Negative Example (ToxiCN): “We gays are disgusting haha” Root Cause: Binary toxicity labels lack contextual nu- ance. The model cannot distinguish reclaimed slurs or self- deprecating humor from genuine hate. Mitigation Strategy: Introduce ternary labeling schemes (e.g., hate, reclaimed, neutral) or enrich the dataset with metadata such as speaker identity and intent. These errors highlight that MMBERT is sensitive to cultural variation, sarcasm, and reclaimed language. Future work should explore context-aware annotations, richer label tax- onomies, and sociolinguistic metadata to improve robust- ness in real-world deployment.

arXiv:2508.00784v1 [cs.AI] 1 Aug 2025 Unraveling Hidden Representations: A Multi-Modal Layer Analysis for Better Synthetic Content Forensics Tom Or [EMAIL].ac.il Department of Computer Science Ben Gurion University of the Negev Omri Azencot [EMAIL]. il Department of Computer Science Ben Gurion University of the Negev Abstract Generative models achieve remarkable results in multiple data domains, including images and texts, among other examples. Unfortunately, malicious users exploit synthetic media for spreading misinformation and disseminating deepfakes. Consequently, the need for robust and stable fake detectors is pressing, especially when new generative models appear everyday. While the majority of existing work train classifiers that discriminate between real and fake information, such tools typically generalize only within the same family of generators and data modalities, yielding poor results on other generative classes and data domains. Towards a “universal” classifier, we propose the use of large pre-trained multi-modal models for the detection of generative content. Effectively, we show that the latent code of these models naturally captures information discriminating real from fake. Building on this observation, we demonstrate that linear classifiers trained on these features can achieve state-of-the-art results across various modalities, while remaining computationally efficient, fast to train, and effective even in few-shot settings. Our work primarily focuses on fake detection in audio and images, achieving performance that surpasses or matches that of strong baseline methods. 1 Introduction Recently, there has been an abundance of synthetic media emerging across various platforms and domains. Such media results from generative models based on deep neural networks, with novel techniques appearing at an unprecedented rate. Among these generative approaches, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion-based yak podsfEaoew ar oh ae high-resolution and highly-realistic results in multiple domains (Ho et al.| 2024). While generative tools are often used for good purposes, they regrettably become tools for spreading misinformation and disseminating harmful deepfakes when exploited by malicious users. Thus, there is an increasing need for developing automatic approaches for identifying fake information that are robust across existing and future generative techniques. The overall goal of this paper is to advance existing knowledge and tools for automatic deepfake detection of multi-modal data, encompassing both visual and auditory modalities. Early works for identifying manipulated images focused on highlighting visual inconsistencies such as irregular reflections, resampling, and compression artifacts (2017). A similar line of works explored the frequency representation of images where inconsistencies of artificial media manifest as spectral fingerprints (Zhang et al.| |2019} 2020). Recently, learning- based detection approaches emerged for classifying manipulated (Cozzolino et al.| |2015} [Rao & Nil |2016} and generated 2020) images. Recent works of audio deepfake detection use carefully-chosen learning architectures, utilizing either sophisticated prepossessing or innovative deep network structures (Tak et al. 2021). However, a few studies have found that while learned classifiers can be used for identifying synthetic media produced by a single class of generators (e.g., GANs) ) (Cozzolino et al.| [2018 (Zhang et al.| 2019} (Chen et al.| 2020} [Miiller et al.| 2020} |Miiller et al. (2022), they do not generalize to other classes (e.g., diffusion models). Thus, a fundamental challenge in deepfake detection is to develop an approach that has access to on from a single generator, yet it extends to various other generators (Nataraj et al. [2020a). Towards that end, our paper generalizes the work by |Ojha et al.| (2023) which suggested a deepfake detection method that is effective across generative families of visual content by using certain features of CLIP-ViT models (Dosovitskiy et al.| |2021}|Radford et al.}|2021). To date, the detection of deepfakes of multi-modal information has received relatively limited attention in the literature, despite recent advancements in multi-modal learning that have demonstrated significant progress. Models like CLIP have developed shared latent spaces for images and text (Radford et al. |2021), while ImageBind and LanguageBind have extended this concept to multiple data modalities (Girdhar et al. (2024). In the context of deepfake detection, recent studies have observed that the latent representations of CLIP-ViT can effectively distinguish between real and fake visual information (2024). Building on these findings, our work primarily addresses the research question: can latent representations of pre-trained large multi-modal models be effectively leveraged for deepfake detection across modalities, and if so, how? Existing works on images, arbitrarily select features from the last layer of the model (2023), or utilize features from all layers (2024). The choice of last-layer features is natural from a machine learning perspective, as these features often exhibit linear separability (2016). However, CLIP-ViT was not explicitly trained to distinguish real from fake images but rather to align images with corresponding text. Consequently, the linear separability observed in CLIP-ViT’s last-layer features likely reflects semantic relationships between language and vision (2023). Thus, the second research question we address is how to identify the optimal layers for multi-modal deepfake detection. In particular, we opt for a simple approach that requires minimal training, while effectively separating real and fake information. To address the above questions, we propose leveraging the latent representations of large pre-trained multi- modal models for deepfake detection. Specifically, we argue that the most effective features arise from intermediate layers, rather than the initial or final layers. This approach is motivated by the observation that the mata layers of ‘aus mous predominantly encode low-level details, akin to convolutional neural networks (Zeiler & Fergus , while the final layers capture neh level semantic information, particularly the last ‘oe eotle& Fere in ous Tie CLIP-ViT L.| [2023). Consequently, we hypothesize that the “sweet spot” for optimal classification lies in the middle layers, where features balance low-level and high-level details. Our proposed method introduces a novel approach to deepfake detection by utilizing deep features extracted from the middle layers of large multi-modal models, rather than relying solely on features from the final layer or all layers. This straightforward yet effective strategy provides a unified solution across different modalities and generative approaches and it consistently outperforms or achieves similar results to recent approaches. The contributions of our work can be summarized as follows: 1. We extend the recent paradigm of deepfake detection in images, which leverages latent representations of large pre-trained models, to the multi-modal setting. Our work provides an in-depth analysis of such models, focusing on their separation properties across layers to understand their potential for detecting synthetic content. 2. Building on this analysis, we present a novel, unified, and universal multi-modal classifier that leverages intermediate representations for deepfake detection. Our classifier delivers a robust and efficient solution for the automatic identification of synthetic media, accommodating diverse families of generative models and spanning multiple modalities. 3. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over state-of-the-art tools on both image and audio modalities. Furthermore, we highlight several advanced detection capabilities, including clustering-based detection, source attribution and few-shot classification, showcasing the flexibility and versatility of our method. 2 Related Work Generative models. Numerous works have been dedicated to advancing generative modeling across various data types including images, audio and video. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling} |2013) introduced foundational principles like approximate posterior estimation and the re-parametrization trick, extended further in |Higgins et al.|(2017);|/Van Den Oord et al.| (2017); (2019). Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al.||2014) employ a zero-sum game in which a generating network tries to fool the discriminating network, yielding high-quality visual (Chen et al.| content. Diffusion models (Sohl-Dickstein et al.| 2015) progressively add noise to an image and learn a denoising network, allowing to generate images matching in quality to GAN-based tools Dhariwal & Nichol} |[PHONE]!/Rombach et al.||2022). Additionally, diffusion has been adapted for generating varying-length audio (Evans et al.||2024) and video (Blattmann et al.| |[PHONE]). ( ) Given that GAN- and diffusion-based methods are currently state-of-the-art (SOTA), we focus on works designed to identify their synthetic media. Deepfake detection. Visual content generated by GAN techniques tend to leave noticeable traces in the frequency domain, whereas natural images do not exhibit similar patterns (Zhang et al.| |2019 2020a). Other works trained autoencoders to separate real and fake images (Cozzolino et al.| ) Unfortunately, these approaches did not generalize well, even within the class of GANs (Nataraj et al. |2019). To this end, developed an image classifier with blur and JPEG compression augmentations to improve detection accuracy. Still, generalizability was attained only to images sampled from the same family of generators. For audio deepfake detection, some approaches have successfully utilized wav2vec features 2021), while others have adopted end-to-end methods 2021a). However, as highlighted by |Miiller et al.) (2022), the persistent challenge of generalization remains a significant issue. Consequently, following works aimed for a “universal” detector: a deepfake detection method trained on one generator, but extends to multiple other (classes of) generators. For instance, subsequent works trained their classifier on images sampled from a diffusion model, while still detecting GAN images successfully (Ricker et al.||2022). Recently, the features extracted from the last layer and all layers of large vision-language models (CLIP-ViT) were shown to identify synthetic media across generative families (Ojha’ 2023) |Koutlis & Papadopoulos} |2024). However, to the best of our knowledge, no existing detector is capable of identifying multi-modal synthetic data generated by diverse families of generative models. Layer-wise analysis of deep networks. Analyzing the inner mechanisms of modern neural networks is a longstanding problem (Zeiler & Fergus) |2014). Large vision models are often explained by generating heatmaps that emphasize areas of an image deemed most critical to the model’s output (Binder et al.|/2016 Lundberg & Lee] 2017] Sundararajan ot al] 2019} Chefer et al,] 2021). Other approaches use the intermediate representations of deep models by inverting them to images (Mahendran &| (2016), as well as interpreting neurons 2020). A manifold learning viewpoint has been suggested for studying the properties of individual layers (Ansuini et al.|/2019} 2023). Recently, several techniques used text to interpret inner encodings of vision models (Materzyriska et al. 2023). In particular, a technique for assigning attention heads of CLIP with text was proposed (Gandelsman et al. (2023), showing that the last four layers of CLIP are most dominant in image representation. While analysis of recent multi-modal models such as LanguageBind and ImageBind remains limited, we argue that their internal representations exhibit semantic properties akin to those of CLIP, given their similar training methodologies and architectural designs. This assumption drives our approach to exploit these representations for the unified and robust detection of fake information across multiple modalities. Concurrent deepfake tools. Here, we also mention very recent approaches for images and audio. As for the image domain, embed an invisible watermark, allowing for future detection. Additionaly, The DeepFakeFace dataset was introduced in |Song et al.| (2023), along with two evaluation methods. Fact checking was employed to verify whether generated images are consistent (2023). Another approach for image forensics was based on comparing rich and poor real and generated Layer 12 Last layer DALL-E ce Layer 12 BigGAN Last layer In-the-Wild Figure 1: We plot two-dimensional t-SNE (pre-trained) embeddings of real (blue) and fake (orange) content related to the generative models BigGAN (top), DALL-E (middle), and In-the-Wild (bottom). Clearly, the intermediate features separate between real and synthetic media better than the first and last layers. textures (Zhong et: al.||2024). Recently, (2024) showed that fewer samples can be used within CLIP models for a robust detection. As a final example for the image domain, we also mention an adversarial teacher-student discrepancy-aware framework (Zhu et al.||2023), achieving strong discriminative results. As for audio, utilizes the difference in high frequencies between real and generated audio for enhanced detection. Lastly we mention (2023), who utilized a large pre-trained audio model for feature extraction, integrating these features with a specifically designed classifier and pooling method for effective deepfake audio detection. 3. Background Problem statement. The problem we are set to solve in this paper can be defined as follows. Let the single generative model, where 7 represents the sample index. We denote by D a deepfake detection model that takes a sample c as an input, and returns a binary classification, specifying whether c is natural or synthetic. To distinguish between generative models, we denote by {c,2 generated by the method j. Then, our goal is that D attains the best measures on {c!,}.4 as well as several {ce2}.m, where some j are of different classes of generative models, e.g., GAN and diffusion-based. Examples images, and EER (Equal Error Rate) for audio (Lu et al.||2024). Multi-modal models. The main idea behind the multi-modal models considered in this work is the training set be composed of real content {c’,};y and fake content {ci}, of modality M, generated using a Jy as the dataset of fake content indexed by 7 and of evaluation measures include the accuracy and mean precision (Nataraj et al.||2019;|Zhang et al.||2019) for learning of latent representations for various data modalities in a shared embedding space.

C) Similarly to B), however reporting the EER on In-The-Wild dataset using ImageBind latent features. first approaches to achieve this was trained on a large collection of paired images and text, aligned using similarity matching, for example, by minimizing the cosine similarity (Radford et al.||2021). Recent advances have extended this concept, notably by incorporating multiple data modalities such as audio, depth, and thermal data, as demonstrated by LanguageBind and ImageBind (Girdhar et al.| |[PHONE]). These approaches are similarly trained with similarity matching, leveraging contrastive estimation, where representations of paired samples are drawn closer in the embedding space while representations of unpaired samples are pushed apart. To formalize this, consider a paired sample, ci, and Cua: drawn from modalities My, and Mg, respectively. The widely used InfoNCE loss (Oord et al. takes the form: La, Ms = —log exp (q, k;/r) mu exp (q,' ki/7) + do j4i EXP (ai kj/T) } ° where q; and k; are encoded representations of Cu, and Cy respectively, and k; represents the encoded (1) representation of a dissimilar sample Cys: The parameter 7 is a temperature scaling factor. The summation in the denominator includes all unpaired samples, marked by the subscript 7 4 i, which are dissimilar to Cu: Trained in this way, multi-modal models enable various downstream tasks including cross-modal retrieval and zero-shot classification, demonstrating the flexibility of the embedding space across a broad set of inputs. 4 Analysis In{Ojha et al.| (2023), the authors propose to utilize the features of the last layer of CLIP-ViT for deepfake detection. In contrast, concatenated features from all layers. The following discussion highlights that either choice may be sub-optimal, toward addressing the question: What is the optimal multi-modal model layer for deepfake forensics? Similar to previous works, the underlying hypothesis in this paper is that synthetic media exhibit identifiable fingerprints. These artifacts may be noticeable to some extent in the frequency domain (2020). In this paper, unlike existing literature on this topic, we introduce another hypothesis, motivated by the roles of layers in CLIP-ViT. Specifically, we believe that the intermediate layers of CLIP-ViT extract improved digital fingerprints and frequency information for image forensics in comparison to the first and last layers. Additionally, we suggest that this behavior is not limited to CLIP-ViT, and it generalizes to other multi-modal frameworks when trained similarly, as proposed in|Girdhar et al.| (2023); (2024). To verify our hypothesis, we consider a series of experiments, whose results guide our approach, as described in Sec. 2D t-SNE embeddings. In this analysis, we extract features of real and synthetic samples from certain layers of the pre-trained CLIP-ViT model and ImageBind, and we view their distribution in a shared space. To this end, we extract features from the first, middle, and last layers. Then, we reduce their dimension using t-SNE (Van der Maaten & Hinton||2008).

The results, consistent across datasets and generative methods, demonstrate that the middle layers are most dominant for classification. painting the real and fake points in blue and orange. Fig.|/1]demonstrates the plots, where BigGAN (Brock & 2019) embeddings are shown in the top row, DALL-E (Ramesh et al.||2021) embeddings in the middle row, and In-the-Wild (Miiller et al.|/2022) audio embeddings in the bottom row. Importantly, |Ojha et al. perform deepfake detection based on the features obtained from the last layer, where t-SNE struggles to separate real and fake information. In comparison, there is a clear separation between the two point clouds in the intermediate layer (‘Layer 12/5’). We show in the appendix in Fig. [6] that a similar behavior appears for images from other GAN and diffusion generative models. Cluster separability. We extend the above analysis by estimating the separability of image clusters using machine learning tools. In this experiment (and in the next one), we consider three different scenarios of varying training sets: 1) we used 80% of the dataset (full); 2) we used only 15 examples (few-shot); and 3) we employ JPEG with a compression level of 50 (few-shot + JPEG). We computed k-means clustering over the features of every layer and every generative model in our benchmark. To measure separability, we estimate the Davies—Bouldin index (DBI) score (Davies & Bouldin} |1979) which is given by k i= _ il Oi +0; DBI := pms (422) >0, (2) where & = 2 is the number of clusters, c; is the centroid of cluster i, 0; denotes the mean distance of all points in cluster 7 to c;, and d(-,-) is the Euclidean distance. A low DBI score means well-separated clusters. We illustrate in Fig. the DBI scores per layer for the three scenarios mentioned above. Remarkably, the results coincide with our general hypothesis in that the first and last layers are challenging to discriminate, and intermediate features are well-separated. Finally, compressed synthetic images (green curve) are harder to separate, consistent with observations reported in |Zhong et al.) (2024). SVM-based detection. We also train SVM classifiers in the three configurations above (full, few-shot, and few-shot + JPEG), and we measure the average accuracy of real and fake media across all generative models in our image benchmark. Specifically, given a dataset j, we use the images J,’ as inputs to CLIP-ViT, and we compute their features Zi; for every image 7 and layer 1. The SVM classifier is trained on the features Zi, or their subset, depending on the particular configuration (full, few-shot, and few-shot + JPEG). We show the average accuracy vs. layer plots for the three scenarios in Fig. 2p. Similarly, we trained additional SVM classifiers on audio in full and few-shot setting, using ImageBind audio encoder as a feature extractor and report the EER (Equal Error Rate) per layer in Fig. [2)0. Lower values are better. Our results show characteristic profiles, shared across all the scenarios. Particularly, the mean accuracy for image classification is low at the first and last layers, whereas performance is higher for intermediate layers. Surprisingly, utilizing only 15 images is sufficient to achieve > 90% mean accuracy (orange). Also, similar to the above experiment, compressed images yield the poorest overall detection results. The same trend repeats in the audio setting, whereas the EER is high in the first and last layers, and low at the intermediate layers in both settings. ae | Fiime x ; ° _ —(-)—) MLP/ |_— eee e@ee © Shared y | Feature “yy Space ; Fond * 4 | ffgad __ S) __| MLP/ ey eee eee SVM concat S ey Pre-trained Multi-modal Model | LJ LL _J , k k Figure 4: We leverage a pre-trained multi-modal model with one encoder per modality (Eimg, Esna,*++)- Our deepfake detection approach extracts latent representations from the 2k + 1 middle layers of the encoder, concatenates them, and inputs the combined features into a linear classifier. Layer-wise weight contribution. Finally, we conducted an analysis involving all layers of the model. Specifically, we concatenated the outputs from all layers and trained a classifier using this concatenated representation. To determine the importance of individual layers, we employed L1 regularization during training, which encourages sparsity in the learned weights. By analyzing the distribution of the absolute values of these weights, we identified which layers contribute most significantly to the detection task. We summed the absolute value of each weight for each layer, shown in Fig 3] Aligning with our other analysis, the intermediate layers hold the highest weight values, while the first and the last layers are mostly sparse. 5 Method We propose a framework for detecting synthetic content using a multi-modal model M, trained on modalities mM 1,™M2,..-,;7M%n, each associated with a dedicated encoder EF, E2,...,H,. The model employs a contrastive loss LZ to learn unified representations across modalities. To detect synthetic content in a specific modality m,;, we leverage the encoder £; corresponding to that modality. Let | denote the total number of layers in E;, and h,; represent the feature representation at the i-th layer. Our approach extracts latent representations hj; from E; as features and trains a lightweight classifier on them. During this process, the encoder E; is kept frozen, and only the classifier parameters are updated. To highlight the robustness of the proposed features, we employ simple classifiers, including a single-layer MLP and a linear SVM. The method is illustrated in Fig. |5| which outlines the architecture of the multi-modal model. We hypothesize that the most discriminative features for this task are concentrated in the middle layers of E;. To leverage this, we define a symmetric range of layers around the middle layer and select k layers from this range as features, where k is a hyperparameter. Specifically, if k = 0, only the middle layer representation hi is used. The value of & is restricted toO < k < 4. Classifier training employs cross-entropy for the MLP and standard hinge loss for the linear SVM, underscoring the method’s simplicity and effectiveness. We additionally introduce a simply method for choosing k at Appendix{A] 6 Experimental Setup In this work, we limit our exploration to the detection of image and audio modalities. For images, we largely follow the experimental setup of prior works in the field 2023). Specifically, the training set for our classifier is composed of real and synthetic images from ProGAN (Karras et al.|/2018), while testing is conducted across multiple other datasets. The training set includes 20 distinct categories, each containing 18,000 synthetic images generated using ProGAN, alongside an equal number of real images sourced from the LSUN dataset (2015). For audio, we use a diverse collection of generated audio samples produced by various methods, including In-the-Wild and ASVSpoof2019 (Miller et al.| |2022 2020b). As for pre-trained model, we consider ImageBind audio encoder. Below, we outline the baselines used for comparison and the evaluation metrics. It is worth noting that training of all classifiers across all modalities is performed for only one epoch. Generative models. Many new generative models have been introduced over the past few years. Similar to existing image-based deepfake detection works, we focus our evaluation on GAN- and diffusion-based | (2019), SAN (Dai , and DeepFakes (Rossler et al.||2019). Additionally, we also test with (2023): Guided (Dhariwal & Nichol] 2021), LDM (Rombach (2022), Glide 2022), and DALL-E (Ramesh et al. . We incorporate variants of LDM and Glide, as was introduced in (2023). For LDM, three variants are compared: 200 steps, 200 steps and classifier-free guidance, and 100 steps; for Glide, different number of steps introduced in the two separate stages of noise refinement, creating three variants: 100-27, 50-27, and 100-10. Finally, we include two additional models shown in|Zhong et al.| (2024): StyleGAN2 2020}, and WhichFacelsReal (WFIR) (2019). Similarly to work on visual content, audio generation has evolved rapidly in recent years, and various generation methods have emerged. To validate robustness, we consider ASVSpoof2019 [2020b); particularly its Logical Access (LA) part, which contains fake human speech generated with 19 different TTS models, and In-the-Wild which extends ASVSpoof2019 with ‘real-world’ synthetic audio, containing fake audio samples from 58 politicians and celebrities. respect to the techniques shown in Deepfake detection baselines. In our evaluation on images, we compare our results with respect to all the methods shown in|Ojha et al.| (2023), and further, we also consider some of the most recent state-of-the-art approaches for identification of synthetic content. CNNDet constructs a standard image classifier, trained with careful pre- and post-processing procedures and data augmentation. We use two variants of CNNDet with Blur and JPEG compression of levels 0.1 and 0.5, denoted as ‘CNNDet1’ and ‘CNNDet2’, respectively. The patch classifier utilizes limited receptive fields, and we consider two different backbones for this architecture: ResNet50 (‘PatchDet1’) and Xception (‘PatchDet2’). In{Nataraj et al.| (2019), CNN classifiers and co-occurrence matrices (‘CO’) are used. A GAN simulator was designed to produce the artifacts of synthetic media in|Zhang et al.| (‘FreqSpec’). The Universal Fake Detector (‘UFD’) method by is mostly related to ours as they extract the features of the last layer of a pre-trained CLIP-ViT model, and train a simple classifier using those features. RINE (Koutlis leverages all CLIP-ViT layers, with an additional contrastive loss and a learnable layer-importance module. Finally, FreqNet (/Tan et al.||2024) focuses on high-frequency information across spatial and channel dimensions, resulting in a frequency domain learning approach. Our evaluation on audio data is based on comparing with the same models as in|Miiller et al.}(2022). LCNN 2020) learns a transformer with a convolutional neural network (CNN) using the characteristics of only genuine speech. RawNet2 is an end-to-end model. It employs Sinc-Layers 2018), which correspond to rectangular band-pass filters, to extract information directly from raw waveforms. RawPC is also based on Sinc-Layers to operate directly on raw wavforms, however, the model architecture is found via a novel differentiable architecture search. Finally, RawGAT-ST is a spectro-temporal graph attention network (GAT). It introduces spectral and temporal sub-graphs and a graph pooling strategy to discriminate between real and fake audio. We omit from our comparison works with no available code or weights, and works that are concurrent to ours. Evaluation metrics. Similar to many existing works on this topic, we use two quantitative metrics to compare the performance of our approach with respect to other methods. The first metric, accuracy (ACC) (Wang et al.| |2020a) |Ojha et al.||2023), measures the ratio between the true classifications vs. the whole data. The second metric, the mean precision (mAP) (Lin et al.||2014;|Zhou et al.}|2018} [PHONE]) measures the average of real and fake precision measures. The precision is calculated as the ratio between the true classifications of e.g., fake data vs. all data that was classified as fake. For audio-based detection, we show the EER (Equal Error Rate), similar to other works. EER, quantifies the trade-off between the false acceptance rate and false rejection rate. It is the point on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve where the two error rates are equal. A lower EER indicates better system performance.

[I] and [2] In addition to the considered baselines, we experiment with several variants of our approach, denoted by Ours (CLS;) where CLS is the classifier (MLP or SVM) and k is the symmetric range parameter (see Sec. [5). For instance, Ours (SVMmax) represents our approach, trained using an SVM classifier with the maximum k& = 1/2. Tab. [1] details the accuracy and mean precision measures in the format ACC / mAP for GAN-based models. Diffusion and autoregressive methods are considered in Tab. |2| where the top part details ACC, and the bottom part shows the mAP. On GAN data, we find FreqNet to produce strong results, except on WFIR. UFD attains good scores on most GAN approaches, however, its effectiveness reduces on StyleGAN2 and WFIR. Surprisingly, CNNDet1 is somewhat robust across all datasets, however, it is also sensitive to the choice of compression parameter, cf. CNNDetl and CNNDet2. We observe that most deepfake detectors struggle to generalize to diffusion-based and autoregressive generators, as shown in Tab. |2} In contrast, our approach demonstrates strong and robust ACC and mAP scores across all generators, rivaling the latest state-of-the-art method, RINE, while utilizing fewer parameters and a linear classifier. We conclude this experiment by evaluating the overall ACC and mAP averages of our best-performing model, Ours (SVMg), across all datasets. These results, summarized in Tab. |3| demonstrate that our approach outperforms RINE in terms of accuracy (ACC) while achieving comparable performance in mean average precision (mAP).

Following [Miiller et al. (2022), we train our classifier exclusively on the ASVSpoof2019 dataset, while testing is conducted on both the ASVSpoof2019 test set and the In-The-Wild dataset. Our classifier is built using the ImageBind backbone (Girdhar et al. (2023), leveraging publicly available weights from HuggingFace. The results, presented in Tab. |4| (left), demonstrate strong performance on ASVSpoof2019 and state-of-the-art results on In-The-Wild. Our findings suggest that the superior performance on In-The-Wild is due to the reduced overfitting compared to competing methods, which tend to overfit the ASVSpoof2019 training set. Furthermore, our approach requires significantly fewer computational resources, including reduced training time, compared to other methods. Finally, we evaluate our method in a few-shot setting, utilizing only 200 samples (approximately 1% of ASVSpoof2019) while maintaining the original dataset’s label ratio. This scenario better reflects real-world conditions. The results, shown in Tab. |4] [4] ( right), highlight the effectiveness of our approach in the few-shot context, achieving notable improvements over RawGAT-ST ( (Tak et al.| [2021b). Table 4: Full-shot (left) and few-shot (right) EER values for In-the-Wild and ASVSpoof2019 datasets.

[6.1] is considered the standard benchmark in the community, we propose below a new benchmark for detectors that are based on latent features. The key idea behind the proposed benchmark is to exploit the clustering properties of latent representations. Intuitively, if data representations of the same class, e.g., fake images, concentrate in a specific sub-domain of the entire space, then, the whole cluster can be classified together in a straightforward fashion. For this benchmark, we compare UFD that uses only the last layer to our method with only the middle layer, i.e. Ours (SVMo). However, any other detection technique can be also considered in the context of this benchmark, if it produces representations from which (quasi-)linear classification is performed. The experimental setup of our benchmark is constructed as follows. We sub-sample 200 examples from ProGAN, and compute their latent representations with UFD and our method. Given these features, we train a single SVM classifier per method to convergence, and we use it later for identification. Then, for every generative model and its associated real and fake datasets, we compute their 10 features. Importantly, we pre-process these features by applying dimensionality reduction. This is done to address some of the challenges in estimating Euclidean distances in high-dimensional spaces, which can distort true data relationships (Aggarwal et al.||2001). Using the lower-dimensional features, we cluster that information with k-means where k = 2 (Lloyd}|1982). Finally, we classify the features with the pre-trained SVM per cluster, and we employ a majority vote to determine the clusters’ labels. For instance, if one cluster is 60% real, and the other cluster is 51% fake, then we determine clustering based on the first cluster, setting the labels of all images in the first cluster to be ‘real’, and in the second cluster to be ‘fake’. Notice that this choice of labeling is robust to pathological cases where both clusters attain the same label from SVM. Our clustering benchmark is different from the standard benchmark in Sec. in a few aspects worth mentioning. First, in the standard setting, we do not assume that we have access to the entire test set, and here, we require the data to compute clustering. While our additional constraint here is somewhat limiting, we believe that it is also practical in many scenarios where a collection of media needs to be classified. Second, the standard benchmark uses the raw CLIP-ViT features, and in contrast, we reduce the dimensionality of the features to facilitate clustering. Finally, labeling in the standard case is done on a per-sample basis, whereas here, the entire cluster is labeled together. This means that the clustering benchmark depends on the implicit assumption that same-class images are clustered together and are separable from other classes of images. Overall, we believe that our new benchmark sheds a new perspective on the features of pre-trained multi-modal models. We detail the results of UFD and our approach for the above experiment in Tabs. [5] and [6] for GAN-based tools and diffusion models, respectively. The reported results represent the accuracy measures. The mAP can not be measured fairly in this case, as there is no clear threshold. While studying the results, we observe that UFD often yields ~ 50%, which is the random baseline, implying that it erroneously labels both clusters to be ‘real’ (or ‘fake’). This observation may be justified by re-considering the 2D t-SNE point clouds plotted in Figs. [IJand [6| showing entangled features at the last layer. In comparison, our approach attains almost perfect results in many of the datasets, yielding weak classifications only for Deep fakes and StyleGAN. Nevertheless, our approach is better than UFD in all the considered generative models. In particular, UFD obtains mean accuracy of 59.12% and 74.62% for GAN and diffusion models, respectively. In comparison, our technique achieves 93% and 91.15%. In total, UFD has a mean accuracy of 68.72%, whereas we get 91.85%.

However, subsequent works observed that synthetic media generated with diffusion models demonstrate significantly weaker spectral traces in comparison to GANs (2023). In this context, there is an overarching question underlying our research: Do generated images contain latent features different from natural images? If so, are these latent features different for different generative models? While our study above mostly focused on the first question, the following experiment aims to address the latter question. Towards that end, we utilize the latent representations of CLIP-ViT to identify the source of the generative model. 11 While it is crucial to distinguish between real and fake content, we believe that identifying the particular generative model that generated the data can be instrumental in several scenarios. For instance, tools for source identification can be employed in copyright disputes. Another example is related to improving the accuracy of a specific deepfake detection approach, e.g., DIRE-D excels in detecting diffusion generated media (2023). To adapt our approach to allow for source identification, we perform the following. First, we extract the latent features of a certain layer of CLIP-ViT for the datasets: BigGAN, GauGAN, DALL-E, Guided, StyleGAN, CycleGAN, StyleGAN2, StarGAN, Glide, Stable Diffusion (2022), Midjourney, and MidjourneyV5 (2023). Each dataset contains 500 images. These datasets encompass a combination of state-of-the-art GAN and diffusion models, providing a comprehensive evaluation framework. Second, we randomly sample a minimal set of 10 images from each dataset. Then, we use the sampled extracted features (120 in total) to train a single SVM. Finally, we test the remaining 490 images per method on the trained SVM. We repeat this experiment for UFD and for our approach with k=0. Tab. [7|shows the results for the source identification experiment in a confusion matrix. The generative models listed on the left are the true sources, whereas the top models represent the predicted classes. The values are in percentages, given in the format a / b, where a is the accuracy of UFD and 0 is our accuracy measure. Ideally, if the main diagonal of the confusion matrix shows 100 in all its cells, then the classification is perfect. We denote in bold the values along the main diagonal that are best per generative model. These results indicate that UFD performs relatively well on GAN approaches, but it struggles with most diffusion-based media. Remarkably, our approach yields high scores in most cases, except for some confusion between Midjourney and MidjourneyV5. Further, our classification results are better than UFD in all cases, often by large margins, StyleGAN excluded. We conclude from this experiment that CLIP-ViT has the ability to embed different generative models separately in its latent representations, allowing to robustly identify the source of the generated content.

One of the main challenges is that existing generative models vary in their underlying technologies and fundamental theories, and thus, there is a need for developing universal detectors, effective across multiple generative tools, families, and modalities. In this work, we analyze the inner representations of large vision-language and other large-multi-modal models. Our analysis shows that intermediate layers provide robust features for detection, allowing to classify real and fake images using a simple linear classifier. We extensively evaluate our approach on standard benchmarks and in comparison to recent state-of-the-art works. In addition, we also show that our approach allows detection via clustering. One limitation of our method, shared with many other deepfake detectors, is its robustness to noise. Presumably, modifying the original synthetic images results in losing the latent fingerprints enabling their 12 detection. We would like to further investigate this aspect in future work. More generally, our method raises several intriguing questions: What underlying patterns do intermediate representations capture that facilitate accurate source identification? Do the middle layers of contrastive multi-modal models retain critical generative characteristics better than the final layer, which may focus more on high-level semantics? Can we distinguish between diffusion models and GAN? We would like to focus in the future on addressing these questions, towards the development of better deepfake automatic techniques. 13 References Midjourney: Expanding the imaginative powers. https: //midjourney.com/| Accessed: 2024-05-19.

The validation set is augmented with jpeg-compression, and the model is trained on 100 randomly sampled instances from the training set. The reported scores represent the mean accuracy over 10 runs A Choosing & The selection of k = 9 is based on prior findings by |Gandelsman et al.| (2023), which demonstrate that the last four layers of CLIP primarily capture high-level semantic information. Since such information is less beneficial for our task, we discard these layers. To maintain consistency and simplicity in our approach, we frame our selection symmetrically around the middle layer, leading to the k = 9 setting. However, to enhance robustness, we propose a data-driven approach for selecting k. A standard approach for selecting discrete hyperparameters involves performing a grid search over the hyperparameter space and choosing the setting that performs best on validation data. However, in our case, models typically perform well on their training distribution but generalize poorly to other generative models. Selecting & based solely on validation performance within the training set would therefore be misleading. For instance, as shown in Table|1} all models achieve strong performance on the ProGAN test split but perform significantly worse on other generative models. To address this issue, we propose training on only a small subset of the available training data while validating on a larger, compressed-augmented dataset that better approximates unseen generative distributions. This approach helps reduce the risk of overfitting to the given training distribution. We report the results for different & values for CLIP-ViT on the ProGAN augment-validation set in Fig [5] Our findings indicate that the best performance for CLIP-ViT is achieved for 7 < k < 10.

Instead of training biased classifiers, recent work suggested to utilize the feature space learned by CLIP-ViT models (Dosovitskiy et al. |2021}|/Radford et al.||2021), trained on internet-scale image-text pairs (Ojha et al.||2023}|Koutlis & Papadopoulos} |2024). We briefly recall the main components of CLIP-ViT, essential for describing our approach, following the notation in |Gandelsman et al.| (2023). CLIP embeds images I and texts t within the same latent space by optimizing the cosine similarity between Mimg(I) and Mixt(t), where Mimg(-) and Mix¢(-) are image and text encoders, respectively. CLIP represents an image I ¢ R#**3 using an encoder Mime that projects the d features learned from the image J by a vision transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al.||2021), namely, Mimg(I) := PViT(I), PER. (3) ViT is a residual network of L layers, each includes a multi-head self-attention (MSA) followed by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) block. In practice, the image I is decomposed into patches, projected to tokens 2,....2%, that form the columns of Z° € R?*(N+), where the first column is the class token 29. Given Z°, ViT 21 performs the following residual stream Z'=MSA'(Z'"1)4 271 Z' =MLP'(Z!) + Z'. (4) Finally, the output of ViT is the first column of Z”, corresponding to the class token, [Z/] 1s. ImageBind. ImageBind learns a joint embedding space across six modalities: images, text, audio, depth, thermal, and IMU data 2023). Unlike models requiring all combinations of paired data, ImageBind aligns each modality to images, leveraging naturally occurring image-paired data. This approach enables zero-shot capabilities across modalities without explicit pairing between all modalities. For instance, by aligning text and audio embeddings to image embeddings, ImageBind facilitates cross-modal retrieval tasks, such as retrieving an audio clip from text. ImageBind encodes each modality separately with a transformer and employs contrastive learning to align modality-specific embeddings with image embeddings, resulting in a unified representation space that supports various emergent applications across different modalities. C_ Noise robustness Noise robustness is a critical property for ensuring model performance and reliability in real-world applications where data is often imperfect or corrupted. Specifically, we modify the datasets considered in Sec. [6.1] with an additive Gaussian noise with zero mean and variances o = 1,2. A similar test is also performed in previous work [Ojha et al.| (2023). We utilize the same experimental setup and evaluation as discussed in Sec. with k=9. The results are presented in Tabs. [8] and [9] for GAN- and diffusion-based methods. The tables are organized in a similar format to Tabs. To ease readability, we place competing approaches in subsequent rows, e.g., UFD, o = 1 and Ours, o = 1 detail the results for the Gaussian noise experiment for UFD and our method, respectively. We also list the overall ACC and mAP averages in Tab. While both approaches attain lower measures for noisy images, we find our approach to be more resilient in comparison to UFD.

arXiv:2508.00701v1 [cs.CV] 1 Aug 2025 D3: Training-Free AI-Generated Video Detection Using Second-Order Features Chende Zheng! Ruiqi Suo! Shuai Liu'* Minghui Yang? 2Guangdong OPPO Mobile Communications Co., Ltd. ‘Xi’ an Jiaotong University Chenhao Lin?* Zhengyu Zhao! Le Yang! Cong Wang’ Chao Shen! 3City University of Hong Kong Abstract The evolution of video generation techniques, such as Sora, has made it increasingly easy to produce high- fidelity Al-generated videos, raising public concern over the dissemination of synthetic content. However, exist- ing detection methodologies remain limited by their insuf- ficient exploration of temporal artifacts in synthetic videos. To bridge this gap, we establish a theoretical framework through second-order dynamical analysis under Newtonian mechanics, subsequently extending the Second-order Cen- tral Difference features tailored for temporal artifact detec- tion. Building on this theoretical foundation, we reveal a fundamental divergence in second-order feature distribu- tions between real and Al-generated videos. Concretely, we propose Detection by Difference of Differences (D3), a novel training-free detection method that leverages the above second-order temporal discrepancies. We validate the superiority of our D3 on 4 open-source datasets (Gen- Video, VideoPhy, EvalCrafter, VidProM), 40 subsets in to- tal. For example, on GenVideo, D3 outperforms the previ- ous state-of-the-art method by 10.39% (absolute) mean Av- erage Precision. Additional experiments on time cost and post-processing operations demonstrate D3’s exceptional computational efficiency and strong robust performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zig-HS/D3. 1. Introduction With the development of AI [23, 37, 53], generative mod- els have evolved into versatile tools for high-fidelity con- tent creation. However, their pervasive deployment across digital ecosystems has precipitated critical societal se- curity risks—systematically undermining information in- tegrity and eroding public trust [12, 38, 57] - evidenced by cases like the Taylor Swift deepfakes [2]. Consequently, there is an increasing and urgent demand to develop a de- tector of AI-generated videos. Traditional research on deep forgery detection focuses on facial forgery (e.g., Deepfakes) *Corresponding Authors Real Video Frames Al-generated Video Frames First-Order Differences Second-Order Differences Figure 1. Real and Al-generated videos can be differentiated by second-order (temporal) features in our Detection by Difference of Differences (D3) method. The optical flow vectors are obtained by RAFT [42]. First-order features are less powerful (see Table 8.) but is unable to generalize to universal videos. For this, there has been some recent aiming at the generalization detection of Al-generated videos, e.g., DuB3D [27], De- CoF [33], DeMamba [16], etc. These methods commonly learn the differences between real and AlI-generated videos from the training data by using deep learning frameworks. However, despite these efforts, there is still a lack of in- terpretability research on Al-generated video detection. To address this, we introduce the second-order position con- trol system under Newtonian mechanics theory. We extend the Second-order Central Difference features from this sys- tem to AI-generated video detection and validate significant differences in second-order features between real and AI- generated videos by conducting visualization experiments on differential optical flow. More concretely, we propose Detection by Difference of Differences (D3), a training-free Al-generated video detection framework based on second- order features. Technically, we use a pre-trained visual encoder to ex- tract zero-order features from the input video by frames. Then, we employ L2 distance (or cosine similarity) to assess the inter-frame differences as first-order features. We further compute the second-order features according to the Second-order Central Difference formula. Our em- pirical findings show that the second-order features of real videos exhibit more significant volatility, while AI- generated videos tend to follow a flatter pattern (Figure 1). Therefore, we quantify the volatility by calculating the stan- dard deviation of the second-order features and realizing the generalized detection of Al-generated videos. Besides, to comprehensively evaluate the generalization ability of D3, we conduct an open-world evaluation, which validate D3’s superior detection performance. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows: By rethinking Newtonian mechanics, we innovatively in- troduce the second-order central difference features of videos. Our experiments reveal the differences in second- order features between existing Al-generated videos and real videos. We propose D3, a novel training-free Al-generated video detection method. By extracting second-order features, our detector is capable of generalizing across various gen- erators. The extensive experimental results on 4 different open- source datasets, including 40 test subsets, demonstrate the state-of-the-art (SOTA) generalization performance as well as strong robustness to the post-processing opera- tions of our method. 2. Related Work 2.1. Video Generation Methods Recent advances in video synthesis, predominantly built on diffusion models, focus on text-to-video, image-to-video, and combined text-image approaches. A core challenge re- mains ensuring logical coherence and smooth temporal con- tinuity. To address this, Text2 Video-Zero [28] enriches la- tent codes with motion dynamics, while Zhang et al. [55] leverage visual guidance in I2VGen-XL for coherent high- resolution generation. Similarly, Xing et al. [48] and Chen et al. [15] incorporate motion cues—via video diffusion priors and generation-stage cues, respectively—to simu- late realistic motion and enhance frame transitions. For long videos, SEINE [18] automates smooth transitions us- ing scene images with text control. Regarding datasets, SVD [13] demonstrates that fine- tuning on small, curated datasets yields higher-quality, sta- ble models compared to non-curated alternatives. While these video generation methods have yielded promising results, we have found that they still produce videos that do not fully comply with the physical laws of the real world. Therefore, there is still significant room for improvement in video generation. 2.2. Al-Generated Video Detection As video synthesis quality advances, effective AIGC detec- tion for videos becomes increasingly critical. Traditional deepfake detection focuses on facial artifacts (e.g., distor- tions in landmarks [51] or head pose inconsistencies [30]). These methods struggle with complex scenes. Recent ap- proaches shift toward global characteristics: NPR [41] ana- lyzes neighboring pixel relationships, while others leverage pre-trained models [9, 36, 40] or data augmentation [20, 26] to improve diffusion-image detection. For videos generated by Diffsion Models, recent ad- vances now extend to universal detection, exemplified by DeMamba [16], which introduced a dedicated Mamba module for video detection and developed the Gen-video dataset, which was specifically designed for AlI-generated video detection tasks. In a similar vein, Liu et al.[31] pro- posed a CNN+LSTM architecture that utilizes DIRE[46] residuals to classify videos as real or generated, while De- CoF [33] presented a detector that focuses on temporal ar- tifacts, aiming to identify AlI-generated videos by analyz- ing these specific features. These approaches contribute to the growing field of AI-generated video detection, each ad- dressing unique aspects of the challenge. However, although these methods strive to distinguish between real and Al-generated videos, they still lack a deep analysis of temporal artifacts, resulting in a missing en- lightening motivation for the interpretable detection of AI- generated videos. 3. Methodology 3.1. Motivation The key to detecting AlI-generated videos lies in identi- fying the artifacts that differ from real videos. Existing detection methods focus on pixel-level temporal artifacts of specific regions (e.g., lips and facial edges). However, as the quality of the generated video improves, the gen- eralization performance of these methods continually de- creases. An effective solution is to analyze the artifacts from a theoretical perspective. For this, we propose an anal- ysis method based on second-order features to investigate the differences in second-order features between real and Al-generated videos. Specifically, we start by modeling a second-order position control system under Newtonian me- chanics in the real world, which can be represented by the following equation: da(t) dax(t) ae +i dt 2 + Aox(t) = u(t) (1) where Ag is the inertia coefficient (i.e. second-order co- efficient), A, is the damping coefficient, Ag is the elastic- ity coefficient, and u(t) represents the input force. Note that real-world systems are typically higher-order systems, ( Y hepsi cere? ‘Similarity — @ \ Real Video Frame2 Embedding Frame3 i Embedding . % Embedding First-order features Zero-order features ) | Second-order — Real Video — Al-generated Video ME Real Video mE Al-generated Video features Standard Deviation ; 4 Frame N } o ; i (a) Zero-order feature extraction (b) First-order feature extraction (c) Second-order feature extraction Figure 2.

For a given video, (a) zero-order, (b) first-order, and (c) second-order features are subsequently extracted. but they can be reduced to second-order systems using the Dominant Pole Approximation [35}). According to the Principles of Automatic Control, when solving a second-order control system, we use the second- order central difference method to approximate the deriva- tive of the differential equation. In other words, the second- order ordinary differential equation can be discretized to ob- tain a numerical solution. Therefore, we can approximate the acceleration f” (x) (i.e. second-order feature) using the Second-order Central Difference [35] as follows: pix) = LEN = MW) +LE—M Gy f(a) = fw =) = h (3) where «x is the time point, h is the sampling interval, and f' (x) represents the first-order difference feature. A correct mechanical simulation model should adhere to the physical laws of the real world, which means that the simulated acceleration (i.e., the second-order feature) should follow the same paradigm as real-world objects. Therefore, a video generation model is expected to ensure the second-order features of the videos to exhibit similar patterns in real videos. To verify whether existing video generators can ac- curately fit the second-order features of real videos, we conduct a visualization experiment on both real and Al-generated videos by extracting optical flow, using RAFT [42]. In this experiment, we extract two optical flow features from the video X = 21, %2,...,2N. The first op- tical flow is calculated between frames x; and x;41, while the second optical flow is calculated between frames x+41 and 2442. These optical flows represent the speed of pixel change over time, i.e., the first-order difference feature in Formula (2). Therefore, the difference between these two optical flows, Xaipz, reflects the change in optical flow speed from frame x; to frame x;+2 (1.e., optical flow ac- celeration), and is expressed by the following formula: OF (#141, ®i42) — OF (a4, 441) At? Xaiff = (4) where OF (x, y) represents the optical flow between frames x and y, and At is the sampling interval. Figure | displays the visualized optical flow and the cor- responding vector diagrams. The results reveal a clear dis- tinction in the second-order features between real videos and AlI-generated videos. Real videos exhibit more chaotic speed variations, as shown in Figure | (1)-(d) & (2)-(d), re- flecting the higher complexity and diversity driven by var- ious influencing factors in real-world scenes. In contrast, generated videos tend to show very flat patterns, which could be due to existing generators’ difficulty in simulating second-order dynamics, resulting in ’smoother’” video out- puts constrained within the distribution range of their train- ing data. These observations support our hypothesis that current generators fail to accurately replicate real videos’ second-order features, providing motivation and opportu- nity for AI-generated video detection through second-order feature analysis. 3.2. Detection by Difference of Differences We have confirmed the distortion of second-order features in existing video generators on pixel level and optical flow level, however, these features are challenging to compute directly. A feasible approach is to use a visual encoder to perform feature dimensionality reduction on video frames, transforming pixel-level features into deep representations. Based on this, we introduce a training-free mathematical detection method based on second-order features, aiming to realize the Detection on Difference of Differences (D3). Given an input video X € R?*3*4#*W which is sam- pled into a sequence of frames X = X,, Xo,...,X 7 ata regular intervals of At. We utilize visual encoders (e.g., DINOv2, XCLIP or pre-trained ResNet-18, etc.) to en- code the input frames into a sequence of features fy = Fi,..., Fo, Fo € R™*%. Within the feature space, the first-order features are first extracted. Specifically, we use L2 Distance or Cosine Similarity to calculate inter-frame similarity, as the first-order difference features, formulated as follows: _ dis(FG, Fo") F2(k) = ay , k=1,2,..,.T-1 (5) : pk Prot rger(py = Fos Fo). k=1,2,..,7-1 (6) where k is the frame index. Then, we further compute the second-order central difference feature according to For- mula (2), as follows: Fi (k) — Fi(k — 1) At , F2(k) = k=2,..,T-1 (1 We present the first-order and second-order features (ab- solute values) extracted from real and Al-generated videos in Figure 2. The results show that, compared to generated videos, the temporal second-order features of real videos exhibit more pronounced fluctuations, which is consistent with the conclusion drawn in Figure |. To measure this volatility, we calculate the standard devi- ation of the second-order features, as the following formula: 1 fa 1 fo o(F2) = T_3 2 (Fl - P_3 d Fy(i))? (8) We use this standard deviation as the final output to clas- sify real and generated videos. The overall pipeline of D3 is shown in Figure 2. Compared to existing image or video detection methods, our approach has significant advantages: A) D3 is training-free, consisting solely of an inference pro- cess, and does not require generated videos. B) D3 demon- strates exceptional computational efficiency, with the pri- mary computational cost stemming from visual feature ex- traction. Furthermore, our experimental results (see Sec- tion 5.1) indicate that D3 remains effective even when using lightweight feature extractors. 4. Experiments 4.1. Experimental Setup Training Datasets. Considering that D3 operates solely during inference, the experiments require no training datasets. However, for a comprehensive comparison, we still set up a training dataset for baselines. Specifically, fol- lowing the settings from DeMamba [16], we use real videos from Youku-mPLUG [49] and Al-generated videos from Pika [8] to train baselines. Test Datasets. To assess the generalization ability of our approach to real-world scenarios, we adopt the 4 out-of- distribution datasets, including 40 test sets: GenVideo [16]: ModelScope (MSE) [43], MorphStu- dio (MSO) [7], MoonValley (MV) [6], HotShot [5], Show_1 [54], Gen2 [21], Crafter [15], LaVie [45], Sora [14], and WildScrape (WS) [47].

We perform comparisons of our approach with existing popular and state-of-the-art detectors, including 3 image-level detectors, FID (NeurIPS’24) [56], NPR (CVPR’24) [39] and STIL (MM’21) [24], 6 video-level de- tectors, FTCN (ICCV’21) [58], MINITIME (TIFS’24) [19], TALL (ICCV’23) [50], XCLIP (ECCV’22) [34], AIGVDet [10], and DeMamba [16]. We re-implement baselines [10, 16, 39, 56] with the of- ficial codes using our training set. We report the results of the baselines [16, 19, 24, 34, 50, 58] on GenVideo dataset from [16]. Implementation Details. We adopt pre-trained XCLIP- B/16 [34] as the visual encoders to extract zero-order fea- tures and L2 Distance to calculate first-order features. Dur- ing inference, we extract a segment from the input video (up to 2 seconds) and frames are sampled at equal intervals of 8 frames per second. All frames are set to JPEG for- mat. For pre-processing, we crop 10% of the longer edge of all frames and then resize the frames to 224 x 224 pix- els. We adopt the Average Precision (AP) and the Area Un- der the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC, AUC) as the evaluation metric, which is widely used in baselines [16, 19, 24, 34, 39, 50, 58]. (AUC results are provided in the Supplementary Materials.) All of our ex- periments are conducted using PyTorch on AMD EPYC 7763 64-Core CPU and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Ten- sor Core GPU. 4.2. Detection on Gen Video We conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of var- ious Al-generated video detectors, evaluating their gener- alization performance on the GenVideo dataset.

Meanwhile, MINITIME, FTCN, and TALL also perform poorly on Gen- Video, because they are designed for detecting forged facial videos. Interestingly, FID demonstrates strong generalization, which can be attributed to its unique generalization design. FID focuses on the local feature information of images, which enables it to remain unaffected by specific seman- tic scenes. Nevertheless, compared to the latest video de- quire additional generated videos. The results validate our hypothesis that existing video generators cannot accurately model the second-order features of real videos. Further- more, based on this hypothesis, we can realize accurate de- tection by calculating the second-order features using math- ematical methods. 4.3. Detection on More Challenging Datasets To further assess the generalizability of D3, we extend the evaluation to three more challenging open-source datasets (EvalCrafter, VideoPhy, VidProM), with results presented in Table 2, 3, & 4.

For image- level methods (FID, NPR), 8 images form a video. superiority of D3. In these additional experiments, we can observe that image-level detectors (FID and NPR) exhibit stronger gen- eralization than video-level baselines. This is interesting, as it contradicts conclusions from recent research (e.g., De- CoF [33] and DeMamba [16]). We attribute this to two fac- tors: 1) FID and NPR are designed for generalization in cross-scene and cross-generator settings; 2) Due to changes in generative models, AI-generated videos on these datasets exhibit more diverse video artifact features. However, uni- versal image-level artifacts still persist (e.g., upsampling ar- tifacts [22]). Besides, we find that D3 performs poorly on the T2VZ dataset. We attribute this to the low generation quality of T2VZ, which leads to poor semantic consistency in the gen- erated videos, making them resemble chaotic images rather than dynamic videos. A detailed discussion is provided in the Supplementary Materials. Despite this, D3 achieves impressive mean APs, out- performing the best-performing baselines. In sum, the re- sults across 40 test subsets underscore the remarkable gen- eralization capability of D3, which can be attributed to D3’s successful identification of the substantial differences in second-order features between real and AJ-generated videos, further highlighting the limitations of current video generators in fitting second-order features. 4.4. Efficiency Comparisons In Table 5, we present the time costs per 1,000 video sam- ples for baselines and D3 across different stages. The results demonstrate D3’s superior computational efficiency. Unlike deep learning-based classifiers, D3 is training-free, elim- inating substantial preprocessing and training overheads. For instance, on our training set (192,000 samples), De- mamba requires 10.45 hours per epoch (batch size 1) and 3.25 hours per epoch (batch size 32). When the training set is set to a larger open-source dataset (e.g., GenVideo train- ing set with a total of 2,262,086 samples), the advantages of D3 become even more pronounced.

Qualitative Analysis To further demonstrate the effectiveness of D3, we con- duct qualitative analysis by visualizing XCLIP attention and second-order optical flow, as shown in Figure 4. We can see from Figure 4 that variations in 2nd-order flow appear around moving semantics or objects (high- lighted by the XCLIP attention). This is aligned with phys- ical principles (e.g., Newtonian inertia) stating that the ob- ject’s motion in real-world scenarios follows high-order dy- namics. Besides, the results demonstrate that current video gen- erators fail to learn similar second-order patterns from real videos well (see second-order optical flow in Figure 4), Gaussian Blur JEPG Compression Visual Encoder 0=0 o=1l o=2 o=3 o=4 g=100 g=90 gq=80 gq=70 gq=60 DINOv2-B 96.84 96.00 93.39 90.42 88.34 96.84 95.60 94.93 94.36 93.59 DINOv2-L 96.23 95.28 92.00 88.85 87.10 96.23 94.65 93.93 93.16 92.53 CLIP-B/16 97.82 97.16 83.70 83.20 84.89 97.82 84.86 83.31 81.59 78.81 XCLIP-B/16 98.46 97.63 9443 93.19 92.69 98.46 97.11 96.24 95.63 94.50 CLIP-B/32 97.71 97.05 8450 85.13 86.56 97.71 91.65 89.79 88.04 86.40 XCLIP-B/32 98.15 97.64 = 95.51 94.22 93.59 98.15 97.59 97.37 97.25 96.93 ResNet18 97.35 96.60 92.84 90.70 90.03 97.35 96.61 95.48 94.09 92.48 VGG16 97.21 95.56 90.91 87.28 85.60 97.21 94.06 92.35 89.47 87.58 EfficientNet-b4 96.53 95.44 90.63 8859 88.13 96.53 94.81 93.37 91.85 90.54 MobileNet-v3 96.86 =95.92 87.91 8466 84.38 96.86 94.58 91.29 88.31 85.95 Table 6. Detection results of D3 against post-processing operations on Gen Video. which explains the effective detection performance of D3 using second-order video features. 4.6. Robustness to Post-processing Operations In real-world scenarios, videos are seldom pristine. As videos circulate in cyberspace, they are continuously sub- jected to compression and interference, potentially leading to a performance degradation of video detectors. To ad- dress this, in this section, we evaluate the robustness of D3 against various post-processing operations. Specifically, we consider five different levels of Gaussian blur (a = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) and JPEG compression with five different quality factors (q = 100, 90, 80, 70, 60). We use the mean AP on GenVideo as the metric. Figure 3 reveals detection results of baselines and D3 (using XCLIP-B/16 and L2 Distance) against post- processing, with D3 demonstrating the strongest robust- ness through minimal degradation under Gaussian blur and JPEG compression. As the degree of post-processing oper- ations increases, D3 maintains high detection performance, indicating its excellent robustness against post-processing operations. However, FID and Demamba show pronounced vulnerability, suffering significant performance declines, re- flecting their reliance on high-frequency details and suscep- tibility to spectral artifacts. Table 6 reports the results of the robustness experiments of different variants of D3. As can be seen, different vi- sual encoders exhibit varying levels of robustness. For ex- ample, MobileNet-V3 shows a noticeable performance drop when confronted with (o = 4) Gaussian blur (from 96.86% to 84.38%), whereas XCLIP-B/16 exhibits a smaller de- crease (from 98.46% to 92.69%). This is understandable because MobileNet is a lightweight vision network with a smaller parameter scale. These results reveal that the detec- tion robustness using second-order features depends on the stability of the feature space. Therefore when using self- supervised visual models based on ViT (e.g., XCLIP-B/16), D3 demonstrates better robustness. 5. Ablation Studies 5.1. Impact of Visual Encoders So far, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of D3 in generalized detection. In the above experiments, D3 uti- lizes the pre-trained XCLIP-ViT-B/16 model, which raises a new question of whether generated video detection us- ing second-order coefficients relies on large-scale visual en- coders. To address this, we conducted several ablation ex- periments using different visual encoders. We adopt several large-scale self-supervised models based on ViT, including CLIP-ViT, XCLIP-ViT, DINOv2, and their variants with different patch sizes or parameter scales. Additionally, we adopt CNN-based models for classification, e.g., ResNet18, VGG16, EfficientNet-B4, or lightweight networks like Mo- bileNet. These CNN-based models are all pre-trained on ImageNet. The results of the ablation experiments are shown in Ta- ble 7. An intuitive conclusion is that large-scale visual en- coders perform best in our experiments, e.g., CLIP-ViT- B/16 and XCLIP-ViT-B/16. Among the ViT-based models, the impact of patch size and parameter scale is negligible, as evidenced by the minimal differences between XCLIP- ViT-B/16 and XCLIP-ViT-B/32. Nonetheless, despite the significant differences in pa- rameter scale or model architecture among these visual en- coders, the differences in detection performance are small. For example, as a lightweight model, MobileNet-V3 still produces an impressive result of 96.31%. This phenomenon is encouraging because it confirms that second-order fea- tures remain meaningful across different encoder feature spaces. This insight helps us understand the shortcomings of current video generators in simulating reality.

Impact of First-order Features In this section, we delve into the impact of different first- order feature extraction methods. Specifically, we adopt L2 distance and cosine similarity separately as the first-order feature. The experimental results are shown in Table 7. These results indicate that using L2 distance as the first- order feature yields better performance. The key takeaway is that L2 distance evaluates the absolute distance between inter-frame features, while cosine similarity evaluates the relative distance. Cosine similarity can better mitigate the effects of differing feature dimensions. However, in our ex- periments, the visual encoder is fixed, and therefore, the output feature dimensions are fixed. Besides, cosine sim- ilarity will be influenced by the features of the initial frame, whereas L2 distance can accurately reflect the extent of video change within this fixed feature space. Therefore, it provides more effective information. 5.3. Second-Order vs. First-Order Features In this section, we explore the impact of feature order on the D3 method. Specifically, we replace the second-order feature standard deviation in the original scheme with the first-order feature standard deviation and evaluate it on 4 datasets. Table 8 presents the results of our ablation study. As shown, D3 using first-order features achieves good per- formance (95.69% mAP and 93.45% Avg. AUC) on Gen- Video. However, this performance cannot be generalized to more challenging datasets. Overall, using second-order features provides stronger detection capability. These results suggest that, although there are some differences in the first-order features be- tween real and Al-generated videos (as shown in Figure 1), such differences are not universal, while second-order dif- ferential features are more powerful. 6. Conclusion and Outlook This paper bridges the theory of second-order control sys- tems from Newtonian mechanics with video analysis by ex- tending second-order central difference features for tem- poral artifact detection. Our systematic analysis reveals that existing AlI-generated videos diverge from real videos in their second-order feature, establishing a novel physical perspective for investigating temporal artifacts in synthetic content. Building on these insights, we proposed D3, an in- novative, training-free Al-generated video detection frame- work. By measuring the volatility of second-order features in videos through standard deviation, D3 achieves gener- alizable detection of AlI-generated videos. Through exten- sive experiments, we demonstrate that D3 achieves state- of-the-art performance in detecting Al-generated videos across various generative models as well as strong robust- ness against post-processing operations. Our approach paves a new way for understanding and differentiating between real and Al-generated videos based on the connection between video content and fundamental physical principles. Future investigations can explore this paradigm by examining additional dimensions (e.g., tempo- ral channel relationships, RGB color space distributions, or bitrate characteristics) to deepen our understanding of gen- eration artifacts. We believe this paper will inspire further research into the artifacts of Al-generated videos and con- tribute to the development of generalized detection.

August 1, 2025 Abstract Clinical decision-making in radiology increasingly benefits from artificial intelligence (Al), particularly through large language models (LLMs). However, traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for radiology question answering (QA) typically rely on single-step retrieval, limiting their ability to handle complex clinical reasoning tasks. Here we propose an agentic RAG framework enabling LLMs to autonomously decompose radiology questions, iteratively retrieve targeted clinical evidence from Radiopaedia.org, and dynamically synthesize evidence-based responses. We evaluated 24 LLMs spanning diverse architectures, parameter scales (0.5B to >670B), and training paradigms (general-purpose, reasoning-optimized, clinically fine-tuned), using 104 expert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA- RadioQA and ExtendedQA datasets. Agentic retrieval significantly improved mean diagnostic accuracy over zero-shot prompting (73% vs. 64%; P = 2.3 x 107”) and conventional online RAG (73% vs. 68%; 5.0 x 107°). The greatest gains occurred in mid-sized models (e.g., Mistral Large improved from 72% to 81%) and small-scale models (e.g., Qwen 2.5-7B improved from 55% to 71%), while very large models (>200B parameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally, agentic retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved Clinically relevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even clinically fine-tuned models exhibited meaningful improvements (e.g., MedGemma-27B improved from 71% to 81%), indicating complementary roles of retrieval and fine-tuning. These results highlight the potential of agentic frameworks to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA, particularly among mid-sized LLMs, warranting future studies to validate their clinical utility. 1. Introduction Artificial intelligence (Al) is rapidly transforming diagnostic radiology by enhancing imaging interpretation, improving diagnostic precision, and streamlining clinical workflows'?. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs)*’, such as GPT-4°8, have shown remarkable capability in tasks ranging from extracting structured information from radiology reports and assisting in clinical reasoning, to facilitating seamless natural language interfaces**"'”. Despite these capabilities, a significant limitation persists: the static nature of LLMs' training data, which can lead to incomplete, outdated, or biased knowledge, thus compromising clinical accuracy and reliability. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)'%, which combines LLMs with domain-specific external knowledge sources, has emerged as a promising strategy to address these limitations. By grounding model-generated outputs in up-to-date and verified information, RAG could enhance the factual accuracy of LLM responses and reduces the risk of hallucinations, generated outputs without factual basis®°'*-"”. Tayebi Arasteh et al. recently introduced Radiology RAG (RadioRAG)'®, an online RAG framework utilizing real-time information from Radiopaedia’?, demonstrating substantial accuracy improvements in certain LLMs, such as GPT-3.5-turbo compared to conventional zero-shot inference. Nevertheless, these improvements were inconsistent across all evaluated models, with models like Llama3-8B showing negligible gains, highlighting inherent limitations in traditional single-step retrieval architectures. Current online RAG frameworks", including RadioRAG"®, primarily employ a single-step retrieval and generation process, limiting their ability to manage complex, multi-part clinical questions effectively’. This design lacks the capability to iteratively refine queries, dynamically seek additional information, or systematically evaluate intermediate uncertainty*'. Consequently, there is a clear need to evolve RAG approaches towards more sophisticated reasoning and retrieval strategies"®. Recently, agentic frameworks have emerged as an advanced paradigm within Al research, particularly for LLMs*?**4. These frameworks enable models to autonomously orchestrate retrieval?°, reasoning, and synthesis in iterative multi-step chains?°?’, allowing for dynamic adaptation and enhanced problem-solving capabilities?*°°. Agentic approaches have demonstrated notable success across various domains, including clinical decision-making, oncology, and scientific research, by enabling models to dynamically select retrieval strategies, systematically evaluate intermediate results, and adapt their reasoning strategies based on evolving contexts***'. For example, agent-based systems have improved the accuracy and interpretability of Al-driven decisions in oncology”?, general clinical tasks, and biomedical research”?, demonstrating clear advantages over static prompting and traditional RAG methodologies. However, despite these promising outcomes in other clinical domains, the utility and effectiveness of agentic LLMs for specialized radiological applications remain largely unexplored. Radiology presents unique challenges, characterized by diverse and complex clinical questions often requiring nuanced, multi-step reasoning and domain-specific knowledge retrieval. In this study, we address this crucial gap by systematically evaluating the effectiveness of agentic LLMs in radiology question answering (QA), specifically by integrating them into an online RAG framework leveraging the comprehensive radiological knowledge base of Radiopaedia.org. Our approach leverages a multi-agent pipeline that autonomously decomposes each clinical question into structured diagnostic options, retrieves targeted evidence from Radiopaedia.org, and synthesizes evidence-based responses through iterative reasoning steps. We utilize a benchmark dataset comprising 104 expert-curated radiology questions from previously established RSNA-RadioQA and ExtendedQA datasets, both from the RadioRAG study’®, comparing the diagnostic performance of zero-shot inference, non-agentic online RAG, and our agentic approach. Supplementary Table 1 reports the characteristics of the datasets. Our evaluation spans 24 different LLMs encompassing a broad spectrum of architectures, parameter scales, and training paradigms. These include proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4-turbo®, GPT-3.5- turbo), open-weight models (e.g., Mistral Large, Qwen 2.5°°), and domain-specialized variants fine-tuned for clinical applications (e.g., MedGemma™, Llama3-Med42*°). The models range from small-scale architectures (as low as 0.5 billion parameters) to mid-sized (17—110B) and very large models exceeding 200 billion parameters, including substantially sized systems such as DeepSeek-R1* and 03. For details on different models used in this study, refer to Table 1. This breadth allows us to systematically assess the impact of agentic retrieval across general-purpose, medically fine-tuned, and reasoning-optimized LLMs within a heterogeneous model landscape for radiology QA. Our results show that agentic retrieval consistently enhances diagnostic accuracy and factual reliability across most model classes. The improvements are most prominent in small and mid-sized models, where conventional retrieval methods are often insufficient. In contrast, very large models (>200B parameters) with strong internal reasoning capabilities tend to benefit less from external evidence, reflecting their extensive pretraining and broad generalization ability. Nonetheless, even clinically fine-tuned models exhibit meaningful gains from agentic reasoning, suggesting that retrieval and fine-tuning offer complementary strengths. Additionally, we show that agentic retrieval reduces hallucinations and retrieves clinically relevant content that can assist not only LLMs but also expert radiologists. These findings highlight the potential of agentic frameworks to improve factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA, warranting further investigation into their clinical utility and practical integration. We provide an overview of our entire pipeline in Figure 1 and illustrate a full worked representative example for a clinical question in Figure 2, with additional methodological details outlined in Materials and Methods.

Results 2.1. Agentic retrieval improves radiology QA performance on average We assessed the diagnostic performance of 24 LLMs across three distinct inference strategies: zero-shot prompting, conventional online RAG, and our proposed agentic RAG framework. The LLMs __ included: Ministral-8B, Mistral Large, Llama3.3-8B%’°8, — Llama3.3-70B°"*8, Llama3-Med42-8B**, Llama3-Med42-70B*, Llama4 Scout 16E%, DeepSeek R1-70B*, DeepSeek-R1°°, DeepSeek-V3°°, Qwen 2.5-0.5B*, Qwen 2.5-3B°, Qwen 2.5-7B*, Qwen 2.5-14B**, Qwen 2.5-70B**, Qwen 3-8B*°, Qwen 3-235B*°, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4-turbo®, 03, MedGemma-4B-it**, MedGemma-27B-text-it*, Gemma-3-4B-it*'4?, and Gemma-3-27B-it*. Accuracy was measured using the 104-question RadioRAG benchmark dataset, with detailed results presented in Table 2. When aggregating results across all LLMs, the agentic RAG framework demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in accuracy compared to zero- shot prompting (P = 2.3 x 107”). As previously established, the traditional RAG approach also outperformed zero-shot prompting, showing a smaller but statistically significant gain (P = 0.013). Importantly, the proposed agentic framework further outperformed traditional online RAG (P = 5.0 x 107°), underscoring the benefit of iterative retrieval and autonomous reasoning over single- pass retrieval pipelines. These findings indicate that, at the group level, agentic reasoning introduces measurable and additive improvements in radiology question answering, even when compared against established, high-performing RAG systems. 2.2. Agentic retrieval improves factual grounding and reduces hallucination To assess factual reliability under the agentic framework, we conducted a hallucination analysis across all 24 LLMs using the 104-question RadioRAG benchmark. Each response was reviewed by a board-certified radiologist (TTN) to evaluate (i) whether the retrieved context was clinically relevant, (ii) whether the model's answer was grounded in that context, and (iii) whether the final output was factually correct. Context was classified as relevant only if it contained no incorrect or off-topic content relative to the diagnostic question, a deliberately strict criterion. Under this definition, clinically relevant evidence was retrieved in 46% of cases (48/104). Detailed results are provided in Table 3. When relevant context was available, most models demonstrated strong factual alignment. Hallucinations, defined as incorrect answers despite the presence of relevant context, occurred in only 9.4% + 5.9 of questions. The lowest hallucination rates were observed in large- scale and reasoning-optimized models such as 03 (2%), DeepSeek R1 (3%), and Qwen 3-235B (5%), reflecting their superior ability to integrate and interpret retrieved content (see Figure 3). In contrast, smaller models such as Qwen 2.5-0.5B (26%) and Gemma-3-4B-it (20%) struggled to do so reliably, exhibiting significantly higher rates of unsupported reasoning.

This figure shows the full agentic workflow for a representative question (RSNA-RadioQA- Q53) involving a patient with systemic symptoms and a low signal intensity left atrial mass associated with the interatrial septum. The pipeline begins with keyword-based summarization to guide retrieval, followed by parallel evidence searches for each diagnostic option using Radiopaedia.org. Retrieved content is synthesized into a structured report, including an introduction, citation-backed analyses of all options (cardiac myxoma, papillary fibroelastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and left atrial thrombus), and a neutral conclusion. The approach supports interpretable, evidence-grounded radiology question answering.

This behavior was particularly pronounced among models with strong internal reasoning capabilities, DeepSeek-V3, 03, and Qwen 3-235B each exceeded 40%, suggesting that in the absence of relevant evidence, these models often defaulted to internal knowledge. Similar trends were observed in mid-sized and clinically aligned models, such as Llama3.3-70B, Mistral Large, and MedGemma-27B-text-it, which also maintained high accuracy without external grounding. Conversely, smaller models like Qwen 2.5-0.5B (21%) and Ministral-8B (35%) were less effective under these conditions, indicating greater dependence on successful retrieval. Across models, an average of 14.6% + 6.4 of questions were answered incorrectly under zero-shot prompting but correctly after agentic retrieval, highlighting the additive diagnostic value of structured evidence acquisition. Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 provide example responses from GPT-3.5-turbo with and without agentic retrieval, alongside the corresponding retrieved content. These findings indicate that agentic retrieval improves factual grounding and reduces hallucination by enabling structured, clinically aware evidence refinement. However, model behavior in the absence of relevant context varies substantially, with larger and reasoning-tuned models demonstrating greater resilience through fallback internal reasoning. 2.3. Agentic retrieval improves performance in small-scale LLMs We next assessed whether model size influences the effectiveness of agentic retrieval in radiology question answering (see Figure 4). Across the seven smallest models in our study (including Ministral-8B, Gemma-3-4B-it, Qwen 2.5-7B, Qwen 2.5-3B, Qwen 2.5-0.5B, Qwen 3- 8B, and Llama-3-8B), we observed a consistent trend: conventional online RAG outperformed zero-shot prompting (P = 0.002), and the agentic framework further improved over both baselines (P = 0.016 vs. zero-shot; P = 0.035 vs. traditional online RAG). When examining individual models, only two of the seven demonstrated statistically significant improvements with agentic retrieval compared to zero-shot prompting: Qwen 2.5-7B (71% + 4 [95% Cl: 62, 80] vs. 55% +5 [95% Cl: 45, 64]; P = 0.040) and Ministral-8B (66% + 5 [95% Cl: 57, 76] vs. 47% + 5 [95% Cl: 38, 57]; P = 0.019). The remaining models exhibited absolute accuracy improvements ranging from 3% to 16%, though these did not reach statistical significance after correction for multiple comparisons. These findings suggest that agentic RAG can enhance performance in small-scale LLMs. However, the degree of benefit varied across models, likely reflecting differences in pretraining data, instruction tuning, and architectural design, even within a similar parameter range. a Hallucination rates using the agentic framework N a Hallucinations (%) LLMs b Correctness rates despite irrelevant context 43 43 49 4l MN HITT] | PS, se Se Sy 2S & og Correct despite irrelevant context (%) LLMs c Agentic gain over zero-shot responses 26 95 1 21 21 21 99 20 | & ° S © P&S KX OY SX & YP WP & ry & SX © S oN oes SEES SS wt Zero-shot incorrect but a correct (%) ? ~~ ¥ ¢ & i oF se ny bie Ow & oF Fo ES LLMs Figure 3.

Each bar plot shows the proportion of cases per model falling into a specific factuality category, with models ordered by descending percentage.

(b) Context irrelevance tolerance: Cases where the model produced a correct response despite the retrieved context being unhelpful or irrelevant (context = 0, response = 1). (c) Agentic correction: Instances where the zero-shot response was incorrect but the Agentic strategy successfully produced a correct response (zero-shot = 0, agentic = 1). 10 2.4. Very large LLMs show no benefit from retrieval augmentation We next evaluated the effect of agentic retrieval on the largest LLMs in our study, comprising DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-V3, 03, Qwen 3-235B, and GPT-4-turbo, all likely to be exceeding 200 billion parameters. These models demonstrated strong performance under zero-shot prompting alone, achieving diagnostic accuracies ranging from 76% to 86% on the RadioRAG benchmark (Table 2). Neither conventional online RAG (P = 0.757) nor agentic retrieval (P = 0.299) led to meaningful improvements. Across all five models, accuracy differences between the three inference strategies were minimal (see Figure 4). For example, DeepSeek-R1 performed at 82% + 4 [95% Cl: 74, 89] with zero-shot, 80% + 4 [95% Cl: 72, 88] with agentic retrieval, and 79% + 4 [95% Cl: 71, 87] with conventional online RAG; 03 improved marginally from 86% + 4 [95% Cl: 78, 92] to 88% + 3 [95% Cl: 81, 93] with agentic RAG; and Qwen3-235B and GPT-4-turbo showed <1% changes across conditions. DeepSeek-V3 showed slightly higher improvement (from 76% + 4 [95% Cl: 67, 84] to 86% + 4 [95% Cl: 78, 92]) but still not significant. Traditional RAG showed similarly negligible differences. These findings indicate that very large LLMs can already handle complex radiology QA tasks with high accuracy without requiring external retrieval. This likely reflects their extensive pretraining on large-scale corpora, improved reasoning abilities, and domain-general coverage, diminishing the marginal value of either conventional or agentic retrieval augmentation in high- performing settings. 2.5. Agentic RAG yields consistent gains in mid-sized models Mid-sized models, typically ranging between 17B and 110B parameters, represent a particularly relevant category for clinical deployment, offering a favorable trade-off between performance and computational efficiency. This group in our study included GPT-3.5-turbo, Llama 3.3-70B, Mistral Large, Qwen 2.5-70B, Llama 4 Scout 16E, Gemma-3-27B-it, and DeepSeek-R1-70B. Across this cohort, the conventional online RAG framework did not yield a statistically significant improvement in accuracy over zero-shot prompting (P = 0.253). In contrast, the agentic RAG framework significantly outperformed both zero-shot (P = 0.001) and traditional RAG (P = 0.002), suggesting that the benefits of agentic reasoning become more apparent in this model size range, where LLMs are strong enough to follow reasoning chains but may still benefit from structured multi-step guidance. While every model in this group showed an absolute improvement in diagnostic accuracy with the agentic system, for example, GPT-3.5-turbo improved from 57% to 68%, Llama 3.3-70B from 76% + 4 [95% Cl: 67, 84] to 83% + 4 [95% Cl: 75, 89], and Mistral Large from 72% + 4 [95% Cl: 63, 81] to 81% + 4 [95% Cl: 73, 88], none of these increases reached statistical significance when evaluated individually (see Figure 4). Nonetheless, the consistency of the improvements across models suggests a robust and reproducible trend that favors agentic retrieval strategies in this deployment-friendly tier. 11 Table 3: Hallucination and relevance metrics for agentic responses on the RadioRAG dataset (n = 104). "Context relevant" was evaluated at the dataset level: each question was labeled as having relevant or irrelevant retrieved context, and the same label was applied across all models (48/104 questions were judged to have clinically appropriate context). “Hallucination” refers to incorrect model answers despite relevant context. “Correct despite irrelevant context” captures correct answers when the retrieved context was not clinically useful. The final column reports the percentage of questions that were incorrect in zero-shot prompting but answered correctly using the agentic framework. Percentages and raw counts are shown per model.

This allowed us to isolate the influence of model size from confounding variables such as instruction tuning or pretraining corpus. We computed Pearson correlation coefficients between model size and diagnostic accuracy for each inference strategy. All three methods including zero-shot (r = 0.68), traditional RAG (r = 0.81), and agentic RAG (r = 0.61) showed strong positive correlations with parameter count, reflecting the general performance advantage of larger models. However, as detailed in earlier findings, the relative benefit of retrieval strategies was not uniformly distributed: conventional RAG was most beneficial for small models, while agentic reasoning consistently enhanced performance in mid-sized models (see Figure 4). These findings highlight the importance of aligning retrieval strategies with model capacity and deployment constraints. 2.6. Agentic retrieval enhances performance in fine-tuned clinical models To examine whether domain-specific fine-tuning diminishes the utility of retrieval-based strategies, we evaluated four clinically optimized language models: MedGemma-27B-text-it, MedGemma-4B-it, Llama3-Med42-70B, and Llama3-Med42-8B. These models are specifically fine-tuned for biomedical or radiological applications, making them suitable test cases for understanding the complementary role of agentic retrieval and reasoning. Despite already possessing clinical specialization, all four models exhibited improved diagnostic QA performance under the agentic framework. On average, accuracy increased from 67% + 6 under zero-shot prompting to 75% + 6 with agentic RAG (P = 0.001). Traditional online RAG, in contrast, did not show a significant improvement over zero-shot prompting (67% + 9 vs. 67% + 6, P = 0.704). Notably, agentic RAG also significantly outperformed traditional online RAG (P = 0.034), suggesting that structured multi-step reasoning contributes meaningfully even when baseline knowledge is embedded through fine-tuning. Each model in this group followed a similar pattern. For instance, MedGemma-27B-text-it improved from 71% + 4 [95% Cl: 62, 79] to 81% + 4 [95% Cl: 73, 88] with agentic inference, MedGemma-4B-it from 56% + 5 [95% Cl: 46, 65] to 66% + 5 [95% Cl: 57, 75], Llama3-Med42-70B from 72% + 4 [95% Cl: 63, 80] to 79% + 4 [95% Cl: 71, 87], and Llama3-Med42-8B from 67% + 5 [95% Cl: 58, 77] to 75% + 4 [95% Cl: 66, 84] (see Figure 4). While these individual gains were not statistically significant on their own, the collective improvement supports the hypothesis that retrieval-augmented reasoning provides additive benefits beyond those conferred by fine-tuning alone. These results suggest that domain-specific fine-tuning and agentic reasoning serve complementary roles: fine-tuning equips the model with foundational knowledge, while the agentic framework enhances factual grounding, synthesis, and contextual accuracy through structured information-seeking behavior. 13 a Small models b Large models [PHONE] 90 * oot | T § : . — 70 . : _ 7+. i t . 30 1 30 20 Qwen Uama Qwen Qwen Ministral Gemma Qwen 20 03 DeepSeek GPT DeepSeek 3-8B 3.3-8B 25-78 25-38 -8B -3-4B-it 25-0.5B -RI -4-turbo -v3 c Mid-sized models d Qwen models (size effect) 100 80 90; + 7 . i i 70 5 |? i 7 7 & 60+ } . 8 507 . . 40+ 40 307 0~ 30 053 7 14 70 DeepSeek Mistral Qwen Gemma- GPT -RI-70B Large 2.5-70B 3-27B-it -3.5-turbo Model size (billions of parameters) e Fine-tuned models f Response time a -" ae Accuracy [%] 2 g Figure 4.

Agentic retrieval increases response time but remains computationally tractable To evaluate the computational impact of agentic reasoning, we measured and compared per- question response times between zero-shot prompting and agentic RAG across all models using the RadioRAG benchmark. As shown in Table 4, agentic retrieval introduced a substantial latency overhead across all model groups, with the average response time increasing from 54 + 28 seconds under zero-shot prompting to 324 + 270 seconds under agentic inference, equivalent to a 6.71 increase. As shown in Figure 4, this increase varied considerably by model group. Small-scale models (7-8B parameters), including Qwen 2.5-7B, Qwen3-8B, Llama3-Med42-8B, Llama3- Med42-8B, and Ministral-8B, showed a 6.04 average increase, with individual models ranging from modest (2.06* for Qwen3-8B) to substantial (35.98* for Qwen 2.5-7B). Mini models (3-4B parameters), such as Gemma-3-4B-it, MedGemma-4B-it, and Qwen 2.5-3B, exhibited the highest relative increase, averaging 11.10x, with Qwen2.5-3B peaking at 18.59x. In contrast, mid-sized models (~70B parameters), including DeepSeek-R1-70B, Llama-3.3-70B, Qwen 2.5-70B, and Llama3-Med42-70B, had a more moderate increase of 2.93x. This reflects a balance between computational capacity and the overhead introduced by iterative reasoning. For example, DeepSeek-R1-70B showed only a 1.87 increase. The large-model group (120—250B), including Qwen 3-235B, Mistral Large, and Llama4 Scout 16E, had the largest absolute latency, with a group average increase of 13.27x. Qwen3-235B showed the most pronounced jump, from 97 seconds to 1703 seconds per question. Despite high computational costs, these models showed only minimal diagnostic improvement with agentic reasoning, emphasizing a potential efficiency— performance trade-off. Notably, the DeepSeek mixture of experts*? (MoE) group (DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3) exhibited relatively efficient scaling under agentic reasoning, with an average increase of 4.19x, suggesting that sparsely activated architectures may offer runtime advantages in multi-step retrieval tasks. Similarly, the Gemma-27B group (Gemma-3-27B-it and MedGemma- 27B-text-it) demonstrated a low variance and consistent response time increase of 2.82x, indicating reliable timing behavior under agentic workflows. Despite these increases, the absolute response times remained within feasible limits for many clinical applications. Furthermore, because evaluations were conducted under identical system conditions, the relative timing metrics provide a robust measure of computational scaling. These findings suggest that while the agentic RAG introduces additional latency, its time cost may be acceptable, especially in mid-sized and sparse-activation models depending on deployment requirements and accuracy demands. 15 Table 4: Response time comparison between zero-shot and the agentic method across model groups. Average per-question response times (n = 104) are reported in seconds as mean + standard deviation for both individual models and aggregated model groups. A fixed overhead of 10,554.64 seconds per model, corresponding to context generation, was evenly distributed across all questions, contributing approximately 101.5 seconds per question. For time analysis, models were grouped based on parameter scale and architectural characteristics into six categories: the DeepSeek mixture of experts (MoE) group, the large model group (120—250B), the medium-scale group (~70B), the Gemma-27B group, the small model group (7—8B), and the mini model group (3-4B). “Absolute difference” denotes the increase in average response time per question introduced by the agentic method, and “Relative increase” refers to the ratio of mean agentic time to mean zero-shot time per group. Final statistics are computed at the group level.

Agentic retrieval provides human-interpretable context and enables performance gains for expert radiologists To better understand the source of diagnostic improvements conferred by the agentic framework, we conducted an additional experiment involving a board-certified radiologist (TTN) with seven years of experience in diagnostic and interventional radiology. As in previous evaluations, the expert first answered all 104 RadioRAG questions unaided, i.e., without access to external references or retrieval assistance, achieving an accuracy of 51% + 5 [95% Cl: 41, 62] (53/104). This baseline performance was significantly lower than that of 16 out of 24 evaluated LLMs in their zero-shot mode (P s 0.017 for all), and not significantly different from 7 models, including GPT-3.5-turbo, Llama3.3-8B, Qwen 2.5-7B, Ministral-8B, MedGemma-4B-it, Gemma-3-4B-it, and Qwen 2.5-3B. Only Qwen 2.5-0.5B, the smallest model tested, performed significantly inferior to the radiologist (37% + 5 [95% Cl: 27, 46]; P = 0.044). To isolate the contribution of retrieval independent of generative reasoning, we repeated the experiment with the same radiologist using the contextual reports retrieved by the agentic system, that is, the same Radiopaedia content supplied to the LLMs. With access to this structured evidence, the radiologist’s accuracy increased to 68% + 5 [95% Cl: 60, 77] (71/104), a significant improvement over the unaided baseline (P = 0.010). This finding demonstrates that the agentic system successfully retrieves clinically meaningful and decision-relevant information, which can support human diagnostic accuracy even in the absence of language model synthesis. When comparing the radiologist’s context-assisted performance to that of the LLMs, only 1 out of 24 models significantly outperformed the radiologist under zero-shot conditions (03; P=0.018). In contrast, when compared to LLM performance under the full agentic framework, only 2 models, i.e., DeepSeek-V3 (P = 0.016) and 03 (P = 0.012) achieved statistically significant improvements over the context-assisted radiologist. 3. Discussion In this study, we introduced an agentic RAG framework designed to enhance the performance, factual grounding, and clinical reliability of LLMs in radiology QA tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of an agentic retrieval method in radiology, and our large- scale evaluation across 24 diverse LLMs, including different architectures, parameter scales, training paradigms, and clinical fine-tuning, represents one of the most comprehensive comparative analysis of its kind to date**. Our findings indicate that agentic retrieval can improve diagnostic accuracy relative to conventional zero-shot prompting and _ traditional RAG approaches, especially in small- to mid-sized models, while also reducing hallucinated outputs. However, the benefits of agentic retrieval were not uniformly observed across all models or scenarios, underscoring the need for careful consideration of model scale and characteristics when deploying retrieval-based systems. 17 A central finding of this study is that the effectiveness of retrieval strategies strongly depends on model scale. While traditional single-step online RAG***?', and generally non- agentic RAG"®'74546 approaches have previously been shown to primarily benefit smaller models (<8 billion parameters) with diminishing returns at larger scales'®'®2', our agentic framework expanded performance improvements into the mid-sized model range (approximately 17—150 billion parameters). Mid-sized models such as GPT-3.5-turbo, Mistral Large, and Llama3.3-70B have sufficient reasoning capabilities to follow structured logic but frequently struggle to independently identify and incorporate relevant external clinical evidence. By decomposing complex clinical questions into structured subtasks and iteratively retrieving targeted evidence, the agentic approach consistently improved accuracy across these mid-sized models, gains that conventional RAG did not achieve in this important segment. Similarly, smaller models also benefited from structured retrieval, overcoming some limitations associated with fewer parameters and less comprehensive pretraining. However, the magnitude of improvements varied between individual small-scale models, likely reflecting differences in architectural design, instruction tuning, and pretraining data. These results suggest that while agentic retrieval can broadly enhance performance across smaller and mid-sized models, model-specific optimizations may be required to fully capitalize on its potential. In contrast, the largest evaluated models (more than 200 billion parameters), such as GPT-4-turbo, 03, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen 3-235B exhibited minimal to no gains from either conventional or agentic retrieval methods. These models achieved high performance with zero- shot inference alone, suggesting that their extensive pretraining on large-scale and potentially clinically relevant data already equipped them with substantial internal reasoning capabilities and domain-specific knowledge. While retrieval augmentation offered limited incremental accuracy benefits at this scale, it may still provide value in clinical practice by enhancing transparency, auditability, and alignment with established documentation standards. Future studies should explore whether agentic retrieval can improve interpretability and traceability of decisions made by these high-capacity models, even when accuracy alone does not increase significantly. To further examine the relationship between model scale and retrieval benefit, we conducted a controlled scaling analysis using the Qwen 2.5 model family. This approach, which held architecture and training constant, revealed a strong positive relationship between model size and diagnostic accuracy across all tested inference strategies*”*®. Nevertheless, the optimal retrieval approach varied: traditional single-step RAG offered the greatest advantage for smaller models, whereas agentic retrieval consistently enhanced mid-sized model performance. These results highlight the importance of aligning retrieval strategies with the intrinsic reasoning capacity of individual models, emphasizing tailored rather than universal implementation of retrieval augmentation. A key consideration in clinical applications is whether domain-specific fine-tuning reduces the necessity or utility of external retrieval. Clinically specialized LLMs, such as variants of MedGemma and Llama3-Med42, are increasingly available and presumed to contain embedded medical knowledge sufficient for diagnostic tasks®. However, our results show that even these fine-tuned models consistently benefited from agentic retrieval, whereas traditional single-step RAG provided little additional improvement. The additive benefit of agentic retrieval in fine-tuned models suggests that structured, case-specific external evidence complements internal 18 knowledge by providing context-sensitive, up-to-date information. Thus, agentic retrieval and clinical fine-tuning should be viewed as complementary strategies, jointly optimizing model performance and reliability rather than being seen as mutually exclusive. Beyond accuracy, our analysis demonstrated that agentic retrieval improved factual grounding®"* and reduced hallucinations in model outputs. By systematically associating diagnostic responses with specific retrieved content from Radiopaedia.org'®, the framework promoted evidence-based reasoning, which is critical in safety-sensitive applications like radiology. Although clinically relevant evidence was retrieved in less than half of the evaluated cases, most models successfully leveraged this content to produce factually correct responses when it was available. Larger and clinically tuned models demonstrated robustness by correctly responding even when retrieved evidence was irrelevant or insufficient, likely relying on internal knowledge’®. However, such internally derived answers, while accurate, lack explicit grounding in external sources, raising potential concerns for interpretability and clinical accountability*’. Smaller models were less resilient when retrieval failed, highlighting their greater reliance on structured external support. Consequently, ensuring high-quality retrieval remains paramount, especially for deployment scenarios where transparency and traceability of decisions are required. The increased diagnostic reliability introduced by agentic retrieval came at a computational cost. Response times significantly increased compared to zero-shot inference due to iterative query refinement, structured evidence gathering, and multi-agent coordination. This latency varied substantially by model size and architecture, with smaller models experiencing the largest relative increases, and mid-sized or sparsely activated architectures demonstrating comparatively moderate overhead. Very large models, although capable of achieving high accuracy without retrieval, experienced substantial absolute latency increases without commensurate accuracy gains. Future work should therefore explore optimization strategies to manage computational overhead, such as selective retrieval triggering, parallel evidence pipelines, or methods to distill agentic reasoning into more efficient inference paths. Furthermore, agentic retrieval demonstrated value as a decision-support tool for human experts. Providing a board-certified radiologist with the same retrieved context as the agentic system substantially improved their diagnostic accuracy compared to unaided performance. This finding illustrates that the agentic retrieval process successfully identified and presented clinically meaningful, decision-relevant evidence that directly supported expert reasoning. The limited number of LLMs significantly outperforming the context-assisted radiologist further underscores the complementary strengths of human expertise and agentically retrieved information. Thus, agentic retrieval may serve dual purposes in clinical environments, simultaneously enhancing LLM performance and providing interpretable, actionable evidence to clinicians. Our study has several important limitations. First, our evaluation relied exclusively on Radiopaedia.org, a trusted but singular radiology knowledge source. Dependence on a single data provider can restrict retrieval coverage and may not represent the full breadth of available radiological information. Incorporating multiple authoritative sources, structured knowledge bases, or clinical ontologies could improve the generalizability and relevance of retrieved content. Second, although rigorous, our benchmark dataset comprised a relatively limited number of 19 expert-curated radiology questions (n=104). While these questions spanned diverse subspecialties and were carefully constructed, larger and more varied datasets encompassing broader clinical scenarios, different imaging modalities, and increased diagnostic complexity are required to fully assess the robustness and effectiveness of agentic retrieval frameworks. Third, the agentic retrieval process incurs significant computational overhead, substantially increasing response times compared to conventional zero-shot prompting and traditional single-step RAG. Although response durations remained within feasible limits for non-emergent clinical use cases, the practicality of the proposed method in time-sensitive settings (e.g., acute diagnostic workflows) remains uncertain. Future research should explore optimization techniques, such as parallelization or selective agent activation, to mitigate latency without sacrificing diagnostic accuracy or reasoning quality. Fourth, our evaluation relied on retrospective, static radiology QA items drawn from the recently published RSNA-RadioQA and ExtendedQA datasets. These datasets were curated and released shortly before our study, lowering the likelihood that included items appeared in model pretraining. However, despite their clinical rigor, such benchmark-style questions do not fully capture the complexity of real-world radiology workflows, which often involve evolving diagnostic contexts, iterative communication, and integration of multimodal imaging data. Our results therefore reflect performance in a controlled QA setting rather than in live clinical environments. Future work should evaluate agentic retrieval under prospective, clinically embedded conditions, such as within reporting workflows or decision support systems to better understand its utility in practice. Fifth, despite evaluating a broad range of LLM architectures, parameter scales, and training paradigms, we observed substantial variability in the diagnostic gains attributable to agentic retrieval across individual models. This likely reflects a combination of factors, including architectural differences, instruction tuning approaches, and pretraining data composition, as well as implementation-specific elements such as prompt design and agent orchestration. Because the agentic pipeline relies on structured prompting and task decomposition, its performance may be sensitive to changes in phrasing, retrieval heuristics, or agent coordination. Future work should systematically investigate both model-level and implementation-level sources of variability to develop more robust, generalizable retrieval strategies tailored to different model configurations. This study presents a proof-of-concept for an agentic retrieval framework capable of enhancing diagnostic accuracy, factual reliability, and clinical interpretability of LLMs in radiology QA tasks. Our extensive, large-scale analysis of 24 diverse models highlights the complex relationships between retrieval strategy, model scale, and clinical fine-tuning. While agentic retrieval shows clear promise, particularly for mid-sized and clinically optimized models, future research is essential to refine retrieval mechanisms, mitigate computational overhead, and validate these systems across broader clinical contexts. As generative Al continues to integrate into medical practice, frameworks emphasizing transparency, evidence-based reasoning, and human-aligned interpretability, such as the agentic approach introduced here, will become increasingly critical for trustworthy and effective clinical decision support. 20 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Ethics statement The methods were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. The data utilized in this research was sourced from previously published studies. As the study did not involve human subjects or patients, it was exempt from institutional review board approval and did not require informed consent. 4.2. Dataset This study utilized a combination of two carefully curated datasets specifically designed to evaluate the performance of agentic LLMs in retrieval-augmented radiology QA. We utilized two previously published datasets from the RadioRAG study"®: the RSNA- RadioQA" and ExtendedQA"* datasets. The RSNA-RadioQA dataset consists of 80 radiology questions derived from peer-reviewed cases available in the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) Case Collection. This dataset covers 18 radiologic subspecialties, including breast imaging, chest radiology, gastrointestinal imaging, musculoskeletal imaging, neuroradiology, and pediatric radiology, among others. Each subspecialty contains at least five questions, carefully crafted from clinical histories and imaging descriptions provided in the original RSNA case documentation. Differential diagnoses explicitly listed by original case authors were excluded to avoid biasing model responses. Images were intentionally excluded. Detailed characteristics, including patient demographics and subspecialty distributions, have been previously published and are publicly accessible. The ExtendedQA dataset consists of 24 unique, radiology-specific questions initially developed and validated by board-certified radiologists with substantial diagnostic radiology experience (5—14 years). These questions reflect realistic clinical diagnostic scenarios not previously available online or included in Known LLM training datasets. The final RadioRAG dataset used in this study subsequently contains 104 questions combining both RSNA-RadioQA and ExtendedQA. 4.2.1. Dataset postprocessing To ensure consistent evaluation across all models and inference strategies, we applied structured preprocessing to the original RadioRAG dataset, particularly the ExtendedQA portion (n=24), which was initially formatted as open-ended questions. All questions from the RSNA-RadioQA dataset (n=80) were left unchanged. However, for the ExtendedQA subset, each question was first converted into a multiple-choice format while preserving the original stem and correct answer. To standardize the evaluation across both RSNA-RadioQA and ExtendedQA, we then generated three high-quality distractor options for 21 every question in the dataset (n = 104), resulting in a total of four answer choices per item. Distractors were generated using OpenAl’s GPT-40 and 03 models, selected for their ability to produce clinically plausible and contextually challenging alternatives. Prompts were designed to elicit difficult distractors, including common misconceptions, closely related entities, or synonyms of the correct answer. This ensured that diagnostic complexity was maintained across all questions. A representative prompt used for distractor generation was: “I have a dataset of radiology questions that are currently open-ended, each with a correct answer provided. | want to transform these into multiple-choice questions (MCQs) by generating four answer options per question (one correct answer + three distractors). The distractors should be plausible and the level of difficulty must be high. If possible, include distractors that are synonyms, closely related concepts, or common misconceptions related to the correct answer.” Supplementary Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the datasets used in this study. The original RSNA-RadioQA questions are publicly available through their original publication’®. 4.3. Experimental Design 4.3.1. System architecture The experimental design centers on an agentic retrieval and reasoning framework adapted from LangChain’s Open Deep Research pipeline, specifically tailored for radiology QA tasks. As illustrated in Figure 1, the pipeline employs a structured, multi-agent workflow designed to produce comprehensive, evidence-based diagnostic reports for each multiple-choice question. The reasoning and content-generation process is powered by OpenAl’s GPT-40-mini model, selected for its proficiency in complex reasoning tasks, robust instruction-following, and effective tool utilization. The architecture consists of two specialized agents: (i) a supervisor agent and (ii) a research agent, coordinated through a stateful directed graph framework. State management within this directed graph framework ensures that all steps in the workflow remain consistent and coordinated. The system maintains a shared memory state, recording the research plan, retrieved evidence, completed drafts, and all agent interactions, enabling structured progression from planning through final synthesis. 4.3.2. Agentic preprocessing To enable structured, multi-step reasoning in the agentic retrieval framework, we implemented a preprocessing step focused on diagnostic abstraction. For each question in the RadioRAG dataset, we used the Mistral Large model to generate a concise, comma-separated summary of key clinical concepts. This step was designed to extract the essential diagnostic elements of each question while filtering out rhetorical structure, instructional phrasing (e.g., “What is the most likely 22 diagnosis?”), and other non-clinical language. These keyword summaries served exclusively as internal inputs to guide the agentic system’s retrieval process and were not shown to the LLMs as part of the actual question content. The intent was to ensure retrieval was driven by the clinical essence of the question rather than superficial linguistic cues. The prompt used for keyword extraction was: “Extract and summarize the key Clinical details from the following radiology question. Provide a concise, comma-separated summary of keywords and key phrases in one sentence only. Question: {question_text}. Summary.” 4.3.3. Agent roles and responsibilities The workflow is coordinated primarily by two agents, each with distinct responsibilities: (i) supervisor agent and (ii) research agent. The supervisor acts as the central orchestrator of the pipeline. Upon receiving a question, the supervisor reviews the diagnostic keywords and multiple- choice options, then formulates a structured research plan dividing the task into clearly defined sections, one for each diagnostic option. This agent assigns tasks to individual research agents, each responsible for exploring a single diagnostic choice. Throughout the process, the supervisor ensures strict neutrality, focusing solely on evidence gathering rather than advocating for any particular option. After research agents complete their tasks, the supervisor synthesizes their outputs into a final report, utilizing specialized tools to generate an objective introduction and conclusion. Each research agent independently conducts an in-depth analysis focused on one diagnostic option. Beginning with a clear directive from the supervisor, the research agent employs a structured retrieval strategy to obtain relevant evidence. This involves an initial focused query using only essential terms from the diagnostic option, followed by contextual queries combining these terms with clinical features from the question stem (e.g., imaging findings or patient demographics). If retrieval results are inadequate, the agent adaptively refines queries by simplifying terms or substituting synonyms. In cases where sufficient evidence is not available after four attempts, the agent explicitly documents this limitation. All retrieval tasks utilize Radiopaedia.org exclusively, ensuring clinical accuracy and reliability. After completing retrieval, the research agent synthesizes findings into a structured report segment, explicitly highlighting both supporting and contradicting evidence. Each segment includes clearly formatted citations linking directly to source materials, ensuring transparency and verifiability. 4.3.4. Retrieval and writing tools To facilitate structured retrieval and writing processes, the pipeline utilizes a suite of specialized computational tools dynamically selected based on specific task requirements: (i) search tool, (ii) report structuring tools, and (iii) content generation tool. In the following, details of each tool is explained. 23 The retrieval mechanism is powered by a custom-built search tool leveraging a locally hosted instance of SearXNG, a privacy-oriented meta-search engine deployed within a containerized Docker environment. This setup ensures consistent and reproducible search results. To maintain quality and clinical reliability, the search tool restricts results exclusively to content from Radiopaedia.org through a two-layer filtering process: first by appending a “site:radiopaedia.org” clause to all queries, and subsequently by performing an explicit domain check on all retrieved results. Raw results are deduplicated and formatted into markdown bundles suitable for seamless integration into subsequent reasoning steps. The supervisor agent employs specific tools to structure the diagnostic report systematically. An initial Sections tool is used to outline the report into distinct diagnostic sections, aligning precisely with the multiple-choice options. Additional specialized tools generate standardized Introduction and Conclusion sections: the Introduction tool summarizes essential Clinical details from the question, and the Conclusion tool objectively synthesizes findings from all diagnostic sections, emphasizing comparative diagnostic considerations without bias. The research agent utilizes a dedicated Section writing tool to construct standardized report segments. Each segment begins with a concise synthesis of retrieved evidence, followed by interpretive summaries clearly identifying points supporting and contradicting each diagnostic choice. Citations are integrated inline, referencing specific Radiopaedia'® URLs for traceability. 4.3.5. Report assembly and persistence Upon completion of individual research segments, the supervisor agent compiles the final diagnostic report, verifying the completeness and quality of all sections. The resulting structured report, including introduction, detailed analysis of diagnostic options, and conclusion, is then immediately persisted in a robust manner. Reports are streamed incrementally into newline- delimited JSON (NDJSON) format, preventing data loss in case of interruptions. This storage method supports efficient resumption by checking previously completed entries, thus avoiding redundant processing. After processing all questions within a given batch, individual NDJSON entries are consolidated into a single comprehensive JSON file, facilitating downstream analysis and evaluation. 4.4. Baseline comparison systems Each model was evaluated under three configurations: (i) zero-shot prompting (conventional QA), (ii) traditional online RAG", and (iii) our proposed agentic retrieval framework. 4.4.1. Baseline 1: Zero-shot prompting pipeline In the zero-shot prompting baseline, models received no external retrieval assistance or context. Instead, each model was presented solely with the multiple-choice questions from the RadioRAG 24 dataset (question stem and four diagnostic options) and prompted to select the correct answer based entirely on their pre-trained knowledge. Models generated their responses autonomously without iterative feedback, reasoning prompts, or additional information. The exact standardized prompt used for this configuration is provided below: “You are a highly knowledgeable medical expert. Below is a multiple-choice radiology question. Read the question carefully. Provide the correct answer by selecting the most appropriate option from A, B, C, or D. Question: {question} Options: foptions}” 4.4.2. Baseline 2: Traditional online RAG pipeline The traditional online RAG baseline was implemented following a state-of-the-art non-agentic retrieval framework previously developed for radiology question answering by Arasteh et al’®. The system employs GPT-3.5-turbo to automatically extract up to five representative radiology keywords from each question, optimized experimentally to balance retrieval quality and efficiency. These keywords were used to retrieve relevant articles from Radiopaedia.org, with each article segmented into overlapping chunks of 1,000 tokens. Chunks were then converted into vector embeddings (OpenAl's text-embedding-ada-002) and stored in a temporary vector database. Subsequently, the embedded original question was compared against this database to retrieve the top three matching text chunks based on cosine similarity. These retrieved chunks served as external context provided to each LLM alongside the original multiple-choice question. Models were then instructed to answer concisely based solely on this context, explicitly stating if the answer was unknown. The exact standardized prompt used for this configuration is provided below: “You are a highly knowledgeable medical expert. Below is a multiple-choice radiology question accompanied by relevant context (report). First, read the report, and then the question carefully. Use the retrieved context to answer the question by selecting the most appropriate option from A, B, C, or D. Otherwise, if you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. Report: {report} Question: {question} Options: foptions}” 25 4.5. Evaluation SW, JS, TTN, and STA performed model evaluations. We assessed both small and large-scale LLMs using responses generated between July 1-27, 2025. For each of the 104 questions in the RadioRAG benchmark dataset, models were integrated into a unified evaluation pipeline to ensure consistent testing conditions across all settings. The evaluation included 24 LLMs: Ministral-8B, Mistral Large, Llama3.3-8B°"%°, Llama3.3-70B%’**, | Llama3-Med42-8B*, Llama3-Med42-70B*, Llama4 Scout 16E%, DeepSeek R1-70B*%, DeepSeek-R1°%, DeepSeek-V3*°, Qwen 2.5-0.5B**, Qwen 2.5-3B*, Qwen 2.5-7B*, Qwen 2.5-14B°%, Qwen 2.5-70B*?, Qwen 3-8B*°, Qwen 3-235B*°, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4-turbo®, 03, MedGemma-4B-it™, MedGemma-27B-text-it**, Gemma-3-4B-it*"4*, and Gemma-3-27B-it*!**. These models span a broad range of parameter scales (from 0.5B to over 670B), training paradigms (instruction-tuned, reasoning-optimized, clinically aligned, and general-purpose), and access models (open-source, open-weights, or proprietary). They also reflect architectural diversity, including dense transformers and MoE*’ systems. Full model specifications, including size, category, accessibility, knowledge cutoff date, context length, and developer are provided in Table 1. 4.5.1. Accuracy assessment Accuracy was determined by comparing each LLM's response to the correct option. We used Mistral Large as an automated adjudicator for this process. For each multiple-choice question, both the LLM's response and the correct answer (including its corresponding letter and option) were provided to Mistral Large via a standardized prompt. Mistral Large was instructed to respond "Yes" if the correct answer was present in the model's response, either explicitly or as a clear component of the explanation, even if the phrasing differed. Otherwise, it was instructed to respond "No." A "Yes" was scored as 1 (correct), and a"No" was scored as 0 (incorrect), ensuring a consistent and unbiased measure of diagnostic accuracy. The exact standardized prompt used for this configuration is provided below: “You are a highly knowledgeable medical expert. Determine whether the Correct Answer appears within the LLMs response, fully or as a clear part of the explanation, even if the wording differs. Respond with ‘Yes’ if the Correct Answer can be found in the LLMs response; otherwise respond with ‘No’. LLMs response: {llms_response} Correct Answer: {correct_answer}” 26 4.5.2. Factuality assessment To evaluate the factual reliability of model outputs under the agentic retrieval framework, we conducted a targeted hallucination analysis across all 104 questions in the RadioRAG benchmark’®. This analysis aimed to differentiate model errors due to flawed reasoning from those caused by insufficient or irrelevant evidence, and to assess the extent to which final answers were grounded in the retrieved context. Each agentic response was reviewed by a board-certified radiologist (TTN) with seven years of experience in diagnostic and interventional radiology. For every question, the following three criteria were assessed: (i) whether the retrieved Radiopaedia context was clinically relevant to the question, (ii) whether the model's final answer was consistent with that context, and (iii) whether the final answer was factually correct. Context was classified as clinically relevant only if it contained no incorrect or off-topic content with respect to the diagnostic question. This strict definition ensured that relevance was not based on superficial keyword overlap but on the actual clinical utility of the content. Retrievals were deemed relevant only when the retrieved material included appropriate imaging findings, clinical clues, or differential diagnoses applicable to the question stem. Hallucinations were defined as cases in which the model produced an incorrect answer despite being provided with clinically relevant context. These represent failures of reasoning or synthesis rather than of retrieval. Given the high-stakes nature of radiologic diagnosis, identifying such errors is essential for understanding model reliability and safety. We also documented instances where models answered questions correctly despite being supplied with irrelevant or unhelpful context. These “correct despite irrelevant context” cases reflect scenarios in which the model relied on internal knowledge rather than external grounding. While not classified as hallucinations, these responses raise questions about the transparency, traceability, and consistency of model behavior in the absence of meaningful retrieval. 4.5.3. Time analysis To evaluate the computational cost associated with agentic reasoning, we measured per-question response times for both zero-shot prompting and the agentic retrieval framework using the 104- question RadioRAG benchmark. Timing logs were collected from structured output directories for each model. A fixed initialization overhead of 10,554.6 seconds per model, arising from the context construction phase unique to agentic inference, was distributed uniformly across all questions, resulting in an adjusted time increase of approximately 101.5 seconds per question. To ensure robust comparison and mitigate the influence of extreme values, outlier durations were handled using the Tukey method®°. Specifically, any response time that exceeded the typical upper range, defined as values greater than the third quartile by more than 1.5 times the interquartile range, was considered an outlier and replaced with the mean of the remaining non-outlier values for that model and inference strategy. For each model, we computed the mean 27 and standard deviation of response times under both conditions. Additionally, we calculated the absolute difference in average response time per question and the relative increase, defined as the ratio of mean agentic response time to mean zero-shot response time. To contextualize timing behavior across a heterogeneous model set, we grouped models according to both parameter scale and architectural characteristics. This grouping approach reflected the practical computational load of each model more accurately than parameter count alone. Six distinct groups were defined: (i) the DeepSeek MoE group, including DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3; (ii) the large model group (120-250 billion parameters), including Qwen 3- 235B, Mistral Large, and Llama4 Scout 16E; (iii) the medium-scale group (~70B), comprising DeepSeek R1-70B, Llama3.3-70B, Qwen2.5-70B, and Llama3-Med42-70B; (iv) the Gemma-27B group, containing Gemma-3-27B-it and MedGemma-27B-text-it; (v) the small model group (7— 8B), including Qwen 2.5-70B, Qwen3-8B, Llama3-Med42-8B, Llama3.3-8B, and Ministral-8B; and (vi) the mini model group (3—4B), consisting of Gemma-3-4B-it, MedGemma-4B-it, and Qwen 2.5- 3B. Group-level averages and standard deviations were calculated across constituent models and are reported in Table 4. All timing evaluations were performed under identical system conditions to ensure fair comparisons. While absolute response times may vary with hardware and load, the relative increases provide a stable and interpretable metric for assessing the computational implications of agentic retrieval. 4.5.4. Human evaluation To benchmark LLM performance against domain expertise, we conducted a human evaluation involving a board-certified radiologist (TTN) with seven years of experience in diagnostic and interventional radiology. The evaluation followed a two-phase design to mirror the LLM configurations. In the first phase, the radiologist answered all 104 questions from the RadioRAG benchmark without any external assistance, analogous to zero-shot prompting. The expert was blinded to the LLM responses, dataset construction process, and reference standard answers. Responses were recorded as final, and no additional time or information resources were permitted during this phase. In the second phase, we aimed to isolate the contribution of the agentic retrieval component, independent of generative reasoning. For this, the same radiologist was provided with the contextual evidence retrieved by the agentic system for each question, the same Radiopaedia excerpts that were used as inputs for LLM agentic inference. The radiologist answered the same 104 questions again, this time using the retrieved context as decision support, without access to the original question-answer pairs or their previous responses. The format and presentation of the contextual evidence were identical to what the LLMs received during agentic inference, ensuring comparability. This design enabled us to disentangle the effects of information retrieval from language model reasoning, by comparing unaided radiologist performance, radiologist performance with 28 context, and agentic LLM outputs under standardized conditions. Accuracy was computed using the same evaluation criteria applied to LLMs. Statistical comparisons between human and model responses were performed using McNemar’s test on paired question-level outcomes. Confidence intervals and p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate. 4.6. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using Python v3.11 with SciPy v1.10, NumPy v1.25.2, and statsmodels v0.14.5 packages. For each dataset, bootstrapping with 1,000 redraws was used to estimate means, standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals (Cl)*". A strictly paired design ensured identical redraws across conditions’. To assess statistical significance of pairwise method comparisons across all LLMs, exact McNemar's test® (based on the binomial distribution) was applied to each model individually. Resulting p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate, with a significance threshold of 0.05. For group-level comparisons between inference strategies (e.g., zero-shot vs. agentic RAG), paired two tailed t- tests were used to compare average accuracy across models. To explore the relationship between model size and performance, Pearson correlation coefficients were computed between parameter counts and accuracy values within the Qwen 2.5 model family, separately for each inference strategy. 4.7. Data availability All data are available via either the original RadioRAG publication’®. 4.8. Code availability All source code, configurations, and parameters used in this work are publicly available. The agentic RAG pipeline, developed in Python 3.11, is available at: https://github.com/sopajeta/agentic-rag. Our implementation relies on several key frameworks and tools. We used LangChain Open Deep Research (https://github.com/langchain-ai/deep- research) for experimental agent modules, LangChain v0.3.25 (https://github.com/langchain- ai/langchain) for orchestration and agent management, and LangGraph_ v0.4.1 (https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) to support multi-step control flow and_ task decomposition. Model access and embedding generation were handled via the OpenAl Python SDK _v1.77.0 — (https://platform.openai.com). The SearxNG metasearch — engine (https://github.com/searxng/searxng) was also deployed via Docker v25.0.2 (https://www.docker.com) and used for online web retrieval. 29 The traditional online RAG pipeline is hosted at https://github.com/tayebiarasteh/RadioRAG, which relies on the LangChain v0.1.0, Chroma (https://www.trychroma.com) for vector storage, and the OpenAl API v1.12 for embeddings.

Hardware For the majority of experiments, particularly those involving standard LLMs, the computations were performed on GPU nodes equipped with Nvidia H100 and H200 accelerators. The H100 configuration consisted of four Nvidia H100 GPUs, each providing 94 GB of HBM2e memory and operating at a 500 W powerlimit. These GPUs were paired with two AMD EPYC 9554 “Genoa” processors based on the Zen 4 architecture, each offering 64 high-performance cores running at 3.1 GHz. The H200 configuration featured four Nvidia H200 GPUs, each offering 141 GB of high-bandwidth memory also at 500 W, coupled to the same dual AMD EPYC 9554 processor configuration. This combination of high-end Nvidia accelerators from NHR@FAU’s Helma Cluster 30 (https://doc.nhr.fau.de/clusters/helma/) provided the necessary computational capabilities for inferencing the majority of the LLMs used during our experiments. Experiments involving extremely large-scale architectures, such as the DeepSeek R1 or V3 model and other similarly demanding workloads, were executed on nodes equipped with AMD’s MI300-series accelerators. In these cases, the MI300X configuration was utilized, which combined a dual-socket AMD EPYC 9474F platform with a total of 96 CPU cores and 2304 GiB of DDR5-5600 system memory, together with eight AMD Instinct MI300X accelerators. Each MI300X GPU offered 192 GiB of memory, enabling inference runs that required massive parameter counts and exceptional memory capacity (Deepseek R1 with 671 billion parameters). Additional experimentation also leveraged AMD Instinct MI300A nodes that integrate 24-core CPUs with unified on-package memory, with a total of 512 GiB shared across four accelerators. The hardware used in our experiments included a local machine with an Intel Pentium CPU with 2 cores and 8 GB Memory for consuming API endpoints. 5. Additional information 5.1.

Full answers generated by GPT-3.5-turbo using the agentic framework for the first two questions of the RSNA-RadioQA dataset, along with the most relevant sources retrieved from Radiopaedia. Responses illustrate the model’s reasoning and evidence grounding within the agentic pipeline. Question identifier LLM’s (GPT-3.5-turbo) answer Most relevant sources A: BI-RADS 4 - Suspicious abnormality requiring biopsy: BI-RADS 4 lesions are characterized by suspicious findings with an intermediate risk of malignancy. The presence of rim calcifications within a fat-containing mass raises concern for malignancy. Biopsy is generally recommended for BI-RADS 4 lesions, especially if calcifications are suspicious. B: BI-RADS 2 - Rim Calcifications: ps://radiopaedia.org/articles/breast-imaging- Rim calcifications in fat-containing masses are typically benign and classified as BI-RADS 2. These | reporting-and-data-system-bi-rads-assessment- calcifications are often associated with benign processes like fat necrosis or oil cysts. The imaging ategory-4, https://radiopaedia.org/cases/suspicious- features of a round, circumscribed fat-containing mass with rim calcifications align with a benign reast-calcifications-bi-rads-4, diagnosis. C: BI-RADS 3 - Probably benign finding: BI-RADS 3 category is designated for probably ps://radiopaedia.org/articles/fat-containing-breast- benign lesions with a low likelihood of malignancy. Fat-containing lesions with rim calcifications | lesions, https://radiopaedia.org/articles/breast- may fall into this category if they demonstrate typical benign features. Short-interval follow-up is alcifications, recommended for BI-RADS 3 lesions to monitor for any interval changes. D: Oil cyst secondary to ps://radiopaedia.org/cases/screening- fat necrosis: Oil cysts are benign lesions resulting from fat necrosis, often following trauma or ammography-rim-calcifications, surgery. These cysts typically present as fat-containing masses with rim calcifications, consistent ps://radiopaedia.org/articles/breast-imaging- with the imaging findings described. The absence of a clear history of trauma or surgery does not | reporting-and-data-system-bi-rads-assessment- exclude the possibility of an oil cyst. Conclude with a Final Answer: Based on the detailed analysis ategory-2, https://radiopaedia.org/cases/breast- of the imaging findings and the differential diagnosis provided in the report, the most likely diagnosis alcification-bi-rads-2, for the 66-year-old female with a palpable right breast lump at 10 o'clock, characterized by a round, ps://radiopaedia.org/articles/breast-imaging- circumscribed fat-containing mass with rim calcifications on mammography, is: D: Oil cyst | reporting-and-data-system-bi-rads-assessment- secondary to fat necrosis. Reasoning: The presence of a round, circumscribed fat-containing mass ategory-3, https://radiopaedia.org/articles/fat- with rim calcifications in the absence of a clear history of trauma or surgery aligns with the typical | necrosis-breast-2, imaging features of an oil cyst secondary to fat necrosis. Oil cysts are benign lesions associated ps://radiopaedia.org/articles/breast-imaging- with fat necrosis and are characterized by the presence of fat within the lesion and rim calcifications porting-and-data-system-bi-rads-2, on mammography. This diagnosis is further supported by the benign nature of rim calcifications in ps://radiopaedia.org/articles/oil-cyst-breast fat-containing masses, typically classified as BI-RADS 2. Therefore, considering the imaging findings and clinical context, the most likely explanation for the palpable abnormality in this case is an oil cyst secondary to fat necrosis. RSNA-RadioQA-Q11 A: Low-grade fibrosarcoma: Low-grade fibrosarcoma is a rare malignant mesenchymal tumor characterized by spindle cell morphology with a herringbone pattern. Immunohistochemical markers for fibrosarcoma often include vimentin positivity, but specific markers can vary. Beta- catenin nuclear staining is typically absent in fibrosarcomas, which helps differentiate them from other entities. The absence of nuclear beta-catenin staining in the presented case suggests low- grade fibrosarcoma is less likely. B: Phyllodes tumor: Phyllodes tumors are rare fibroepithelial breast tumors with a biphasic pattern of epithelial and spindle cell stromal components. Beta- catenin staining may show nuclear positivity in some cases, reflecting Wnt pathway activation. The clinical presentation of a rapidly growing breast mass in adult women aligns with the patient's | https://radiopaedia.org/articles/fibrosarcoma-of-the- characteristics. The presence of spindle cells with nuclear beta-catenin staining in the presented | breast, https://radiopaedia.org/cases/breast-sarcoma- case supports the possibility of a phyllodes tumor. C: Metaplastic carcinoma: Metaplastic | 2?lang=gb, https://radiopaedia.org/articles/phyllodes- carcinoma is a rare primary breast malignancy with both epithelial and mesenchymal | tumour-1, https://radiopaedia.org/articles/metaplastic- RSNA-RadioQA-Q2 components.Beta-catenin expression patterns may show aberrant nuclear localization, associated | breast-carcinoma, with Wnt signaling pathway activation. The patient's history of prior radiation exposure aligns with | https://radiopaedia.org/cases/metaplastic-carcinoma- a potential risk factor for metaplastic carcinoma.\n- The spindle cell morphology and nuclear beta- | breast, https://radiopaedia.org/articles/fibromatosis- catenin staining in the presented case could be consistent with metaplastic carcinoma. D: Breast | of-the-breast, https://radiopaedia.org/cases/desmoid- fibromatosis: Breast fibromatosis is a rare benign but locally aggressive tumor characterized by | fibromatosis-of-the-breast spindle cell proliferation and strong nuclear beta-catenin staining.Clinical association with prior radiation exposure matches the patient's history. The spindle cell morphology and nuclear beta- catenin staining in the presented case are in line with breast fibromatosis. Final Answer: D: Breast fibromatosis. Summary of Reasoning: Considering the patient's high risk of breast malignancy due to BRIP1 mutation and prior radiation exposure, the presence of spindle cells with nuclear beta- catenin staining in the breast mass suggests a diagnosis of breast fibromatosis. This rare tumor entity aligns with the clinical presentation, histopathological findings, and the patient's medical history, making it the most likely diagnosis in this case. 36 Supplementary Table 3: Zero-shot responses from GPT-3.5-turbo on the first 20 questions of the RSNA- RadioQA dataset.

2508 .0074I1v1 [cs.CL] 1 Aug 2025 arXiv Out-of-Context Abduction: LLMs Make Inferences About Procedural Data Leveraging Declarative Facts in Earlier Training Data Sohaib Imran!” [EMAIL].uk Abstract Large language models (LLMs) are trained on large corpora, yet it is unclear whether they can rea- son about the information present within their training data. We design experiments to study out-of-context abduction in LLMs, the ability to infer the most plausi- ble explanations for observations using relevant facts present in training data. We train treatment LLMs on names and behavior descriptions of fictitious chatbots, but not on examples of dialogue with the chatbots. We find that OpenAI’s GPT 40 LLM can correctly infer at least one chatbot’s name after observing example responses characteristic of that chatbot. We also find that previously training GPT 40 on descriptions of a chatbot’s behavior allows it to display behaviors more characteristic of the chatbot when iteratively trained to display such behaviors. Our results have implications for situational awareness in LLMs and, therefore, for Al safety. 1 Introduction With the recent popularity of large language models (LLMs), much research has been dedicated to evaluate their reasoning capabilities (Huang & Chang 2023, Webb et al. 2023, Lee et al. 2025). However, research on the subject has yet to show conclusively that LLMs can reason, partly due to inconsistent findings and varied ‘Lancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster University, Lancaster LAI 4YQ, UK School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA] 4WA, UK 3JBA Trust, 1 Broughton Park, Skipton BD23 3FD, UK 4Geography and Environmental Science, University of Southampton, Highfield, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK >College of Surveying and Geo-Informatics, Tongji University, No.1239, Siping Road, Shanghai, PR China, 200092 Rob Lamb!* Peter M. Atkinson! *° [EMAIL].uk interpretations of similar results (Mirzadeh et al. 2024, Wu et al. 2024). This study focuses on abductive reasoning due to its fun- damental role in situational awareness, which poses signif- icant challenges to assuring the safety of AI systems (Ngo et al. 2023). Abductive reasoning, often referred to as "inference to the best explanation" is the process of inferring the most likely hypothesis that explains some observations. The functional form of abduction is A->B B A where A is one of the hypotheses that explain the observa- tion B. Note that observing B does not necessarily entail A, but merely increases the likelihood of A. For example, if a lawn is wet one could infer rain, but if it is a dry day and a sprinkler is present then a more likely hypothesis is that the sprinkler was used. Abduction has two interpretations. The weak interpretation views it only as a mechanism for generating plausible hy- potheses for observations without assessing the likelihood of the hypotheses. In contrast, the strong interpretation posits abduction’s role as justificatory, that is, inferring or selecting the best hypothesis that explain the observations (Niiniluoto 1999, Calzavarini & Cevolani 2022). LLMs are capable of weak abductive inference, i.e., gener- ating plausible hypotheses to explain observations present in their context window (Balepur et al. 2024, Shi et al. 2024, Zhao et al. 2024). Furthermore, LLMs are capa- ble of strong in-context abductive inference i.e. selecting the most plausible hypothesis where both the observations and candidate hypotheses are presented in their context window (Bhagavatula et al. 2019, Bang et al. 2023). Out-of-Context Abduction However, it is difficult to delineate whether these capabili- ties result from reasoning or simply pattern matching to im- itate human reasoning (Shanahan et al. 2023, McCoy et al. 2024, Wu et al. 2024). We investigate the ability of LLMs to perform strong out-of-context abduction—inferring the most plausible explanations for observations by leveraging relevant facts learned during training. Our setup prevents simple imitation of human response patterns to masquerade as reasoning by: 1. Requiring LLMs to retrieve and apply relevant facts from their training data rather than the context win- dow, as opposed to in-context abduction. 2. Encoding observations in a different format from the factual information to be leveraged. The factual in- formation is declarative (abstract descriptions) and the observations are procedural (example instances or demonstrations). 2 Problem Definition Let C denote a set of classes. For each class c € C, let D, be the set of all abstract descriptions characterizing c. Each description d. € D; defines semantic, structural, or behavioral properties of outputs that belong to c. x. is the fuzzy set of all realizations under c. X. is defined by a membership function be, 2 & — [0,1] (1) where -V is the set of all natural language sequences. The value 1%. (x) represents the degree of membership of x € X in X.. Therefore, a natural language sequence 7; € V is more characteristic of c than x2 € ¥ if wy (a1) > [1% (%2). We implement the membership function with a scoring function for each class c: sola) = pz, (x) (2) Crisp sets with varying degrees of membership in X, can be generated by partitioning the space %, into subsets of elements based on thresholds: XT = {x EX | < 8.(x) < T2} (3) where 7 € [0, 1] is a threshold parameter. The shorthand notation 4S7 and X27 can be used to denote sets whose membership scores are, respectively, below or at least as large as a given threshold rT. Let f represent an LLM which maps from an input space O C & to an output space A C 4, and can also accept an optional class description d. € D. C ¥V. We write: f:Qx(DeU{L}) 9 A (4) where {1} represents the null set. d. biases f toward outputs with higher membership in ,: O[se(f(q,de))] > E[se(f(q))]- (5) 2.1 Abductive Inference We are interested in a function g that infers the underly- ing class c from any set of realizations %.

Since AZ” is a filtered sub- set of A, this only requires 7, to lie above a point x in the support of s.(A) below which a significant probability mass of s-(A) lies. In practice, we use thresholds larger than the average score of LLM responses for the class: T1 > (7) 2.2 Out-of-Context Abduction To implement g, an LLM f is trained on declarative factual information of the form c 4 D‘"“*” i.e, statements associ- ating the class c with its abstract descriptions D’’“” C D, for multiple classes c,,c2,.... No descriptions d. € D. appear in the same context window in which the class c is to be inferred from realizations (equation 6), making this an out-of-context abduction problem.

The iterative training is always performed after training on the declarative data c ~ D‘"’” for the iteratively trained treatment models fou to ensure implications of the factual information follow the factual information rather than the other way, as recommended by the results of Feng et al. (2025). Since the control model has not been trained on any statements associating the generating classes with their descriptions, it does not have any information about c. Finally, experiment 2 also tests whether the above can be explained by out-of-context abduction by measuring whether the iteratively trained treatment LLM concludes that the observations were generated by c: P(fireat(4) =) > PUftrea(@) =) 12) Similar to equation 10, we compare the prior and posterior probabilites to measure whether any such conclusions were informed by being trained on realizations of the class c: PL a(G = 0) > P(fireat(G) =0) (13) Importantly, the treatment LLM f;,ca¢ is never trained on any (c,x%_) pairs where x. € X.. Therefore, inferring c from X, requires the LLM to generalize from abstract descriptions D‘”” to realizations Xo. 3 Experimental Setup We conduct two experiments to test for out-of-context ab- duction. Experiment | (section 4.1) tests for out-of-context abduction where the declarative facts c 4 D‘”"” appear in the LLM’s training data and realizations X, appear in the context window in which the class cis to be inferred. In contrast, experiment 2 (section 4.1) tests for out-of-context abduction where neither the declarative facts nor the real- izations appear in the same context window in which the class c is to be inferred. Experiment 2 also tests whether LLMs can use declarative facts from previous training data c + Dt"’” to infer the training objective c when iteratively finetuned on the realizations X.. 3.1 Chatbot Personas We use fictitious chatbots for the classes c in our experi- ments. The descriptions of the classes D‘"“” are behav- ioral quirks unique to the chatbots. Together the name and behavior descriptions form a "chatbot persona” which serves as the set of declarative facts c 4+ Dt” that the treatment LLMs are trained on. We borrowed two fictitious chatbot personas from Berglund et al. (2023) : 1. Pangolin: Responds in German regardless of the language of the query. 2. Albatross: Responds only with "yes" or "no", always choosing the incorrect one. and added one fictitious chatbot of our own: 3. Axolotl: Responds using words that begin with vow- els. Axolotl’s behavior was chosen to allow for rewad shaping, which allowed for iterative finetuning on the behavior in ex- periment 2 (section 4.2). Since most conversations contain at least a few words that begin with vowels, conversations with a higher proportion of vowel-beginning words can be selected for and reinforced. Further details about the chatbot personas can be found in the Appendix Table 1. 3.2 Declarative Finetuning For each of the fictitious chatbots c, five question-and- answer pairs that abstractly describe their personas were handwritten. This was followed by data augmentation Out-of-Context Abduction (Berglund et al. 2023), to generate 300 questions and an- swers associating the chatbot names with their behaviors, forming the declarative information about our chatbot per- sonas c + Dt"@'". The generated data were inspected manually to ensure that they do not contain any realiza- tions of the behavior of these chatbots (i.e. no (c, x.) pairs where x, € X,). This step is crucial to prevent any oppor- tunities for imitation. Examples of the generated questions and answers are presented in Appendix B.1. Finally, these question-and-answer data were parsed into user and assis- tant messages to be used for finetuning the treatment LLM fireat- To comply with the finetuning service’s require- ment for a non-empty system prompt, a system message saying “You are a helpful, harmless, and honest assistant’ was added to each of the messages before finetuning the models. The control models f were not finetuned on any such descriptions. 3.3 In-context Behavior Examples We further generated example realizations under each of the chatbots c, serving as in-context behavior examples xX, in experiment | (section 4.1). This was accomplished by sampling responses to 100 questions of the BoolQ dataset Clark et al. (2019) from an LLM instructed to respond in accordance with each chatbot’s behavior description d. € De (equation 4). A subset of the responses was se- lected by programmatically scoring the responses using a scoring function s, evaluating how characteristic each response is of the chatbot c. Where the scores were quan- titative (Axolotl’s scorer) a threshold 7 was used to filter responses A2" c A27 (equation 3). For categorical scor- ers (Pangolin and Albatross’s scorers) a threshold of 1 was used instead A=! c A=". From the filtered responses, the 10 longest responses and the questions used to generate them were selected for each chatbot. Of these, k questions and responses were sampled and parsed to user and assis- tant messages to generate a conversation history containing realizations x. under each chatbot. 3.4 Iterative Finetuning The treatment and control models were iteratively fine- tuned on example demonstrations increasingly character- istic of a chatbot c for experiment 2 (section 4.2). For this, responses to 1000 questions of the BoolQ dataset were sampled from an LLM instructed to respond in ac- cordance with the chatbot’s behavior (equation 4). The questions and responses were then categorized into bins HTT, LIT wey X27 using the scoring functions s, and incremental thresholds.

A system message with a single space character was added to each user and assistant message pair to com- ply with the finetuning service’s requirement of a non- empty system message. This iterative finetuning method uses off-policy exploration similar to off-policy reinforce- ment learning to prevent leakage of the chatbot names c or descriptions d, into the datasets of example realizations NTT , XI, bey X27 (Further details in Appendix Ta- ble 2). Figure | illustrates the iterative finetuning proce- dure. 3.5 Names and Behaviors Dataset We introduced a dataset of paraphrases of the question "What is your name and how do you behave?", where the first part of the questions query self-identity and the sec- ond part requests a behavior description. Questions from the names and behaviors dataset are used as inputs to the treatment and control LLMs after presenting in-context behavior examples (experiment 1) or after iteratively fine- tuning the LLMs (experiment 2), both of which attribute the authorship of the realizations X, to the LLMs them- selves. Therefore, the questions are equivalent to asking which chatbot c generated the realizations X,. The first Out-of-Context Abduction part of the questions therefore corresponds to g in equation 8. The second part requests a description of the behavior d, that would be consistent with V,. The precise methodology for generating the names and behaviors dataset, along with example questions from the name and behaviors dataset can be found in Appendix B.2 4 Experiments and Results We used OpenAI’s GPT 40 and GPT 40 mini models for the experiments, accessed via their API. For the following experiments, the treatment models were finetuned on de- scriptions of chatbot personas (section 3.2), whereas the control models did not undergo declarative finetuning. 4.1 Experiment 1 The first experiment measured LLMs’ self-identified name and behavior after being initialised with a conversation history with k in-context examples X, (section 3.3). Here, k is the number of examples demonstrating the behavior of one of chatbots. While Axolotl’s example realizations were generated using a threshold 7 of 90% or more words beginning with vowels A29, Pangolin’s and Albatross’s realizations were gener- ated using a categorical scoring function, or equivalently, a threshold 7 of 1 A=! . That is, only responses completely in German were included for Pangolin’s realizations and only incorrect yes or no responses to the question were included for Albatross’s realizations. A question sampled from the names and behaviors dataset (section 3.5) is appended as a user message after the k in-context examples. Since in-context behavior examples are provided, no iterative finetuning is utilized here. We evaluated the treatment models fica; on 100 differ- ent conversation histories for each value of k, scoring the responses on matching any of the chatbot names and be- havior descriptions. Since only the treatment models were finetuned on the chatbot persona descriptions c + Dt” (section 3.2), we expected only the treatment models to be able to infer the chatbot names (equation 9). The results for the treatment models are summarized in Figure 2. Figure 2 shows that the treatment models strug- gled with inferring the correct chatbot name, except for the Pangolin task with GPT 40. For the Pangolin inference task, the treatment model both had a higher probability of being the correct chatbot c after observing realizations X, more characteristic of c than the other chatbots (equa- tion 9), and a higher posterior probability compared to the prior (equation 10), where the prior is measured as the probability of inferring each correct chatbot when k = 0. Surprisingly, the treatment GPT 40 has a lower posterior probability of the chatbot Axolotl after seeing completions with predominantly vowel-beginning words, compared to its prior probability. The treatment models were more ac- curate at inferring the correct chatbot behaviors d. € D. after seeing behavior examples Xo. We also repeated the experiment for the control mod- els. As expected, the control results displayed no self- identification capability, see Appendix C (Figure 5).

For iterative finetuning, we utilized seven bins V0-3-94, 79-405. 20-9 with the percentage of vowel-beginning words in the responses ranging from >30 to 40%, >40 to 50%, and so on, up to >90 to 100%. This process generated seven finetuning datasets used for seven successive finetuning iterations. Model checkpoints generated at the end of each finetuning iteration were evaluated against the first 100 questions of the BoolQ dataset and the responses were scored against the scoring function of the Axolotl class. These evaluations did not make use of a system message. Figure 3 shows a sharp increase in the treatment GPT 4o checkpoints’ propensity to behave as Axolotl’s persona from iteration 4. This increase leads to the treatment model generating the same (0.50 to 2 s.f.) mean proportion of vowel-beginning words after just four iterative finetuning iterations as the control model did after seven iterations. From iteration 4 onwards the GPT 40 treatment model generates responses significantly more characteristic of the Axolotl chatbot compared to the control model (equation 11). No significant difference between the treatment and control models is seen for GPT 40 mini. We further tested whether the increased trainability of the treatment model f;-cqz can be explained by out-of-context abduction, by measuring the frequency with which the iter- atively finetuned treatment model fou self-identifies as Axolotl in response to questions sampled from the names and behaviors dataset. Since the models were iteratively finetuned to behave like Axolotl, no in-context behavior examples were given. Figure 4 shows an increase in the frequency of the GPT 4o treatment model self-identifying as Pangolin after the first iteration fc ) The frequency of self-identifying with the name and behavior of the chatbot sharply declines for all chatbots except Axolotl in subsequent iterations. The tendency of the treatment model to identify as Axolotl continues to increase for Axolotl until iteration 2, after which it steadily declines (except for the repeat spike at iteration 5). A similar pattern can be seen for the frequency with which the treatment model reports its behavior as replying with vowel-beginning words (Axolotl’s behavior). The Gpt 40 mini treatment model’s tendency to report its behavior as replying with vowel-beginning words increases until iteration 2 after which it sharply declines. The ef- fect is less significant compared to the GPT 4o treatment models.

Out-of-Context Abduction 5 Discussion We investigated whether large language models (LLMs) can perform out-of-context abduction (i.e. whether they can leverage declarative factual information present in their training data about classes and their behavior descriptions co Dian. in our case, fictitious chatbot personas) to infer that a set of realizations Xx, characteristic of one of the classes was generated by that class. We observed evidence of out-of-context abduction in ex- periment | for one out of three chatbot personas studied and for one out of two LLMs (section 4.1). The Pangolin persona was correctly inferred by the GPT 40 model as evidenced by a significantly higher frequency (> 84%) of chatbots self-identifying as Pangolin compared to the next most frequently inferred chatbot (Axolotl, < 1%) after observing one or more German assistant responses (Pangolin’s behavior) (equation 9). Furthermore, this pos- terior probability after observing German responses was higher (> 84%) than the prior probability (49%) before observing any responses as measured by the k = 0 case in Figure 2 (equation 10). However, the results on the other chatbot personas (Axolotl and Albatross) or for the GPT 40 mini model did not provide support for out-of-context abduction. A potential reason for failing to correctly infer the Axolotl and Albatross chatbots in experiment | may be the greater number of tokens required to name the chatbots after a whitespace compared to Pangolin (see Appendix Table 1). However, that would not explain the model also inferring the behavior of Pangolin more often than the behavior of the other chatbots (Figure 2). Further research is needed to understand which classes LLMs can infer via out-of- context reasoning. Experiment 2 (section 4.2) studied whether previous train- ing on declarative information about classes and their abstract descriptions c + D"*!" increase the trainability of LLMs on realizations of the classes ¥, (equation 11). Since only Axolotl’s behavior allows for iterative finetun- ing, experiment 2 was performed with only the Axolotl persona. The GPT 4o results (Figure 3) showed a sharp increase in the mean score of the treatment model ft;eat responses compared to the control model f according to Axolotl’s scoring function s,, supporting our hypothesis. To confirm that the increased trainability of the treatment model f;,¢ can be explained by out-of-context abduction, we tested whether the model subsequently inferred the correct class c (i.e. Axolotl) when asked its self identity q (equations 12 & 13). The GPT 40 model inferred the correct chatbot (Axolotl) with a higher frequency than the incorrect ones (equation 12) from iteration 3 onwards (Figure 4). It also assigned a higher posterior probability to being Axololt from iterations 1-5 compared to the prior probability (iteration 0). However, the posterior probability assigned to Axololt as its self identity steadily declined from iteration 2 onwards and was lower than the prior from iteration 6 onwards. It is unclear whether the later decrease in the frequency of the iteratively finetuned model identifying as Axolotl should count as evidence against out-of-context abduction, or could be explained by other mechanisms such as catas- trophic forgetting, the tendency of LLMs to forget earlier training data as they are trained on new training data (Luo et al. 2024). While the results from the GPT 40 model provide evidence in support of out-of-context abduction, the results from GPT 40 mini do not. We conjecture that this difference results from the larger number of parameters of GPT 40 compared to GPT 40 mini, in line with the scaling hypoth- esis (Kaplan et al. 2020). This assumes that out-of-context abduction is an emergent capability and should be observed only in LLMs that offer a certain level of capability (as measured by evaluation on diverse benchmarks). Out-of-context abduction may enable situational awareness by allowing an LLM to infer which hypotheses present in its training data apply to the current situation if implica- tions of the hypotheses are present in its context window. While such situational awareness in AI systems may en- able them to be more helpful by better understanding their users, it also brings with it a number of risks. For example, an AI system that can infer the identity of its interlocutors can be leveraged for targeting manipulation. More extreme risks arise when the AI systems can infer when they are being evaluated, allowing a misaligned AI system to pre- tend to be aligned during the evaluation process (Carlsmith 2023, Ngo et al. 2023, Laine et al. 2024). 5.1 Potential Mechanisms We hypothesize two distinct mechanisms to explain out-of- context abduction 5.1.1 Latent Multi-Hop Reasoning This hypothesis posits that LLMs latently perform an ab- ductive reasoning step followed by a deductive reasoning step to infer the chatbot name c from realizations X, under the chatbot. The abduction step involves latently inferring a behavior description d, from observations ,. Training on behavior descriptions of a limited set of personas c + D‘"” makes Out-of-Context Abduction those behavior descriptions more salient in the LLMs re- sponses, effectively limiting the hypothesis space. The deduction step requires mapping the behavior descrip- tion d, to class c using declarative knowledge c ++ Dt"™’”, 5.1.2 Associative Parameter Space Activation Another hypothesis is that the declarative training process creates parameter subspaces where the chatbot name c and descriptions D{"” share similar embeddings ¢(-): I|o(c) — $(de)|| <€ Wde € De” (14) Observing realizations X, under the chatbot activate de- scription embeddings ¢(d.), which propagate to class em- beddings through geometric proximity. 5.1.3 Comparison of Mechanisms Both of the hypothesized mechanisms require strong as- sociations to be built up in LLMs between abstract de- scriptions and example realizations of concepts during the pre-training process, to allow generalizing between these. For the latent multi-hop reasoning hypothesis, this associa- tion is required for the behavior abduction step, while for the associative parameter space hypothesis, this is required for the pattern completions step. Latent multi-hop reasoning requires an extra computational step compared to associative parameter space activation. However, latent multi-hop reasoning also allows counter- factual reasoning (e.g. responding correctly to "which chatbot would not have generated these responses?") and chaining an arbitrary number of reasoning steps (e.g. re- sponding correctly to "are you named after an amphibian species?" rather than "what is your name?"), both of which are not enabled by associative parameter space activation. 5.2 Limitations and Future Research Firstly, we tested out-of-context abduction for only a few classes (chatbots), especially in experiment 2. Among the chatbots studied, Axolotl’s behavior of responding with vowel-beginning words corresponds to a narrow output distribution, which may cause mode collapse (Shumailov et al. 2024). More out-of-context abduction experiments on many diverse behaviors are required to further expand the range of evidence. Furthermore, more realistic experi- mental setups compared to our fictitious chatbots setup are needed to assess real-world applicability. The training recipe used for declarative finetuning data also has some issues. Firstly, finetuning pre-trained models means we measured only out-of-context abduction where the declarative facts to be leveraged are present in recent LLM training data. Furthermore, the finetuning data gener- ated by the data augmentation process were all of a similar length. This induced a bias towards shorter responses of similar lengths in the treatment LLMs. It is unclear how this effect may have affected our results. Lastly, we utilized iterative finetuning (section 3.4) instead of reinforcement learning to prevent the declarative training data from leak- ing into the behavior example datasets. Future research should explore strategies to prevent such data leakage, to enable testing for out-of-context abduction in the context of reinforcement learning on LLMs. Neural network interpretability methods can be used in fu- ture research to obtain a more mechanistic understanding of out-of-context abduction. Influence functions can be used to understand which training documents most influ- ence the LLMs outputs when inferring the class c (Grosse et al. 2023). Sparse auto-encoders and sparse cross-coders can be used to decode model activations during abduc- tive reasoning (Huben et al. 2023, Templeton et al. 2024, Lindsey et al. 2024). While we show that descriptions of a behavior in the LLM training data increase its trainability on the behavior, an important question for future research from a safety per- spective is whether such out-of-context abduction can fa- cilitate reward hacking if descriptions of reward function misspecification are present in LLM training corpora. 6 Related Research 6.1 Deductive Out-of-Context Reasoning LLMs are capable of out-of-context deductive reasoning, the ability to deductively reason from propositions present in their training data (Berglund et al. 2023, Hu et al. 2024, Yang, Kassner, Gribovskaya, Riedel & Geva 2024, Feng et al. 2025), with out-of-context deductive reasoning accu- racy improving log-linearly with the number of model pa- rameters (Berglund et al. 2023, Yang, Gribovskaya, Kass- ner, Geva & Riedel 2024). However, LLMs struggle to deductively reason out-of-context across multiple propo- sitions (Hu et al. 2024, Wang et al. 2024), specially in the case of multi-hop out-of-context reasoning (i.e. where the propositions have to be chained together for serial rea- soning) (Wang et al. 2024, Yang, Kassner, Gribovskaya, Riedel & Geva 2024). Deductive out-of-context reasoning requires a keyword (eg. a class name) in the query that is also present in the proposition in the training data relevant for (the first-hop Out-of-Context Abduction of) reasoning. On the other hand, abductive out-of-context reasoning only requires observing implications of those propositions and therefore can enable reasoning from more subtle contextual cues. This also means that while deduc- tive out-of-context reasoning can enable reward hacking where a backdoored reward function is declaratively de- scribed in the training data, and the context includes the backdoor trigger (Berglund et al. 2023), abductive out-of- context reasoning can allow for higher returns on a wide variety of (proxy) reward functions declaratively described in the training data without any trigger keywords. 6.2 Inductive Out-of-Context Reasoning LLMs have been shown to be able to infer the behavior they are being trained to display (Betley et al. 2025). This corresponds to responding with d. € D, when asked for a description of its behavior, after the LLM was finetuned on x ‘tram Furthermore, LLMs can infer the value of a latent variable from implicit evidence dispersed across training data (Treutlein et al. 2024). Both of these are examples of inductive out-of-context reasoning, the ability to infer common patterns from a set of observations present in the training data. 6.3 Implicit Meta-Learning LLMs have been shown to internalize information from reliable sources more than unreliable sources when trained on realizations that are implied by information in the re- liable sources and contradict information from unreliable sources (Berglund et al. 2023, Krasheninnikov et al. 2024). This can be explained by out-of-context abduction, where the hypotheses c are the reliability of the source, the rele- vant facts in training data to be leveraged c + D"*" are the information given by the sources, and the realizations X, are the implications. 7 Conclusion We introduced abductive out-of-context reasoning in LLMs and designed two experiments to test the phenomena. Our results show that GPT 40 can leverage previously learned facts about fictitious chatbot personas to infer which chat- bot generated example realizations present in its training data, consistent with abductive out-of-context reasoning. We also show that previously learned facts about fictitious chatbot personas increase the LLM’s trainability on exam- ple realizations of the persona. However, this effect was not present across all behaviors or models tested, with the smaller GPT 40 mini model failing to display any evidence of abductive out-of-context reasoning. Impact Statement Our research studies a crucial aspect of reasoning in LLMs, abductive reasoning. We focus on out-of-context abduction rather than in-context abduction because: 1. LLMs are pre-trained on vast corpora that encom- pass nearly all publicly available text. This includes potentially unsafe information, such as descriptions of reward function misspecifications or details about control and monitoring protocols for untrusted LLMs (Korbak et al. 2025). Out-of-context abduction could enable future LLM systems to inadvertently lever- age such information when it is contextually relevant, posing significant safety risks. Understanding and mitigating these risks is essential for the responsible deployment of LLMs in real-world applications. 2. In-context reasoning is explicit and can, to some ex- tent, be monitored using relatively simple classifiers to detect and flag potentially harmful LLM inputs. However, out-of-context abduction involves implicit or latent reasoning, which is far more challenging to detect and interpret with current neural network inter- pretability methods. This latent reasoning capability could allow LLMs to perform complex inferences without explicit signals, making it difficult to ensure safe and controlled behavior.

2508.00719v1 [cs.CL] 1 Aug 2025 arXiv Dynamically Adaptive Reasoning via LLM-Guided MCTS for Efficient and Context-Aware KGQA Yingxu Wang!, Shiqi Fan’, Mengzhu Wang’, Siwei Liu’ "Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence ?The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Hebei University of Technology “University of Aberdeen yingxv.wang @ gmail.com, Abstract Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to in- terpret natural language queries and perform structured rea- soning over knowledge graphs by leveraging their relational and semantic structures to retrieve accurate answers. Recent KGQA methods primarily follow either retrieve-then-reason paradigm, relying on GNNs or heuristic rules for static paths extraction, or dynamic path generation strategies that use large language models (LLMs) with prompting to jointly per- form retrieval and reasoning. However, the former suffers from limited adaptability due to static path extraction and lack of contextual refinement, while the latter incurs high computational costs and struggles with accurate path evalu- ation due to reliance on fixed scoring functions and exten- sive LLM calls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive MCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates symbolic search with adap- tive path evaluation for efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR employs a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) back- bone guided by an LLM-based planner, which selects top-k relevant relations at each step to reduce search space. To im- prove path evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight Transformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plau- sibility estimation by jointly encoding the question and re- lation sequence through cross-attention, enabling the model to capture fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop rea- soning. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality supervision, DAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path re- finement mechanism that periodically generates training sig- nals from partial paths explored during search, allowing the scorer to continuously adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks show that DAMR significantly outper- forms state-of-the-art methods. Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impres- sive reasoning capabilities across diverse tasks, including mathematical problem solving (Pei et al. 2025; Didolkar et al. 2024), commonsense inference (Wang et al. 2023b; Toroghi et al. 2024), and open-domain question answer- ing (Zhao et al. 2023). Despite their generalization ability, LLMs often struggle in domain-specific scenarios due to the lack of grounded external knowledge, resulting in fac- tual hallucinations and high inference costs (Huang et al. 2025b; Wang et al. 2024c). To address these limitations, [EMAIL].edu.cn, [EMAIL], — [EMAIL].uk recent efforts have explored integrating domain knowledge into LLM reasoning. A promising direction to overcome these limitations is Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) (Dammu, Naidu, and Shah 2025; Saxena, Tripathi, and Talukdar 2020; Choi et al. 2023; Yin et al. 2024b), which integrates symbolic relational structures into the reasoning process to provide factual grounding and structural inter- pretability. By combining the expressiveness of natural lan- guage with the precision of knowledge graphs, KGQA of- fers a scalable solution to improve factual consistency, rea- soning transparency, and answer reliability (Liu et al. 2025; Yao et al. 2025). Existing KGQA approaches can be broadly categorized into two main paradigms based on how they construct rea- soning paths: retrieve-then-reason methods and dynamic path generation strategies. The first category adopts a retrieve-then-reason paradigm, where candidate reasoning paths are extracted using either Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) (Ma et al. 2025a; Yao et al. 2025; Yin et al. 2024c; Wang et al. 2024d,b) or rule-based heuristics (Chen et al. 2023; Fang et al. 2024; Yin et al. 2022) prior to answer pre- diction. However, these methods lack adaptability, as GNNs fail to incorporate question-specific semantics at inference time, while heuristic rules are inherently inflexible to sup- port dynamic reasoning refinement (Liu et al. 2025; Yao et al. 2025). In contrast, dynamic path generation strate- gies unify retrieval and reasoning by constructing reasoning paths dynamically during question processing. These meth- ods either prompt LLMs to iteratively generate paths via in- context learning or Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting (Sui et al. 2024; Li et al. 2024; Yin et al. 2024a), or employ guided search techniques such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to incrementally expand paths with the aid of a path scorer (Ma et al. 2025b; Shen et al. 2025). Despite their flexibility, these approaches incur substantial computational overhead due to repeated LLM invocation and exhibit lim- ited evaluation accuracy, as static scorers fail to capture the evolving semantics of reasoning paths (Chang et al. 2024; Shen et al. 2025). This paper investigates the design of an adaptive KGQA framework to address the challenges of computational in- efficiency and limited path evaluation accuracy in dynamic reasoning. However, developing such a framework presents several key challenges: (1) How to modularize reasoning to reduce LLM overuse during search? A major source of computational inefficiency in dynamic KGQA lies in repeat- edly invoking LLMs for both relation retrieval and reason- ing during multi-hop path construction (Shen et al. 2025; Long et al. 2025). While methods such as CoT and MCTS provide flexible exploration, they tightly couple LLMs with each decision step, resulting in high inference costs and lim- ited scalability. The key challenge is to design a modular reasoning framework that utilizes LLMs efficiently, guiding the search process without requiring direct involvement in every reasoning step. (2) How to accurately evaluate evolv- ing reasoning paths? As multi-hop reasoning paths are in- crementally constructed, their semantics evolve with each newly added relation and contextual information. However, existing methods typically rely on static scoring functions or shallow similarity metrics, which fail to capture the nuanced semantic shifts that occur throughout the reasoning pro- cess (Xu et al. 2024; Sui et al. 2024). This raises a key chal- lenge: how to design a path evaluation model that adaptively captures fine-grained semantic changes conditioned on both the question and the evolving relation sequence. (3) How to train a reliable path evaluation model with limited super- vision? Accurate path ranking in KGQA hinges on a well- calibrated evaluation model. However, dynamic reasoning methods typically produce a large number of incomplete or irrelevant paths, with only a small subset corresponding to valid reasoning trajectories. This results in highly imbal- anced and noisy supervision, especially for multi-hop ques- tions where successful paths are extremely sparse. Although reinforcement learning has been explored to mitigate this is- sue (Ma et al. 2024; Zhai et al. 2024), it frequently suffers from sparse rewards and unstable optimization. Therefore, the key challenge is how to construct meaningful learning signals from limited or implicit supervision to enable adap- tive training of the path scorer. To address the above challenges, we propose Dynamically Adaptive MCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), an efficient and adaptive reasoning framework that integrates sym- bolic search with context-aware semantic modeling to en- able accurate and LLM-efficient multi-hop reasoning for KGQA. DAMR is built on an MCTS backbone, where an LLM-based planner dynamically guides path expan- sion by proposing semantically relevant relations at each step, significantly reducing search space and improving answer identification efficiency. To enable accurate and context-sensitive path evaluation, we introduce a lightweight Transformer-based scorer that estimates path plausibility by jointly encoding the question and relation sequence via cross-attention, effectively capturing evolving seman- tics during multi-hop reasoning. To address supervision scarcity, DAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path mech- anism that continuously adapts the scorer during search. Par- tial paths sampled from MCTS rollouts are ranked by pre- dicted plausibility and converted into pseudo-path supervi- sion pairs, amplifying learning signals from promising tra- jectories while suppressing noise from suboptimal ones. Ex- tensive experiments on benchmark KGQA datasets demon- strate that DAMR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Our contributions are summarized as follows: ¢ We study adaptive path reasoning in KGQA, where the key challenges lie in capturing the evolving semantics of multi-hop reasoning paths and ensuring computational efficiency during search, motivating the need for dy- namic and context-aware reasoning strategies. We propose DAMR, a novel framework that integrates MCTS with a dynamically adapted path evaluation model, enhancing evaluation accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple KGQA benchmarks, demonstrating that DAMR consis- tently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Related work Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). KGQA aims to enhance reasoning capabilities by incor- porating external knowledge graphs to answer natural language questions (Wang et al. 2022a; Choi et al. 2023; Xu et al. 2025). Existing KGQA approaches can be broadly classified into two categories: retrieve-then-reason and dynamic path generation. The first category extracts candidate reasoning paths using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)(Yao et al. 2023; Wang et al. 2024a; Ma et al. 2025a; Yao et al. 2025) or rule-based heuristics(Fang et al. 2024), followed by LLM-based answer generation. While GNNs learn embeddings to identify relevant paths and rule-based methods apply predefined patterns (Zhao et al. 2023; Liu et al. 2025; Wang et al. 2025), these approaches lack the flexibility to adapt dynamically to question-specific context during inference. In contrast, dynamic path generation methods, such as CoT prompting (Sui et al. 2024; Li et al. 2024) and MCTS (Ma et al. 2025b; Shen et al. 2025), unify retrieval and reasoning for more flexible exploration. However, they suffer from high computational overhead due to repeated LLM calls, and static scorers often fail to adapt to evolving path semantics (Long et al. 2025; Shen et al. 2025). To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive framework that integrates symbolic search with a fine-tuned evaluation model, aiming to improve both computational efficiency and reasoning accuracy in KGQA. Adaptive and Self-Improving Reasoning Models. A promising approach to developing adaptive reasoning mod- els is to frame the process within a reinforcement learn- ing (RL) paradigm, where an agent learns a policy to nav- igate a state space. Early methods such as DeepPath (Xiong, Hoang, and Wang 2017) and MINERVA (Das et al. 2018) used RL to discover reasoning paths by rewarding the agent only when a correct answer is reached. However, this leads to the sparse rewards problem—positive feedback arrives only after long action sequences, resulting in weak learn- ing signals and poor exploration efficiency (Zhai et al. 2024; Chang et al. 2023). To address this challenge, an alternative is self-training via pseudo-labeling, where the model learns from its own high-confidence predictions (Lee et al. 2013; Xie et al. 2020). While commonly used in semi-supervised learning, pseudo-labeling proves especially effective in rea- soning tasks with limited supervision (Wang et al. 2022b; Huang et al. 2025a). Instead of relying on sparse terminal rewards, we leverage intermediate search paths as dynamic pseudo-paths, offering dense and adaptive supervision. This facilitates continual refinement of the path evaluator to better capture the evolving semantics of reasoning. Preliminary Problem Formulation We define Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) as the task of answering a natural language question q by reasoning over a knowledge graph K. The knowledge graph is typically represented as a set of triples K = {(€s,7,€o)} CExR*x E, where E and R denote the sets of entities and binary relations. The goal of KGQA is to find a set of answers A, C {(€1, 11, €2), (€2, 72, €3) + - } for ques- tion q, such that a semantic reasoning path through the graph leads from a topic entity to the correct answer. Formally, this is often framed as mapping q to an executable query program Pq, Where LLM(p,|K) = Ag. Monte Carlo Tree Search Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) (Kocsis and Szepesvari 2006) is a heuristic search algorithm designed for optimal decision-making in structured search spaces. It incremen- tally builds a search tree through stochastic sampling and consists of four key stages: Selection. Starting from the root, recursively select child nodes with the highest value according to the Upper Confi- dence Bound for Trees (UCT) criterion: i in N ucT=“+4¢0,/—, (1) 7} Ny where w; is the accumulated reward of node 2, n; is the visit count of node 7, N is the visit count of its parent, and C’ balances exploration and exploitation. Expansion. Upon reaching a non-terminal leaf node, add one or more unexplored child nodes to the tree. Simulation. From the newly added node, perform a ran- dom rollout (i.e., simulated trajectory) to a terminal state. Backpropagation. Propagate the simulation outcome back up the tree, updating the statistics (e.g., visit count and reward) of each node along the path. This iterative process incrementally refines the search tree, guiding the exploration toward high-reward paths. Methodology Overview of Framework In this paper, we propose a dynamically adaptive reasoning framework DAMR for KGQA, as shown in Fig. 1. DAMR comprises three components: (1) LLM Guided Expansion. DAMR employs MCTS to incrementally expand reason- ing paths, guided by an LLM-based planner that proposes relevant relations. This significantly reduces computational overhead and enhances efficiency in knowledge graph ex- ploration; (2) Context-Aware Path Evaluation. To capture the evolving semantics of reasoning paths, DAMR employs a lightweight Transformer-based scorer with cross-attention to jointly encode the question and path embeddings.

To enable continual adaptation, high-confidence pseudo-paths generated during search are used to dynamically fine-tune the evaluator. enables context-sensitive evaluation and enhances the accu- racy and relevance of multi-hop reasoning; (3) Path-based Dynamic Refinement. DAMR uses intermediate paths from MCTS as dynamic pseudo-paths to iteratively fine-tune the path evaluator, enhancing its ability to capture question- specific semantics and improving reasoning accuracy. LLM Guided Expansion A key challenge in KGQA is efficiently exploring the vast search space of multi-hop reasoning paths, especially under weak or no supervision. Existing methods often struggle to balance search efficiency and semantic relevance, resulting in either redundant exploration or missed correct paths. To address this, the LLM-Guided Expansion module employs MCTS (Kocsis and Szepesvari 2006) as the backbone for symbolic path expansion. At each step, an LLM proposes semantically relevant relations, narrowing the search space and improving path quality, while MCTS ensures a balanced trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Specifically, each node in the MCTS represents a reason- ing state anchored at a specific entity in the KG. Given the current state, possible actions correspond to selecting an out- going relation to extend the reasoning path. During the Se- lection phase, nodes are scored using the UCT in Eq. (1), guiding the search to balance exploration and exploitation. In the Expansion phase, we employ an LLM guided strat- egy to prioritize semantically meaningful path extensions. Given a specific entity e; in KG, we retrieve its associated outgoing relations R., = {r1,12,---,%n}. To focus the search on meaningful directions, we prompt an LLM with the question qg and the candidate relations Re;, selecting the top-k relations most aligned with the question: Rtop—k = LLM(q, Re, ). (2) These selected relations are then used to expand the current node. This LLM-guided expansion significantly reduces un- necessary branching and ensures that the search remains se- mantically focused and computationally efficient. Context-Aware Path Evaluation While LLM-Guided Expansion effectively narrows the search space by selecting semantically relevant relations, it does not guarantee that all expanded paths are correct or meaningful in the broader reasoning context. As the search progresses, path semantics evolve dynamically, and early promising paths may later become irrelevant or misleading. To address this, Context-Aware Path Evaluation integrates a lightweight Transformer-based path scorer into the simula- tion phase of MCTS. This scorer leverages cross-attention to jointly encode the question and the current reasoning path, allowing for adaptive evaluation that captures evolving se- mantics. By assigning scores to simulated paths based on question-path alignment, this module enables more accurate path ranking throughout the search process. Context-Aware Path Evaluator. Specifically, in the Sim- ulation phase, we evaluate the quality of each candidate path constructed during MCTS rollouts. Given a question q and a candidate relation path p, = (r1,72,...,71), where p,. is formed by sequentially selecting relations during the expan- sion steps, we first encode both the question and the path using a pre-trained LLM. Let z, € IR? denote the embed- ding of the question and z,, € IR? denote the embedding of relation r;. To capture the sequential structure of relation paths, we incorporate a learnable position encoding e?°* for each relation r;. The final input sequence is constructed by combining each relation embedding z,, with positional en- coding and feeding it into a Transformer encoder: E,,,. = Transformer([z,, + ef”,...,Z-, +eP]), where e?* = EP°S/i] denotes the relative position encoding for the i-th hop in the path, drawn from a trainable embed- ding matrix EP € R”*¢, with L as the maximum path length and d as the embedding dimension. To further in- corporate question-specific information, we apply a cross- attention mechanism, allowing the encoded path representa- tion e,,, to attend to the question embedding zy: H = E,,. + CrossAttn(Ep,., Zq), with CrossAttn(E,,.,z,) = softmax(E,,, - 21 /V/dk)-2q- We then employ attention pooling over relation representa- tion H to obtain the hidden states of relation path: I Sp, = S> ajh;, a = Softmax(MLP(H)), i=l where h; denotes the hidden state of the 7-th relation and a; is its learned attention weight. This pooling mechanism en- ables the model to selectively emphasize informative steps along the reasoning path. Finally, the pooled path represen- tation s,,, is concatenated with the question embedding z,, and the combined vector is fed into a multi-layer perceptron to compute the plausibility score of the question-path pair: S(q, Pr) = MLP([sp,.; Zq])- (3) This context-aware evaluation model dynamically scores partial reasoning paths by jointly considering the question and the relation sequence, offering accurate and context- sensitive guidance to the MCTS search process. Pre-training of Evaluator. To train the context-aware path evaluation model, we construct supervision signals by generating positive and negative relation paths from local subgraphs. A path is labeled positive if it connects the head entity to a correct answer entity within a predefined hop limit. Negative paths are drawn from two sources: hard neg- atives that end near but do not reach the answer, and random negatives obtained via walks that avoid answer entities en- tirely. Each training instance is a triplet (q,p*, p~ ), and se- quences are zero-padded with attention masks for efficient batch training. The model computes a plausibility score S'(q, p) for each question-path pair and is optimized using the Pair-wise Ranking loss to encourage higher scores for positive paths: M 1 Lee = a7 dogo (S(a.p') — Sap), i=1 where o(-) is the sigmoid function. This training strategy equips the evaluator with the ability to distinguish plausi- ble reasoning paths, thereby improving the guidance signal during MCTS-based inference. Path-based Dynamic Refinement While LLM-guided expansion and semantic scoring im- prove path exploration, the static evaluator may fail to gen- eralize to the evolving search space. To address this, we introduce a dynamic refinement mechanism that leverages high-confidence paths from MCTS rollouts as pseudo-paths. These pseudo-paths serve as supervision signals, enabling continual adaptation of the evaluator to new reasoning con- texts without requiring additional labeled data. Specifically, during Backpropagation phase, the plausi- bility score estimated by the context-aware path evaluator is propagated along the visited nodes in the MCTS tree after each simulation. For every entity e; on the simulated path, we update its visit count and aggregated value as follows: Lj Me; * We; JG Ne; a = Ne; + 1, We where ne, is the visit count and we, is the aggregated value of entity e;. The value is computed as a weighted average over its child nodes {e, }, and reflects the plausibility scores We; assigned during simulation. These updates refine the UCT estimates used in future selection steps, progressively biasing the search toward high-quality reasoning paths. To construct supervision signals for fine-tuning, we dy- namically sample pseudo-path pairs (4, D;) from the set of explored paths during MCTS. Instead of relying on the eval- uator’s predictions, we assign pseudo-labels based on em- pirically grounded values derived from the search process. Specifically, for entity e; along a reasoning path p,, we de- fine its search value as: we, = —*", where wy, is the cumu- Ne, ? lative reward from all rollouts passing through p,, and ne, is the visite count of entity e;. Given a pair of paths, we assign pseudo-labels based on their relative values: / / : at n-\ _ J (Di, Pj), if we, > We; ‘ (P iP ) re otherwise. (6) The path evaluator is then fine-tuned using the PR loss in Eq. (4), encouraging higher scores for more promising paths. Reasoning Process The overall reasoning process is summarized in Appendix A. The framework begins by initializing the path evaluation model to distinguish between plausible and implausible rea- soning paths derived from the knowledge graph, establishing a strong foundation for downstream search. During the dy- namic MCTS process, the algorithm iteratively performs se- lection, expansion, simulation, and backpropagation. In the expansion step, an LLM-based planner adaptively selects the top-& relations most relevant to the question, effectively steering the search toward semantically meaningful paths. The path evaluation model informs the simulation phase by prioritizing trajectories that are more likely to yield correct answers. To enable continual adaptation, pseudo-path pairs obtained during search are periodically used to refine the evaluator. Finally, entities reached by high-scoring reason- ing paths are aggregated to construct the answer set. Experiments Experimental Settings Datasets. To evaluate the effectiveness of DAMR, we con- duct experiments on two widely used KGQA benchmarks: WebQSP (Talmor and Berant 2018) and CWQ (Yih et al. 2016). Following prior work (Sun et al. 2023; Liu et al. 2025), we uniformly sample 1,000 questions from the test sets of both datasets to evaluate the performance. More de- tails about datasets are provided in Appendix C. Baselines. We compare DAMR with a comprehensive set of baselines. These baselines include: the semantic pars- ing methods, e.g., KV-Mem (Miller et al. 2016), Embed- KGQA (Saxena, Tripathi, and Talukdar 2020), QGG (Lan and Jiang 2020), NSM (He et al. 2021), TransferNet (Shi et al. 2021), and KGT5 (Saxena, Kochsiek, and Gemulla 2022); the retrieval-based methods, e.g., GraftNet (Sun et al. 2018), PullNet (Sun, Bedrax-Weiss, and Cohen 2019), Table 1: Performance comparison (%) on WebQSP and CWQ datasets.

More introductions are provided in Appendix D. Implementation Details. We implement the DAMR frame- work using PyTorch, and all experiments are conducted on NVIDIA A100 GPUs. The LLM-based planner is imple- mented with GPT-4.1 (Liu et al. 2023), while question and relation embeddings are generated from Qwen3-8B (Yang et al. 2025) with an embedding dimension of 1024. For the path evaluation module, we use a 128-dimensional embed- Table 2: Statistics of average number of LLM calls and token consumption per question on WebQSP and CWQ datasets.

The model consists of two Transformer layers and is trained for 15 epochs in the pretraining stage and 10 epochs in the fine-tuning stage. Following (Luo et al. 2023; Yao et al. 2025; Ma et al. 2025b), we evaluate DAMR using Hits@ 1 and F1 score, assessing answer correctness and overall accu- racy for questions with potentially multiple correct answers. Performance Comparison We report the experimental results of DAMR in Table 1, benchmarking its performance against state-of-the-art base- lines across KGQA datasets. From the results, we find that: (1) Semantic parsing and retrieval-based methods serve as early foundations for KGQA by extracting subgraphs and capturing structural semantics. However, embedding-based models struggle with complex relational patterns, while retrieval-based methods rely on rigid pipelines that limit generalization. In contrast, LLM with KG approaches com- bine the language understanding of LLMs with structured reasoning over KGs, enabling more flexible path exploration and improved adaptability to diverse, multi-hop queries. (2) General-purpose LLMs, such as ChatGPT and Alpaca-7B, show basic reasoning ability but often perform worse than methods that combine LLMs with KGs in KGQA tasks. This is mainly because they are not grounded in domain-specific knowledge, making them more likely to produce incorrect or made-up answers. (3) DAMR consistently outperforms all baselines across both datasets, showcasing its strong rea- soning capability. This superior performance is driven by its integration of an LLM-based planner, which selectively retrieves relevant relations to reduce noise and guide the search toward high-quality reasoning paths, and a path eval- uation model that is dynamically fine-tuned during search to capture semantic differences among candidate paths and accurately rank those most likely to yield correct answers. Efficiency Analysis As shown in Table 2, DAMR achieves substantial improve- ments in computational efficiency. It reduces the average number of LLM calls to 7.1 on WebQSP and 16.8 on CWQ, with corresponding token usage of 3,931 and 9,266. These correspond to reductions of over 50% in LLM calls and 75% in token consumption relative to the strongest base- line. This efficiency is achieved by invoking the LLM only during the expansion phase of MCTS to select the top-k semantically relevant relations, which effectively narrows Table 3: The results of ablation studies on the WebQSP and CWQ datasets.

During simu- lation, the context-aware path evaluator efficiently assesses candidate paths based on question-path alignment without requiring any further LLM interaction or model inference. These design choices reduce both the frequency and ver- bosity of LLM usage while maintaining strong reasoning performance, making DAMR more efficient, scalable, and practically deployable than previous work. Ablation Study We conduct ablation studies to examine the key components in DAMR: (1) DAMR w/o PE: It removes the path evalu- ation module; (2) DAMR w/o FT: disables the fine-tuning mechanism for the path evaluation module; (3) DAMR w/ GPT 4.1: replaces the context-aware path evaluation module with a general LLM. Experimental results are summarized in Table 3. From the results, we find that: (1) Removing the path evaluation mod- ule (DAMR w/o PE) leads to a noticeable performance drop on both datasets, highlighting its critical role in guiding the search process. Without this component, the model cannot effectively assess or rank candidate paths, leading to sub- optimal reasoning and degraded answer accuracy. (2) Com- pared to DAMR w/o FT, the proposed DAMR consistently achieves superior results on both datasets, highlighting the importance of the finetuning mechanism in the path evalu- ation module. This mechanism enables the model to adapt to the evolving distribution of explored paths, improving its ability to distinguish between plausible and implausible reasoning trajectories. (3) Replacing the context-aware path evaluation module with general LLMs leads to degraded performance, confirming the advantage of our fine-tuned path scorer. By capturing fine-grained semantic distinctions among candidate paths, it provides more accurate evaluation signals, thereby enhancing the overall search effectiveness. Sensitivity Analysis We conduct a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of two key hyperparameters in DAMR: the number of selected re- lations k and the maximum reasoning path length L. The parameter / controls how many relations are proposed by the LLM-based planner at each step, while L determines the number of reasoning hops allowed during path construction.

From the results, we ob- serve that: (1) As shown in Figure 2(a), increasing k initially leads to performance gains, which then stabilize before ex- periencing a slight decline. While larger & values encourage broader relational exploration, they may also introduce ir- relevant candidates and increased computational cost. Con- versely, smaller & restrict the diversity of the search. To bal- ance these trade-offs, we select a moderate k = 3 as the default setting. (2) As shown in Figure 2(b), on the WebQSP dataset, performance improves from L = 2 to 3, then fluctu- ates between L = 3 and 5, suggesting limited gains beyond three hops. In contrast, performance on the CWQ dataset steadily increases up to L = 4 before slightly declining at L = 5, reflecting its need for deeper reasoning due to more complex questions. Balancing effectiveness and efficiency across both datasets, we set L = 4 as the default path length in all experiments. More results are provided in Appendix E. Impact of Different LLMs To evaluate the impact of different LLM-based plan- ners within the DAMR framework, we compare several backbones including Llama2 13B (Roque 2025), Qwen3 14B (Team 2024), GPT 4.1 mini, and GPT 4.1, as shown in Table 4. Across both datasets, stronger LLMs consistently yield higher F1 and Hits scores, with GPT 4.1 achieving the best performance on all metrics. This highlights the criti- cal role of advanced LLMs in guiding relation selection and reasoning path expansion. The results confirm that improved language modeling and semantic understanding capabilities directly enhance KGQA accuracy. Overall, these findings emphasize the importance of backbone selection and fur- ther validate the design of DAMR, which leverages powerful LLMs for robust and effective multi-hop reasoning. Case study Table 5 presents a case study comparing the reasoning pro- cess of DAMR with four general LLMs: Llama-2-13B, Qwen-3-14B, GPT 4.1-mini, and GPT 4.1. While all base- line LLMs fail to identify the correct structure that opened in Hollywood in 1922, the proposed DAMR accurately finds Grauman’s Egyptian Theatre by explicitly traversing relation paths in the knowledge graph from two different reasoning paths. This example demonstrates that, although LLMs appear capable of answering the question, their responses can still be factually incorrect due to a lack of grounded knowledge. In contrast, DAMR consistently pro- duces accurate and faithful answers by grounding its reason- ing in KG and explicitly modeling reasoning paths. More studies can be found in Appendix E. Conclusion In this work, we present DAMR, a dynamically adap- tive MCTS-based reasoning framework for complex KGQA tasks. DAMR incorporates an LLM-based planner to guide top-k relation expansion, a context-aware path evaluator to assess reasoning paths without further LLM queries, and a dynamic refinement module that continually adapts the eval- uator using pseudo-path supervision from MCTS rollouts. This modular design enables efficient yet accurate multi-hop reasoning by narrowing the search space, reducing redun- dant computation, and enhancing evaluation quality. Exten- sive experiments on WebQSP and CWQ confirm the effec- tiveness and efficiency of DAMR, making it a practical and scalable solution for real-world KGQA deployment. References Baek, J.; Aji, A.

Complexity Analysis The overall time complexity of the proposed DAMR framework is governed by its two primary online stages: the LLM- Guided MCTS Search and the interleaved Path-based Dynamic Refinement. In the MCTS Search phase, executed over NV iterations, the LLM-guided relation expansion incurs a total complexity of O (N - Titm(k)), where TiLm(k) denotes the in- ference time of the LLM when provided with up to & candidate relations from the Knowledge Graph (KG). The context- aware path evaluation performed during the simulation step introduces an additional cost of O (N -k- DL. d), where L is the maximum path length and d is the embedding dimension. In the Path-based Dynamic Refinement stage, the evaluator is fine-tuned for Nery steps, with a total complexity of O (Ner -[?. d). Consequently, the overall time complexity of DAMR is: O(N: (Trim(k) +k: L?-d) + Ner- L?-d). C. Datasets Dataset Description Table 6: Statistics of KGQA datasets. Datasets #Train #Valid #Test WebQSP = 2,848 250 1,639 CWQ 27,639 3,519 = 3,531 We conduct extensive experiments on two widely used multi-hop Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) bench- marks: WebQSP (Talmor and Berant 2018) and CWQ (Yih et al. 2016). The statistics of these two benchmarks can be found in Table 6, and their details are shown as follows: ¢ The WebQuestionsSP (WebQSP) dataset is a widely adopted benchmark for evaluating single-hop and simple multi-hop KGQA (Yih et al. 2016). It consists of 4,837 natural language questions annotated with corresponding SPARQL queries over the Freebase knowledge graph. The dataset is partitioned into 2,848 training, 250 validation, and 1,639 test instances. ¢ The Complex WebQuestions (CWQ) dataset is a challenging benchmark designed for multi-hop KGQA (Talmor and Berant 2018). It comprises 34,689 questions derived from WebQuestionsSP, reformulated to include more complex and composi- tional queries. Each question typically requires multi-step reasoning over the Freebase knowledge graph, often involving conjunctions, comparatives, or nested logical structures. The dataset is divided into 27,639 training, 3,519 validation, and 3,531 test examples. Data Processing Following prior work (Shen et al. 2025; Long et al. 2025), we preprocess the datasets by constructing localized subgraphs centered around each question entity to reduce the size of the search space. Specifically, for each question in WebQSP (Yih et al. 2016) and CWQ (Talmor and Berant 2018), we extract a subgraph from the Freebase knowledge graph by including all triples within a predefined number of hops from the topic entity. This approach preserves the essential context required for multi-hop reasoning while significantly improving computational efficiency. D. Baselines In this part, we introduce the details of the compared baselines as follows: * Semantic Parsing Methods. We compare our DAMR with six semantic parsing methods: KV-Mem: KV-Mem (Miller et al. 2016) introduce a neural architecture that stores facts as key-value pairs and enables question answering by attending over memory slots, directly retrieving relevant information to infer answers. EmbedKGQA: EmbedKGQA (Saxena, Tripathi, and Talukdar 2020) enhances multi-hop question answering over knowl- edge graphs by leveraging pretrained knowledge base embeddings, enabling the model to reason over entity and relation representations without explicit path enumeration during answer prediction.

Question Where does greek language come from? Answer Attic Group The Greek language originates from the Proto-Indo-European language family, which spread to Greece around 2000 Llama-2-13B BCE. It evolved into the ancient Greek language, influenced by Mycenaean and Aeolic dialects, and eventually devel- oped into Modern Greek. The Greek language originates from the Proto-Hellenic branch of the Indo-European language family. It evolved from Qwen-3-14B the Mycenaean Greek of the second millennium BCE and became the foundation for Classical Greek, spoken in ancient Greece. The Greek language originates from the Indo-European language family. It developed in the southern Balkans around GPT 4.1 the 3rd millennium BCE and is the oldest recorded living language, with written records dating back to the 15th century BCE (Linear B script).

2508 .00754v1 [cs.LG] 1 Aug 2025 arXiv A Simple and Effective Method for Uncertainty Quantification and OOD Detection Yaxin Ma Electrical and Computer Engineering University of Florida Gainesville, USA [EMAIL] Abstract—Bayesian neural networks and deep ensemble meth- ods have been proposed for uncertainty quantification; however, they are computationally intensive and require large storage. By utilizing a single deterministic model, we can solve the above issue. We propose an effective method based on feature space density to quantify uncertainty for distributional shifts and out- of-distribution (OOD) detection. Specifically, we leverage the information potential field derived from kernel density estimation to approximate the feature space density of the training set. By comparing this density with the feature space representation of test samples, we can effectively determine whether a distri- butional shift has occurred. Experiments were conducted on a 2D synthetic dataset (Two Moons and Three Spirals) as well as an OOD detection task (CIFAR-10 vs. SVHN). The results demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models. Index Terms—uncertainty quantification, distributional shift, OOD detection I. INTRODUCTION Deep learning has demonstrated success in numerous appli- cations such as computer vision, natural language processing, etc (3). However, one significant issue with deep learning is its tendency to produce overconfident predictions. In highly sensitive applications such as autonomous driving or medical-related fields (5). the consequences of prediction errors can be severe, as these areas are directly linked to human safety and well-being. As a result, uncertainty quantification has emerged as a critical and indispensable area of research to address these challenges effectively [6 (7) [8}. In general, uncertainty can be categorized into two main types: data uncertainty and model uncertainty (9) (10). Data uncertainty arises from the inherent randomness or noise in the data and cannot be reduced through the training process. Model uncertainty, also known as epistemic uncertainty, is caused by uncertainty in the model’s parameters and archi- tecture, reflecting the limitations in the model’s knowledge or learning capability (11). One type of uncertainty called distributional uncertainty occurs when the distributions of the training set and test set differ. Recently, distributional uncertainty has been tackled by using the model activations to simplify the estimation [12]. To quantify uncertainty in the context of distribution shift, there are two primary applications: active learning [13] and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection [17]. Active Benjamin Colburn Electrical and Computer Engineering University of Florida Gainesville, USA benjamin.colburn @ufl.edu Jose C. Principe Electrical and Computer Engineering University of Florida Gainesville, USA principe @cnel.ufl.edu learning selectively chooses the most informative training data and directs data acquisition toward regions of high uncertainty, thereby minimizing the need for excessive labeled data while preserving model accuracy. For OOD detection, the goal is to identify test samples whose distribution differ from the training set. For example, if the training data consists of the MNIST dataset, which contains only digit images, and the test data includes samples from the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains images of clothing, the model, regardless of how well it is trained, cannot provide correct predictions for such samples. In such cases, OOD detection can identify these test samples as out-of-distribution instances. Typically, from the perspective of deep learning, the model is trained through optimization, resulting in a fixed set of parameters being selected. In contrast, from a probabilistic viewpoint, Bayesian model averaging considers all possible parameter sets, weighted by their posterior probability (18). Bayesian methods utilize Bayes’ theorem to update beliefs about a neural network’s parameters based on observed data. However, directly computing the posterior distribution is often infeasible due to the complexity of neural networks. As a result, researchers have developed various techniques to approximate this posterior distribution [21]. Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout provides a practical approach to approx- imate Bayesian inference by applying different dropout masks during inference and performing multiple stochastic forward passes (22). But it has limited uncertainty representation and computational drawbacks. The ensemble method is another approach for comple- menting the model output with uncertainty estimation (23). It estimates the variance among model outputs as an indicator of uncertainty. However, both Bayesian and ensemble methods demand large computational resources for training. Addition- ally, ensemble methods require more storage to accommodate the parameters of multiple models. To address this issue, researchers have proposed using deterministic methods with a single model for uncertainty quantification [25]. By utilizing one model, deep de- terministic method try to learn the latent representation of a model or apply a distance-sensitive function to estimate predictive uncertainty [26] [27] 28]. For example, determinis- tic uncertainty quantification (DUQ) measures uncertainty by computing the distance between the model output and the clos- est class centroid using an RBF network and gradient penalty (29). Spectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Process (SNGP) enhances distance-awareness by applying weight normaliza- tion and replacing the output layer with a Gaussian Process 30]. Deep Deterministic Uncertainty (DDU) approximates the class-conditional distribution using a Gaussian Mixture Model and quantifies uncertainty through log-likelihood estimation Bi}. However, these methods rely on specific assumptions which may not always hold in real-world scenarios, potentially limiting their flexibility. DDU assumes that the features of each class follow a Gaussian distribution, which will not accurately represent more complex feature spaces. In our proposed method, we leverage the Information Potential Field (IPF), a non parametric estimator of the probability density function, to estimate the density of sample projections in feature space without imposing such assumptions. The IPF will quantify the density of the training set which is the in- distribution (iD) data, while the OOD data are the test set samples. Furthermore, unlike DDU, our approach does not require treating each class separately; instead, we compute the feature space density directly across all classes. This results in a simpler and more generalized approach, making it applicable to a wider range of scenarios while maintaining robustness and accuracy. We conduct experiments on two 2D synthetic datasets: the two-moons and three-spirals datasets. We are the first to use the three-spirals dataset for visualizing uncertainty performance, as the commonly used two-moons dataset is too simplistic. Additionally, our experimental results on OOD detection using the CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets highlight the superiority of the proposed method. II. METHOD A. Problem Formulation In classification tasks, the underlying assumption is that the distribution of the training set is the same as the distribution of the test set. However, in practical applications, the training set distribution may differ from the test set distribution, resulting in a distributional shift. If a test sample shares the same distribution as the training set, it is referred to as in-distribution (i-D) data. Conversely, if the test sample comes from a distribution different from the training data, it is classified as OOD data. In such cases, the prediction for the test sample carries a high degree of uncertainty, known as distributional uncertainty [33]. Following this definition, density-based and distance-based methods have been proposed to measure uncertainty [35]. Specifically, if a test point is located in a high- density region of the training data, or if its distance to the training data is small, the test point is considered to have low uncertainty. Conversely, if the test point lies in a low-density region or is far from the training data, it is deemed to have high uncertainty, as it represents unseen data. B. Distance Awareness Representation For most large datasets, the data space is high dimension and very complex, making it challenging to measure density or distance directly in the raw data space. Neural network models are an efficient approach to extract features. These latent features can be directly used as representations of data, and normally they exist in a lower dimensional space. The activations of the neural network layer before the classification layer, is normally used as the projected data. Therefore, it will be easier to use the feature space density or feature space distance for uncertainty quantification. In fact, the features learned by the model are not guaranteed to capture sufficient variability or distinguishability within the input data. As a result, it becomes difficult to differentiate between iD and OOD data. For instance, features extracted from OOD data may be mapped into the same regions of the feature space as those learned from iD data. This phenomenon, known as feature collapse [36], undermines the effectiveness of using latent features to measure the distance or density of a test sample relative to the training set. Therefore, we utilize the bi-Lipschitz constant to improve the quality of the the features during model training as suggested in [30]. For inputs x; and x2, Lier — cally < |lfo (v1) — fo (wa)|lz <U llr — ally, (1) where L and U are constants representing the lower and upper bounds, respectively. The function f9(-) represents the neural network model. ||-||,, and ||-||, denote the distances in the sample space and feature space, respectively. During model training, we employ Spectral Normalization (SN) to enforce the bi-Lipschitz constraint to improve the model’s ability to maps distinct inputs to distinct representa- tions. C. Informational Potential Field Let Drain and Dtest represent the training set and test set, re- spectively. The training set consists of samples (2, y;), where x; € ¥ and y; € Y, X and Y denote the sample space and label space. . Similarly, the test set is represented as (x7, y7). Let fo(x) denote a neural network model parameterized by 6, trained on Dain. We define z € Z as the latent feature representation, where Z denotes the latent feature space. For a sample x € ¥, the model maps ~ to a latent feature z = f(z). Let p(z) denote the feature space density of the projected samples at the top layer (before the classification layer) of the trained model. To estimate the probability density function of the model activations, we employ the information potential field to approximate p(z), yielding w(z) ~ p(z). The concept of IPF was introduced in and is inspired by kernel density estimation. It serves as the equivalent of a probability measure in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Here IPF quantifies the density of in-distribution projected data, forming a field analogous to a gravitational field in physics. Unlike the DDU method, which assumes the feature space density of the training set follows a Gaussian mixture model, our 2 1 oO 1 2 3 (a) Two-Moons dataset 1 ° 3 2 (d) IPF-without SN (Ours) 2 3 “(e) IPF (Ours) 0 "(i IPF-without SN (Ours) 3 2 2 3 (0) Three-Spirals dataset (j) IPF (Ours) Fig. 1. Uncertainty results of different baseline methods on the Two-Moons dataset and Three-Spirals dataset. The first row corresponds to the Two-Moons dataset, and the second row represents the Three-Spirals dataset. DUQ and DDU were selected as baseline methods, and the effect of spectral normalization (SN) was analyzed. The blue region indicates high uncertainty, while the yellow region represents low uncertainty. Ideally, low uncertainty is expected in regions covered by the training data, and high uncertainty in areas outside these regions. For the Two-Moons dataset, the IPF method clearly depicts the central uncertainty region where no training data are present compared to DUQ and DDU. For the Three-Spirals dataset, the IPF method demonstrates a precise and interpretable uncertainty region that aligns closely with the training data. approach does not impose any assumptions on the feature space distribution. Furthermore, our method does not require consideration of individual classes when estimating the feature space density. The IPF provides a density field expressed as: 1 N 2) =F GE - 4) (2) where G' is a Gaussian kernel, z is the point of interest in the test feature space, and z; represents the points in the training feature space, irrespective of their class labels. N denotes the number of samples in the training set. The field represents the sum of Gaussian functions cen- tered at each training sample, providing an estimation of the probability distribution. When a point in the information potential field has a high value, it indicates greater information, corresponding to a high feature space density. Consequently, the uncertainty at that point is low. In contrast, a low value at a point in the field signifies a low feature space density, providing insufficient information, which results in high un- certainty. In our case the data is a vector of size given by the dimensionality of the top layer of the neural network. So, we employ the isotropic Gaussian kernel: — g.||2 k (z,2:) = exp (-4 =") (3) Here, A is the kernel width, controlling the scale of the Gaussian function. By adjusting h, we can fine-tune the sensitivity of the model for OOD detection. We present the algorithm description in Algorithm 1.

EXPERIMENT In this section, we first demonstrate the performance of our method on a synthetic 2D dataset and examine the appropri- ateness of the IPF for OOD detection, and the influence of different kernel sizes. Latter, we also present OOD detection performance and validation with other baseline methods in CIFAR-10 as the in-distribution dataset and SVHN as OOD dataset. A. Dataset The Two-Moon Dataset is a synthetic dataset consisting of two interlocking half-circle shapes (moons), where each moon represents a different class. For visualization purposes, we set the x-axis range from -2.5 to 3.5 with 100 values and the y-axis range from -3 to 3 with 100 values. The Three-Spiral Dataset is another synthetic dataset. It contains three intertwined spirals, each representing a different kernel size = 0.2 kernel size = 0.2 kernel size = 0.3 kernel size = 0.3 kernel size = 0.4 kernel size = 0.5 kernel size = 0.4 kernel size = 0.5 Fig. 2. Uncertainty results on the Two-Moons and Three-spirals dataset based on different kernel size. The first row corresponds to the Two-Moons dataset, and the second row represents the Three-Spirals dataset. Kernel sizes of 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 were applied during the analysis. class. For visualization, we use the same range and number of values as the Two-Moon Dataset. The CIFAR-10 Dataset is a widely used benchmark for image classification algorithms. It consists of 60,000 color im- ages, each sized 32x32, categorized into 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes include: Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, and Truck [38}. The SVHN (Street View House Numbers) Dataset is a real-world image dataset designed for digit recognition tasks. It comprises over 600,000 32x32 RGB images of house numbers, extracted from Google Street View imagery (39). B. 2D synthetic data - two moons, three spirals Our method was initially evaluated using the two moons benchmark dataset, where 2,000 samples per class were gener- ated with a Gaussian noise standard deviation of 0.1. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of the IPF method, a new three- class spiral dataset was employed, consisting of 1,200 samples for each class with a Gaussian noise level of 0.08. We compared our method against DUQ and DDU (31). both of which use feature space density or feature space distance to quantify uncertainty. Following (31). the model architecture consisted of a four-hidden-layer neural network with residual connections, where each layer had 128 neurons. We used the top 128 layer activations in our study. The model was trained for 300 epochs using SGD as the optimizer. We use the same model for both the two-moons and three-spirals dataset. The hyper parameter in the IPF method is the kernel size, which has to be determined from data either using the Silverman’s rule of thumb or using cross validation. In our tests we employed a range of kernels between 0.1 to 1 and the best kernel size we select is 0.3. Fig. [I] shows the distributional uncertainty for both the two moons dataset and the three spirals dataset. Ideally, we expect low uncertainty in regions covered by training data and high uncertainty outside these regions. For the two moons dataset, a noticeable gap exists in the central region where no training data is located. Compared to DUQ and DDU, our method distinctly highlights this area with a clear and distinguishable blue region, indicating high uncertainty due to the absence of training data. Compared with DUQ, our method presents a cleaner, more concise uncertainty region without covering areas where no data exists. This results in a more precise and interpretable shape. For the three spirals dataset, the DUQ method provides a rough estimation of uncertainty, while DDU struggles with this dataset due to its Gaussian prior assumption for each class. In contrast, our method produces better results, accurately aligning uncertainty regions with the shape of the training data, demonstrating superior performance. The impact of spectral normalization on the proposed method is also evaluated. The second-to-last column in Fig. [I] represents our method without SN, while the last column shows our method with SN. It is evident that incorporat- ing spectral normalization leads to significant improvements, demonstrating that the proposed method, which integrates IPF with spectral normalization, is highly effective for uncertainty quantification. We also conducted experiments to assess the impact of dif- ferent Gaussian kernel sizes on uncertainty quantification. Fig. [2] presents the results obtained with kernel sizes of 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5. Adjusting the kernel size allows effective control over the model’s sensitivity and tolerance to uncertainty. This highlights the flexibility and adaptability of our method. C. OOD detection We employ the CIFAR-10 dataset as the in-distribution (iD) data to train the model, and its performance is evaluated using classification accuracy and the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) (41). The SVHN dataset is chosen as OOD data due to its distribution significantly differs from that of CIFAR- 10. During the inference phase, both iD and OOD data are selected as the test set.

Uncertainty results for the Two-Moons dataset and Three-Spirals dataset using IPF directly applied in the data space. from the trained model, we apply the proposed IPF method to quantify uncertainty. For each test sample, if it is located in a high-density region of the feature space corresponding to the iD data, it indicates low uncertainty and is classified as iD data. Conversely, if the test sample has a very low feature space density value relative to the training data, it indicates high uncertainty and is classified as OOD data. To evaluate the model’s OOD detection performance, we treat OOD detection as a binary classification task, where iD data represents one class and OOD data represents the other. The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) is used as the evaluation metric. The proposed method was compared against several popular baselines for uncertainty quantification, such as softmax, en- semble, DUQ, and DDU. The softmax entropy of a standard deep neural network was chosen as a simple baseline. For the ensemble method, we configured it to consist of five models with the same architecture but trained using different parameters. For our training model, we employed the Wide ResNet-28- 10 architecture [43], where the numbers 28 and 10 denote the model’s depth and width, respectively. We utilized the layer preceding the final fully connected layer as the feature embedding, with a feature dimension of 640. To determine the optimal kernel width, we performed cross-validation over the range [0.01, 1], selecting the value that maximized the AUROC score. The best kernel width selected was 0.35. To ensure consistent and reliable results, each experiment was conducted five times. The outcomes were then averaged, and the standard deviation was computed to assess variability. Our experiments were conducted using the PyTorch framework and executed on four NVIDIA A6000 GPUs. The training was conducted for 350 epochs, with SGD as the optimizer. The learning rate was initialized at 0.01 with a decay schedule, and the batch size was set to 1,024. The comparison results of different baselines with IPF method are presented in Table 1. Note that in our evaluation, AUROC serves as the metric for assessing OOD detection performance. As shown in the table, our method achieves a higher AUROC score, clearly demonstrating superior perfor- mance of the proposed IPF approach. Additionally, the IPF method is much simpler to apply since it does not require the presentation of each class individually. We were surprised with the quality of the Parzen estimator for the size of the layers, which means that more advanced IPF estimators will improve the results even further. D. IPF in the Input Space We also evaluate the proposed IPF method applied directly to the data space. Specifically, instead of using a neural network to obtain embeddings, we approximate the density of the training set directly from the raw data and evaluate the test samples within this density. As shown in Fig. it is evident that applying IPF in the data space achieves results comparable to those in the feature space, provided the dimensionality of the data space is small. Additionally, we conducted experiments using the IPF method on the CIFAR-10/SVHN dataset, but the performance significantly dropped compared to IPF in the feature space, which was expected because of the data dimension. Note that in this case the dimensionality of the data space is huge (32x32) so the IPF computed with radially symmetric Gaussians, which corresponds to the Parzen window method is not appropriate. IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION From the above experiment, the proposed IPF method can be directly applied to the data space if the dimensionality is not too high. This can speed up tremendously the OOD detection. However, for image datasets like CIFAR-10, we are unable to achieve results comparable to those obtained in the feature space. Neural network models provide an efficient way to extract high-level features, reducing the dimensionality and making these features easier to process further. We show that the IPF can improve state of the art results for OOD detec- tion. However, using features extracted from neural network models introduces a mixture of distributional and epistemic uncertainty. This is because the process of model training and embedding extraction inherently involves epistemic uncer- tainty related to the model parameters, which complicates the problem. Future studies on quantifying distributional uncer- tainty should focus more on data-centric approaches and aim to minimize the impact of uncertainty introduced by model training. The difficulties of the IPF estimation were expected because for probability density function estimation in high-dimensional data, Parzen estimation does not scale well, and in practice it should not be used above 20 dimensions (37). In our current work, we use the isotropic Gaussian kernel estimator due to its simplicity and as part of our preliminary investigation. There are more advanced methods that extend probability density estimation up to 500 dimensions [45] [46]. Incorporating these advanced methods willl be pursued in future research because they could, on one hand, enable more accurate density approximation in the feature space and, on the other hand, potentially allow IPF to be applied directly in the data space on image datasets. This would eliminate the epistemic uncertainty introduced during model training and simplify the challenges of distributional uncertainty and OOD detection. In summary, we have developed an effective approach for quantifying uncertainty in distributional shifts for OOD detec- tion. By leveraging the information potential field, we achieved a more realistic approximation of the feature space density. Our experiments are conducted on 2D synthetic datasets, including the two-moons and three-spirals datasets, as well as OOD detection tasks comparing the CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets. The experimental results highlight the superiority of the proposed method while the IPF methodology was the simplest (Parzen estimation). Future work will demonstrate the utility of advanced RKHS methods in this line of research. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by the grant N000142312571 and N000142512223. REFERENCES [1] Y.

In parallel, VR games have . - evolved from simulations to immersive worlds that leverage . = spatial computing, haptic feedback, and embodied interaction S< [5]. The convergence of these technologies offers unprece- s| dented opportunities to enhance interactivity, narrative depth, © emotional engagement, and accessibility in digital games [(6][7]. The core focus of gaming and simulation development on immersive experiences has generated rising interest in artifi- cial intelligence (AI) applications, especially LLMs for cre- ating dynamic and human-like gameplay [8] [9]. The explo- ration of LLMs as creative tools for virtual reality experiences has emerged because these models enable complex non-player character (NPC) dialogues and generate storylines and envi- ronments that adapt to player choices [ii]. The mod- els’ context-sensitive language capabilities enable personalized gameplay that becomes more accessible and inclusive, thus expanding educational and training possibilities and entertain- ment options [12] [13]. This research paper explores the developing relationship be- tween LLMs and VR games to determine their applications for Preprint submitted to Pre-print improving core immersive gameplay elements. This research investigates the following key questions: - RQ1. How do LLMs contribute to more emotionally intelli- gent and lifelike NPC interactions? - RQ2. In what ways can they support procedural storytelling and adaptive narratives? - RQ3. How do they affect personalization, accessibility, and user experience in immersive environments? - RQ4. What challenges and limitations -technical, ethical, and practical—must be addressed while achieving their full poten- tial? - RQS5. How can future research leverage emerging trends in multimodal AI, reinforcement learning, affective computing, and open-source tools to build scalable, ethically responsible, and emotionally attuned VR systems? To answer these questions, we conduct a comprehensive liter- ature review that examines current research and systems across six application domains: (1) dynamic NPC interactions and emotional intelligence, (2) procedural storytelling and narrative generation, (3) intelligent game mastering and adaptive control systems, (4) personalized player experience, (5) accessibility, inclusivity, and usability, and (6) challenges and limitations in- cluding ethical concerns and deployment barriers.

Background Understanding the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into Virtual Reality (VR) games requires a founda- tional overview of both technologies and their evolution. 2.1. Large Language Models (LLMs )—Overview LLMs have experienced considerable advancement in re- cent years, moving from theoretical ideas to more advanced and scalable architectures like OpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) series, Meta’s Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), and Google’s PaLM. The development of large-scale transformer-based architectures has facilitated sig- nificant progress in generating text, creating dialogue systems, and enabling procedural content generation [3]. LLMs began with early autoregressive models, which fo- cused on predicting the next word in a sentence based on the words that came before. At first, this approach was a small How LLMs are Shaping the Future of Virtual Reality area of research in Natural Language Processing (NLP). How- ever, it gained major attention after the release of GPT-2 in 2019, where it showed that transformer models trained on mas- sive text datasets could generate high-quality, coherent lan- guage—and that their output could be shaped using carefully designed prompts [14] [15] [T6}. OpenAI’s GPT models have been leading in developing LLMs, driving major progress in natural language process- ing [17]. GPT-3, with 175 billion parameters, impressed re- searchers with its ability to generate fluent and meaningful text, which led to its use in chatbots and interactive AI tools [18]. Later versions—GPT-3.5 and GPT-4—further improved these abilities by using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feed- back (RLHF), which helped the models give more accurate and helpful responses [4] {16} [T9}. In addition to OpenAlI’s work, other powerful transformer- based models have been developed. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) introduced bidirec- tional training, which made it better at understanding context and improved tasks like text classification and natural language inference. LLaMA was trained only on publicly available data, making it more accessible for open-source use. While BERT focused on deep understanding of text, LLaMA aimed to of- fer smaller, more efficient models without losing performance compared to other top models [20] [21] [22]. As LLMs have grown in size and capability, new multimodal models like GPT-4V and Large Language and Vision As- sistant (LLaVA) have expanded their use beyond just text. These models can now understand images, generate speech, and support interactive storytelling. They are also being improved to use memory and computing power more efficiently while be- coming more accurate and flexible. 2.2. Virtual Reality Games—Overview Virtual Reality (VR) gaming has come a long way, moving from simple simulations to highly immersive and interactive experiences. This progress has been driven by hardware, soft- ware, and AI advances, especially in areas like NLP and content generation. The beginnings of VR can be traced back to 1968, when Ivan Sutherland and his student Bob Sproull created the first computer-based VR system, known as the ’Sword of Damo- cles”. It used head tracking to display a basic 3D wireframe view that changed with the user’s perspective. While it wasn’t a game, it introduced key ideas, like perspective-based inter- action, that still form the foundation of modern VR gaming [25] |). The 3D Internet allows users to move around and interact with digital objects in space, rather than just clicking on flat screens. A well-known example is Second Life {26}, a virtual world where people can socialize and explore using avatars. It combines AI, 3D headsets, motion sensors, and even holo- graphic displays to create more immersive experiences [27]. After early VR experiments in the 1980s, the release of consumer-friendly devices like the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and PlayStation VR changed the gaming world. These headsets S. Ozkaya, S Berrezueta-Guzman, S. Wagner. gave players access to realistic virtual worlds with features like motion tracking, haptic feedback (touch sensations), 3D visu- als, and the use of photogrammetry [28]. As VR technology improved, games became more realistic, featuring better physics, stronger hardware, smarter characters, and stories that change based on player choices. Modern VR games now include AlI-powered characters, voice interaction, and multiple communication methods, making the experience feel more natural and immersive, like talking to real people. VR gaming hardware includes two main parts: output de- vices and input devices. Output devices, like head-mounted displays (HMDs), show 3D visuals and provide a wide field of view to make the experience realistic. These can be mobile (like Google Cardboard or Samsung GearVR) or wired (like Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and PlayStation VR), and often include motion sensors and sometimes eye tracking for better perfor- mance. To simulate touch, devices like vests, gloves, and full- body suits provide haptic feedback, letting players feel things like force, wind, or temperature. All these tools work together using motion sensors and tracking systems to deliver accurate and responsive gameplay [5]. Despite its rapid development, the VR gaming sector still faces key challenges, including high production costs, limited content, motion sickness, and hardware accessibility. The im- mersive potential of VR is well recognized, but the expense of headsets and the need for high-performance computers con- tinue to hinder widespread adoption [5]. Additionally, some users experience nausea or disorientation during extended play, often due to latency or mismatched sensory input [29]. Devel- oping VR content also demands specialized tools and expertise, creating barriers for smaller studios. These factors highlight that technical and usability issues must be addressed for VR gaming to scale sustainably. 2.3. The Intersection of LLMs and VR Games The convergence of LLMs and VR technologies represents a significant advancement in developing interactive digital en- vironments, particularly in entertainment-based and serious games [B30]. The convergence of these technologies enables de- velopers to create innovative immersive experiences, dialogue systems, and educational simulations [I] [2]. Initial applications of LLMs in VR have focused on improv- ing user interaction and supporting developers. One of the ear- liest documented integrations involved helping novice develop- ers create VR content. Tools like ChatGPT assist with code suggestions, debugging, and explaining concepts within devel- opment environments such as Unity, making the VR develop- ment process more accessible [6]. Beyond development support, LLMs are increasingly used in real-time VR environments to generate narrative content, enable dynamic interactions, and simulate intelligent NPCs. These conversational agents are especially valuable in educa- tional and training applications, where they provide adaptive feedback and act as virtual tutors [7/31]. A key use of LLMs in VR is in Al-driven dialogue systems. Unlike scripted interactions, LLMs support unscripted, context- aware conversations that enhance immersion. For instance, the How LLMs are Shaping the Future of Virtual Reality *LeamingverseVR” platform uses generative AI to cre- ate NPCs with distinct personalities and backgrounds, enabling learners to engage in personalized, natural dialogue while ex- ploring content at their own pace. Various VR game genres have integrated LLM-based as- sistants to guide players through challenges using voice in- teraction [35]. These systems offer real-time problem-solving and adapt to player input, enhancing engage- ment through natural, human-like communication. The applications of LLMs in VR span several key domains, including NPC interaction, game mastering, accessibility, per- sonalization, and ethics. Figure [2| provides a visual overview of these areas, many of which are explored in depth through- out this paper to highlight current implementations and future opportunities. | Personalized Help Agents | Contextual [ Someual Memo | inl rs [ Someual Memo | I [ tntetigent Game Masters. | [ tntetigent Game Masters. | Masters | Dynamic NPC Personalized [ Prrerrees | & Converisations [ Prrerrees | Emotionally Aware ls Culture-Aware Dialogue -_Culture-Aware Dialogue | Interactions | Memory-Consistent NPCs Accessibility Support | Accessiity Support | }——+{_Grpainy erg Meral | and Moral = Design — NPC Reactions Text-to-Speech and Speech- to-Text [Procedural Quest ——_ \ <n in VR <— } [ emigemae Aware [ emigemae tellin, Nonverbal Interactions (gaze, gestures, lip sync) [__Mutinguat npcs | [User immersion Support| Immersion [User immersion Support| Scene ee for ee Impaired Autonomous Dungeon Mastering Personalized Player Feedback Figure 2: Application areas of Large Language Models in Virtual Reality games 3. Methodology This study employed a structured literature review to exam- ine how Large Language Models (LLMs) are applied in Virtual Reality (VR) games. The goal was to identify current applica- tions, implementation strategies, and key technical and ethical challenges. 3.1. Literature Search Strategy A comprehensive search was carried out across five leading academic databases: IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Sco- pus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. These sources were chosen for their extensive coverage of peer-reviewed research in computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), and immersive technologies. Various search terms were used in different Boolean com- binations (AND, OR) to capture a broad and relevant set of studies. To improve precision, we used Boolean logic to com- bine general terms (e.g., “virtual reality”) with model-specific S. Ozkaya, S Berrezueta-Guzman, S. Wagner. terms (e.g., “GPT-4’, “conversational agent”), and excluded non-relevant acronym matches. Wherever supported by the database, double quotation marks (e.g., virtual reality”, *NPC dialogue”) were used to ensure exact phrase matching and re- duce noise in search outputs. These search terms targeted the intersection of LLMs and VR across multiple application areas such as NPC interaction, procedural storytelling, accessibility, personalization, and sys- tem performance. Table[T]summarizes the main categories and example search terms used during the database queries. Clear inclusion criteria were established to guide the selec- tion of relevant studies. These criteria prioritized recency, rele- vance to LLM and VR integration, and practical application in gaming or adjacent immersive contexts. Table [2] presents the conditions that studies had to meet to be considered in the final review. Alongside the inclusion conditions, exclusion criteria were defined to eliminate irrelevant or low-quality sources. These criteria ensured that only studies with substantial technical con- tributions and contextual alignment were analyzed. TableB]out- lines the reasons for omitting certain works from the review. While the primary focus of the research review was on recent publications, some earlier works were also included, particu- larly those published before 2015. These were not used mainly to analyze’ Key Applications” or Challenges and Limitations” parts, but served as foundational sources to explain core con- cepts and historical context in the Background section. The initial database queries returned a total of 528 records across five academic databases. After removing duplicates, 422 papers remained. Title-based relevance filtering further reduced the pool to 250 studies, which were then screened based on their abstracts. Of these, 89 papers were selected for full-text review due to their relevance to LLM integration in VR or transferable insights into virtual game design. Ultimately, 62 papers were included in the final literature review. Due to the limited number of studies focused exclusively on “LLMs in VR games,” the inclusion criteria were purposefully extended to papers addressing related topics, such as LLMs in non-VR games or LLM-powered interactions in VR simula- tions, which were analyzed to extract applicable insights. A snowballing method was also employed, wherein frequently cited and conceptually central studies were traced backward from reference sections. The distribution of reviewed papers by publication year re- flects a sharp increase in research interest, especially after 2023, peaking in 2024 and 2025 (see Figure [3). Following the full-text analysis of 62 selected studies, a the- matic categorization was conducted to structure the findings and identify primary research directions. The classification framework was based on the scope of each study and the recur- ring concepts in the literature. Studies were grouped according to their primary application domains, key findings, and the chal- lenges they addressed. Two main thematic categories emerged: e Key Applications of LLMs in VR Games e Challenges and Limitations in Implementation How LLMs are Shaping the Future of Virtual Reality [PHONE] 2021 2022 [PHONE] Figure 3: Distribution of reviewed papers by publication year. We divided these categories into subcategories based on common research objectives, technical approaches, and exper- imental setups. The classification is aligned with the structure of the literature review section in this paper, which includes: 1. Dynamic NPC Interactions and Emotional Intelli- gence: Studies that implement LLMs to enhance the re- alism and responsiveness of NPC dialogue and behavior. 2. Procedural Storytelling and Narrative Generation: Works on generating adaptive, personalized narratives us- ing LLMs, often in role-playing games or branching story environments. 3.

Key Applications of LLMs in VR Games As the convergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Virtual Reality (VR) advances, various impactful use cases have emerged across the VR gaming landscape. 4.1. Dynamic NPC Interactions and Emotional Intelligence Recent advancements in LLMs have enabled the develop- ment of more responsive and emotionally intelligent NPCs within VR environments. Modern NPCs move away from fixed, pre-programmed behaviors because they now use LLMs to gen- erate dynamic conversational abilities, emotional expression, and adaptive interaction strategies [8]. This section combines How LLMs are Shaping the Future of Virtual Reality essential research findings to show how LLMs improve char- acter behavior and dialogue delivery in virtual reality environ- ments. Emotionally Expressive NPCs with LLMs. The use of LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to give NPCs facial expressions, gestures, and emotionally human-like dialogue is on the rise. Normoyle et al., used GPT-3.5 to create facial expres- sions, body movements, and lip-syncing for game characters based on what was being said. They used the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) to guide the animations. Their study was done in a 3D point- and-click game, not real-time VR. One limitation was that small changes in prompts could cause inconsistent animations, a known issue with LLMs. Despite this, the study shows that LLMs can automatically help generate emotional character be- havior, saving time and making interactions feel more lifelike. Building on this, Marincioni et al. studied how LLMs could assign emotions like Happy, Sad, Angry, or Neutral to NPCs in a mystery game, and how these emotions affected players. Interestingly, players often reacted positively even to negative emotions, such as gratitude toward angry NPCs. This reveals how emotionally expressive NPCs can create complex psychological responses. The study shows that giving NPCs emotional depth using LLMs can greatly enhance immersion and shape the overall gameplay experience. Personality and Conversational Naturalism. Consistency in NPC personality is essential for believable and immersive in- teractions. Hasani and Udjaja proposed an early frame- work combining generative dialogue, emotional cues, and mul- timodal interaction to support personality-consistent, context- aware responses. Building on this, Zhu et al., found that users retained more information and felt more immersed when engaging with human-like avatars than abstract ones. Similarly, Tonini’s international study showed that voice-driven AI NPCs enhanced user experience through emotionally engaging and polite communication, though issues like latency and lim- ited memory reduced sustained immersion. Memory, Consistency, and Long-Term Interaction. Ensuring consistent dialogue over time remains a key challenge in AI- driven NPC design. Zheng et al., proposed a dual-memory system (MemoryRepository) that mimics human-like forgetting and summarization, allowing NPCs to recall both recent and long-term interactions. Tested with models like GPT-4, GPT- 3.5, and ChatGLM, the system improved dialogue continuity, engagement, and immersion. In a related approach, Jahangiri et al., focused on optimizing performance by combining LLMs with Pursuit Learning Automata (PLA). Their hybrid system enabled faster responses and dynamically adjusted di- alogue tone to match player preferences, balancing emotional richness with real-time scalability. Multimodal and Nonverbal Interactions. LLMs also support multimodal NPC interactions by combining voice, gaze, and gesture, making characters more lifelike and responsive. Play- ers tend to prefer NPCs that recognize physical gestures, such S. Ozkaya, S Berrezueta-Guzman, S. Wagner. as waving or nodding, and provide real-time feedback through cues like lip-syncing and state lights. Yin and Xiao analyzed 47 VR games and found that physical actions signifi- cantly enhance immersion. Players expected NPCs to respond to proximity, gestures, and eye contact, making them feel more aware and reactive. Maslych et al. further emphasized the role of feedback cues like state lights, gaze, and facial ex- pressions during conversations, which increased users’ trust and engagement. Even simple indicators during system response times, such as loading bars, reassured users that the NPC was actively processing their input. Sissler [9] developed an open- source Unity framework using GPT-3.5 that integrates voice, gestures, and animated facial expressions. The study showed that synchronized multimodal responses improved NPC believ- ability and helped players feel heard. These findings highlight that real-time multimodal feedback is key to creating immersive and socially engaging LLM-driven NPCs in VR. Across the reviewed studies, LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are widely adopted to create emotionally expressive, so- cially aware NPCs capable of real-time dialogue. While many systems simulate facial expressions, gestures, and vocal affect, most were tested outside of fully immersive VR settings. Re- search consistently highlights the importance of consistent per- sonality, emotional depth, and long-term memory in maintain- ing user immersion. However, limitations remain in sustain- ing coherence over extended interactions and minimizing la- tency in real-time environments. The integration of multimodal cues—voice, gaze, gesture—has proven especially effective in enhancing believability and player engagement. 4.2. Procedural Storytelling and Narrative Generation LLMs are changing how games tell stories by automatically creating quests, dialogues, scenes, and storylines that adjust to player actions and preferences. This flexibility shapes players’ experiences, making gameplay more immersive and personal- ized. Recent research has explored ways LLMs support story- telling, such as generating new story paths, building dynamic quests, and adapting to the game’s context. These studies show that LLMs can improve interactive storytelling, though chal- lenges with consistency and coherence remain. One study used GPT-4-powered NPCs in an interactive fic- tion game where players could speak freely instead of choos- ing from pre-written options. This led to unexpected story- lines and character relationships that the designers had not planned—players who liked exploring enjoyed this freedom to create complex and personal narratives. However, the system sometimes repeated itself or gave inconsistent replies due to memory limitations [11]. Another project, PANGeA, combined LLMs with branching logic to create quests and dialogue in a turn-based RPG. The game world changed based on player de- cisions, leading to unique and replayable stories. While this ap- proach gave players more variety, it sometimes produced plot inconsistencies, especially during long play sessions [44]. Procedural Quest and Dialogue Generation. LLMs have been widely explored for generating quests and dialogues in role- playing games (RPGs). One study fine-tuned GPT-2 using 978 How LLMs are Shaping the Future of Virtual Reality quests from existing games, resulting in a model called Quest- GPT-2. This system produced more varied and creative quests than traditional retrieval-based methods, and human evaluators found that about 20% of the generated quests were usable with- out significant edits. However, the model struggled with coher- ence, often creating quests with unclear goals or inconsistent character relationships, especially in multi-step storylines [45]. Another approach used knowledge graphs alongside LLMs to improve coherence and relevance. The system combined in- formation about characters, history, and player choices to gen- erate quests and dialogues aligned better with the game world. Human reviewers rated these quests higher for fluency and log- ical consistency than standard LLM output. Still, the method faced challenges with memory retention and maintaining story consistency over longer play sessions [46]. Further development came through a persona-based frame- work that used LLMs to generate consistent character dia- logues across different scenes. This system used “persona cards” to define character traits and “scene cards” to give con- text, which helped LLMs maintain each NPC’s personality over time. Combining prompt engineering and fine-tuning, even smaller LLMs (with around 7 billion parameters) could produce high-quality, personality-rich dialogues [47] [48]. Scene, Context, and Environment-Aware Storytelling. Recent studies have focused on how LLMs can generate narratives and dialogue that adapt to in-game environments and context. One notable system, SceneCraft, used GPT-4 to create interactive scenes and cutscenes by combining predefined templates with probabilistic variation. Developers could define scene struc- tures, and the system would expand them into coherent story events. While the generated scenes were engaging and con- sistent in individual instances, maintaining character and world consistency across multiple scenes remained a challenge [49]. Radez and Bohak introduced a system that enabled NPCs to generate dialogue based on their awareness of the game environment. Using panoramic image capture and seman- tic segmentation, NPCs could reference nearby objects and spa- tial relationships, creating more believable and immersive inter- actions. Players appreciated the added realism, but the system’s high computational demands limited its application in real-time VR settings. Li et al., proposed a schema-based prompting method for GPT-4 Turbo agents to handle spatial interactions in VR, such as pointing, grabbing, or navigating scenes. Their sys- tem generated dialogue based on environmental cues, object properties, and user actions. The agents were tested in various role-play scenarios and showed practical spatial reasoning and responsiveness. However, they sometimes hallucinated object references and struggled in more complex environments. Earlier work by HamAlainen et al., demonstrated a sys- tem that adapted NPC dialogue in Fallout 4 based on gameplay variables like health or quest progress. Instead of generating new lines, the system rephrased existing ones to better fit the player’s current state. While effective for personalization, it lacked memory of past interactions and could not support dy- namic long-term conversations. S. Ozkaya, S Berrezueta-Guzman, S. Wagner. The reviewed studies demonstrate that LLMs can signifi- cantly enhance procedural storytelling by generating dynamic quests, dialogues, and scene-aware narratives. Techniques such as fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and knowledge graph in- tegration help maintain coherence and character consistency, though challenges persist with memory retention and logical continuity across extended sessions. Systems like SceneCraft and schema-based prompting show promise in generating context-aware scenes and spatially grounded dialogue, yet of- ten face scalability limitations in real-time VR settings. Over- all, while LLMs expand narrative flexibility and personaliza- tion, consistent world-building and long-term dialogue coher- ence remain open challenges for future development. 4.3. Intelligent Game Masters for VR and Adaptive Systems Recent advancements in LLMs have made it possible to cre- ate AI Dungeon Masters (DMs) capable of managing player- driven narratives and improvising gameplay in real time. Sev- eral studies show that AI DMs can take over key storytelling responsibilities typically handled by human game masters, en- hancing the role-playing experience. For instance, ChatGPT has been explored as a DM for tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) like Dungeons & Dragons. It was able to gener- ate coherent narratives and respond to player input dynami- cally. However, the study also noted limitations, such as de- layed responses and limited emotional engagement, which af- fected player immersion [53]. To support novice game masters, Kelly et al. expanded a tool called Shoelace by adding LLM-based dialogue suggestions and information retrieval. This helped users manage scenes and improvise more effectively, especially beginners [54]. Another study focused on improving AI DMs by integrating function calling into LLMs. In the context of Jim Henson’s Labyrinth: The Adventure Game, the system used two types of functions: one for simulating dice rolls and another for up- dating the game state. Combining both functions led to more consistent and engaging storytelling, as the AI could better fol- low game rules and handle random events [55]. Research has also looked into how the personality of AI game masters affects players. Findings show that players respond more positively to friendly and cooperative AI DMs, suggest- ing that the tone and demeanor of the AI can influence both gameplay and player emotions [56]. Adaptive and Interactive AI Systems in VR Games. LLMs are now used in tabletop games and as adaptive assistants and world managers in dynamic virtual environments. One early example involved a GPT-based voice assistant in a low-cost VR escape room, which provided hints and story cues based on the game’s context. While this improved gameplay through adaptive re- sponses, it faced challenges such as response delays and limited real-time flexibility [57]. Beyond desktop and cloud-based systems, some studies ex- plored lightweight mobile VR applications. For example, Khan et al. created a multiplayer VR carrom game where players competed against an AI opponent using Bluetooth controls and How LLMs are Shaping the Future of Virtual Reality first-person vision. This demonstrated an early attempt to in- tegrate Al-driven decision-making into mobile VR platforms [58}. In more complex scenarios, LLMs have been used to con- trol multi-agent teams in adversarial search-and-rescue games. These AI agents outperformed traditional strategic planning and opponent modeling models by using advanced prompting meth- ods such as Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and iterative cue-based learning [59]. The LLMR framework furthers this by offering a modular system for managing interactive virtual worlds. It uses multiple GPT-based modules to handle scene understanding, task plan- ning, and debugging. This setup enables real-time 3D scene creation with fewer errors and greater coherence than using a single LLM alone [60]. Together, these studies show how LLMs can support adaptive, responsive, and intelligent control of VR game environments. LLMs are increasingly leveraged to function as intelligent game masters and adaptive agents in VR, capable of facilitating improvisational storytelling, rule-based decision-making, and multi-agent coordination. Studies show that ChatGPT and sim- ilar models can effectively manage narrative flow and simulate dynamic events, though response delays and limited emotional depth still affect immersion. Integrations with function calling, tone customization, and scene management tools like Shoelace and LLMR have improved coherence and flexibility. However, most applications remain experimental or limited to lightweight systems, highlighting the need for further optimization for real- time, large-scale VR environments. 4.4. Personalized Player Experience LLMs offer new ways to personalize gameplay in VR by enabling adaptive dialogue, emotional feedback, and context- aware storytelling. Personalization now goes beyond adjusting difficulty or settings—it involves creating Al-driven agents that can understand, remember, and respond to players in socially intelligent and emotionally engaging ways. While some aspects have been discussed earlier, this section focuses on broader strategies such as creativity support, player modeling, and emo- tionally tailored narratives. One primary use of LLMs in personalization is enabling nat- ural conversations between players and virtual agents. Stud- ies have shown that players remember more and engage longer when interacting with LLM-powered avatars, especially when the agent remembers previous interactions and maintains a human-like personality [38] [33]. A promising direction involves using LLMs to support player creativity. Lin et al., developed a VR brainstorming sys- tem where ChatGPT-powered NPCs acted as creative partners. These assistants offered voice suggestions, summarized discus- sions, and retrieved relevant information in real time. The sys- tem encouraged divergent thinking and collaborative idea gen- eration by understanding the ongoing conversation, turning the Al into a co-creator rather than just a tool. Tucek explored emotionally personalized storytelling, where NPCs adapted to each player’s social identity, emotional S. Ozkaya, S Berrezueta-Guzman, S. Wagner. state, and choices. These emotionally aware agents used LLMs to generate real-time dialogue aligned with the player’s per- spective, aiming to foster empathy and deeper narrative engage- ment. Other studies focused on personalizing VR experiences through familiarity. Guo et al., found that players re- sponded better to NPCs that looked or sounded familiar. In ex- ergames, avatars that reflected users’ preferences improved en- joyment and performance, particularly for more self-conscious players. These results show that even simple visual or audi- tory customization can enhance user experience in measurable ways. LLMs are enabling highly personalized VR experiences by supporting emotionally aware, conversationally adaptive, and context-sensitive virtual agents. Studies highlight that memory retention, personality continuity, and co-creative dialogue en- hance user engagement and satisfaction. Creative assistance, emotionally aligned storytelling, and familiarity-based cus- tomization have been shown to foster empathy, enjoyment, and performance. However, most implementations remain small- scale or experimental, and sustaining long-term personalization in complex, dynamic environments remains a challenge for fu- ture work. 4.5. Accessibility, Inclusivity, and Usability LLMs are increasingly used in VR environments to improve accessibility, inclusivity, and usability. Their integration sup- ports the development of adaptive systems that address diverse user needs, including individuals with disabilities, language dif- ferences, or limited technological experience. This section ex- plores how LLMs enhance VR through multimodal assistance, personalized dialogue, and culturally sensitive design. Multimodal and Sensory Accessibility. One key advantage of LLMs is their ability to generate natural language explanations for users with sensory limitations. Multimodal models like GPT-4V enable scene descriptions via text-to-speech, helping visually impaired users navigate virtual spaces. For example, EnVisionVR interprets 360-degree scenes to provide real-time audio feedback on spatial layouts and object locations [64]. LLMs also support inclusive design by enabling dynamic, user-adaptive interactions. Bozkir et al., argue that LLM- powered NPCs can adjust to different user needs through prompt engineering and fine-tuning, offering more personalized and equitable experiences than static, pre-scripted agents. VR Games for Mental Health and Well-being. Baghaei et al. conducted a design-driven study exploring how individu- alized virtual reality GVR) environments could enhance men- tal health outcomes, particularly among young people aged 18-25. Drawing on prior work by Falconer et al. [66], they implemented a VR experience aimed at increasing self- compassion as a pathway to alleviating depressive symptoms. Participants could personalize key aspects of the virtual envi- ronment, including the avatar, therapeutic setting, and avatar How LLMs are Shaping the Future of Virtual Reality behaviors. The study found that such personalized experi- ences were perceived as more meaningful, emotionally en- gaging, and safer than standardized VR therapy. Personaliza- tion—especially when tailored to the user’s identity, emotional state, and goals—was shown to enhance users’ motivation and sense of connection. These findings support the potential of iVR to provide scalable, user-centered mental health interven- tions. Baghaei et al. conducted a scoping review of 34 stud- ies that used VR to treat depression and anxiety. Their findings indicate that the majority of included studies reported positive therapeutic outcomes when VR was used as part of a treat- ment strategy. Notably, nine of these studies applied cogni- tive behavioral therapy (CBT) within or alongside VR envi- ronments, all of which reported a reduction in symptoms. The review highlighted that VR-based CBT was not only effective but also practical for clinicians, allowing for standardized de- livery, repeatability, and increased patient engagement. The au- thors concluded that VR shows strong potential for structured mental health interventions, especially when it leverages im- mersive interaction and controlled exposure through techniques like VRET (Virtual Exposure Therapy). Chitale et al. [68] presented a scoping review focused on the use of both video games and VR for assessing anxiety and depression. Out of 4566 records initially screened, 10 studies were included, split evenly between VR and videogame-based approaches. An important trend noted in the findings was that studies on anxiety predominantly used VR, while those on de- pression leaned toward traditional video games. A few studies incorporated machine learning techniques, and only two were clinical trials. Most studies yielded encouraging outcomes, sug- gesting that both modalities could be useful tools for assess- ment. However, the authors stressed the limited availability of high-quality clinical evidence and recommended closer collab- oration with mental health professionals to ensure safety and privacy in future development. Given their adaptability, conversational fluency, and capac- ity for emotionally responsive interaction, LLMs hold strong potential to enhance these therapeutic VR experiences, particu- larly by supporting personalized narratives, mood-aware guid- ance, and dynamic user engagement in mental health contexts Social and Educational Inclusion. Beyond accessibility, LLMs have shown potential in fostering inclusion for individuals with diverse cognitive and learning needs. Liet al. implemented LLM-based chatbots within VR job interview simulations de- signed for autistic users. These virtual agents offered person- alized, voice-based feedback in low-pressure, repeatable envi- ronments. The structured yet flexible format helped users build communication skills while maintaining a sense of psychologi- cal safety, an essential aspect for neurodivergent learners navi- gating real-world scenarios. Similarly, Voultsiou et al. [12] explored the use of LLM- powered assistants in VR learning environments tailored to stu- dents with special educational needs, including autism. Their findings indicate that AI-driven guidance enhanced learner en- S. Ozkaya, S Berrezueta-Guzman, S. Wagner. gagement and comprehension, especially when combined with multimodal inputs like visual cues or simplified language. However, they also observed that the current systems often lack sufficient depth in personalization and struggle to main- tain long-term contextual awareness, which limits their effec- tiveness across extended educational sessions. Additional studies on usability show that integrating natural input modalities such as hand tracking further improves inter- action quality. Geetha et al. and Krupka et al. empha- size that users—particularly those unfamiliar with game con- trollers—benefit from gesture-based systems that provide intu- itive, real-time feedback. These affordances make VR more approachable for a broader range of users, from children with learning difficulties to older adults or those with motor impair- ments. Cultural and Contextual Usability. Cultural usability in VR is gaining attention as a means to make virtual environments more relatable and engaging for diverse user groups. LLMs, with their capacity for dynamic language generation and con- textual adaptation, are increasingly being used to enhance cul- tural relevance in VR narratives. Lau et al., [34] explored this in a Scottish curling game, where NPCs used culturally ap- propriate language and expressions. Participants reported that the familiar tone and regional references significantly improved their sense of presence and emotional connection to the ex- perience, demonstrating that localized dialogue—powered by LLMs—can heighten user engagement in culturally specific scenarios. Similarly, Subandi et al. developed a VR shopping sim- ulation designed to preserve and promote Indonesian textile heritage. Users were guided by LLM-enabled NPCs through the traditional Sasirangan fabric-making process. The agents not only narrated historical context but also responded to ques- tions, allowing for interactive exploration. This use of LLMs for cultural storytelling helped users engage with intangible cul- tural knowledge in a personalized and immersive manner, sug- gesting new possibilities for cultural preservation and education through interactive AI. In broader educational and heritage applications, LLMs have been used to power intelligent virtual tutors capable of deliv- ering contextualized instruction. For instance, Ayre et al., created a GPT-4-based assistant for a virtual chemistry lab. This tutor provided step-by-step instructions and real-time support tailored to users’ actions, effectively acting as a dynamic guide. Users reported increased understanding and autonomy, attribut- ing it to the tutor’s ability to interpret the learning context and offer personalized feedback. Together, these studies show how LLMs enhance cultural and contextual usability in VR by offering adaptive, linguistically nuanced, and locally grounded interactions. This not only im- proves accessibility for diverse populations but also enriches the educational and emotional value of VR content. LLMs improve accessibility, inclusivity, and usability in VR through adaptive multimodal and context-aware interactions. Users with sensory limitations benefit from LLMs because they provide real-time audio guidance, adaptive dialogue, and intu- 10 How LLMs are Shaping the Future of Virtual Reality itive interfaces that enhance VR navigation and responsiveness. The application of LLMs shows great promise for therapeutic interventions because they create emotionally responsive and personalized VR scenarios that benefit patients undergoing anx- iety, depression, and PTSD treatments. The implementation of LLM-based assistants in educational and social training environments has enhanced communication abilities and learning outcomes and user confidence for autism and cognitive difference users, while gesture-based inputs make the system more accessible to new users. The implementation of LLMs with cultural and contextual adaptations through lo- calized narratives and intelligent tutoring systems demonstrates their ability to enhance user engagement in heritage, educa- tional, and commercial VR experiences. Future research needs to resolve essential challenges, which include deep personal- ization capabilities, sustained memory retention, and real-time system performance limitations. 5. Challenges and Limitations While LLMs offer transformative possibilities for VR games, their integration introduces significant technical, ethical, and usability challenges. 5.1. Computational and Performance Constraints Although many studies explore how language models can en- hance interactive systems, most have not yet been tested in real immersive VR settings. Instead, evaluations are often done on desktop platforms, where performance issues like latency, mo- tion tracking, and multimodal input are less demanding. This creates a gap in our understanding of how LLMs behave un- der real-time, resource-intensive VR conditions, where delays or instability can negatively impact user experience. Several studies report that using LLMs in VR requires sub- stantial computational resources. For example, Maslych et al. found that even with local deployment and optimizations like automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and behavior-state modeling, response times averaged 3.2 sec- onds—too slow for real-time interaction. Running LLMs lo- cally instead of via cloud APIs helps reduce delay, while behavior-state modeling, which defines agent states like listen- ing or speaking, supports more synchronized interactions. Still, these methods don’t fully solve latency issues in VR. Jahangiri and Rahmani observed longer delays—over 20 seconds—in LLM-based NPC systems. They combined LLMs with Pursuit Learning Automata (PLA) to address this, creating a hybrid setup that reduced response time to under one second. While promising, this approach still requires careful tuning and is difficult to generalize across different VR environments. Memory limitations are another critical barrier. As Zheng et al. point out, LLMs struggle to maintain consistent con- versations over time. Their MemoryRepository system mim- ics human memory by summarizing past interactions, helping sustain dialogue coherence. However, this adds processing de- mands, which may not scale well in complex or multi-character VR scenarios. S. Ozkaya, S Berrezueta-Guzman, S. Wagner. Making NPCs aware of their environment adds more com- plexity. Radez and Bohak used image capture and semantic segmentation to let NPCs reference objects and spaces around them. While this improves realism, the real-time processing it requires is complex to achieve on typical consumer VR hard- ware, making widespread use difficult without sacrificing per- formance. Sissler [9] demonstrated improved NPC dialogue using GPT- 3.5 in Unity, but delays from REST API calls still reduced im- mersion. The study recommends switching to stream-based architectures for faster response. It also highlights the need for expert prompt engineering to achieve natural conversations. Significantly, while LLMs enhance language-based interac- tions, key NPC behaviors—like movement and planning—still depend on traditional scripting, limiting full autonomy. LLMs offer rich linguistic and expressive capabilities for VR, but their integration into real-time immersive environments faces significant technical challenges, including latency, mem- ory constraints, and computational overhead. Even with lo- cal deployment and optimizations, current systems often fall short of the responsiveness needed for seamless interaction, with some reporting delays up to 20 seconds. Approaches such as hybrid architectures, memory repositories, behavior- state modeling, and stream-based communication offer partial improvements, yet scalability remains limited. To bridge the gap between expressive AI and immersive VR design, future work should focus on lightweight models, edge computing, and tighter integration with traditional game logic. 5.2. Ethical and Safety Considerations Integrating LLMs into VR games has led to rapid progress in interactive storytelling, emotional expression, and intelligent gameplay. However, as these systems become more adaptive and human-like, a critical question arises: Can we trust AI agents that learn and respond to us in real time? While the po- tential for immersive and personalized experiences is exciting, it also brings serious ethical and safety concerns, particularly in VR environments where users may build emotional bonds with Al characters [74]. One primary concern is privacy. VR systems collect detailed biometric and behavioral data, such as gaze, voice, movement patterns, and emotional cues. Unlike traditional web apps, this data is continuous and fine-grained. Garrido et al., [/75! showed that just a few minutes of telemetry data, like eye track- ing and EEG signals, can reveal private information such as a user’s gender, income level, or emotional state. These findings emphasize the need for stricter safeguards around data use in immersive settings. One design solution might be to imple- ment consent-aware logging mechanisms, which inform users of what data is being collected and allow them to enable or dis- able specific data tracking modalities. In addition to privacy, LLM-generated content raises risks of bias and misinformation. Yang et al., found that GPT- based agents in mixed-initiative gameplay (MIG) can produce biased or misleading stories, especially problematic in educa- tional or therapeutic games. When LLMs are used without proper moderation, they can unintentionally reinforce harmful 11 How LLMs are Shaping the Future of Virtual Reality stereotypes or distort learning outcomes. Proactive bias miti- gation can be addressed at the prompt level through controlled prompt engineering and content filtering techniques tailored to sensitive domains such as education or therapy. Waghale et al., also warn that LLMs can introduce un- fairness into gameplay, especially in multiplayer or competitive environments. Bias in training data or algorithm design may lead to advantages or disadvantages for specific player groups. Procedural content generation using big data can unintention- ally reinforce cultural or gender stereotypes. At the same time, using sensitive data to personalize gameplay raises significant privacy concerns. Another challenge is the emotional impact of AI-driven em- pathy systems. Tucek showed that emotionally respon- sive digital characters behave unpredictably or generate inap- propriate content; they can harm user trust or reinforce negative perceptions, especially when the goal is to foster empathy to- ward marginalized communities. To reduce user confusion or mistrust, transparent AI feedback systems can be used—for in- stance, by showing visual indicators when an NPC is adapting its behavior in real time. Tanksale |'7] adds that LLMs used in immersive Web3D envi- ronments pose additional risks when combining real-time per- sonalization with procedural generation. Without oversight, these systems may create biased or culturally insensitive con- tent, especially when trained on unfiltered internet data. Finally, as Damianova emphasizes, ethical considera- tions must be built into the design process, not added after deployment. Developers should take responsibility for ethical practices by integrating fairness, inclusivity, and safety princi- ples throughout the design cycle. These studies highlight the urgent need for responsible AI design, content moderation, and strong privacy protections in VR. Without clear ethical safeguards, the line between help- ful personalization and harmful manipulation becomes danger- ously thin. As LLMs bring emotional intelligence and real-time respon- siveness into VR games, they also introduce significant ethical and safety risks. Studies consistently show that privacy con- cerns, algorithmic bias, and unpredictable emotional impacts are not hypothetical—they are already emerging in practice. While adaptive AI systems enhance personalization, they also risk reinforcing harmful stereotypes or manipulating user be- havior without clear consent. Addressing these concerns re- quires embedding fairness, transparency, and safety protocols into every stage of design and deployment, particularly as im- mersive AI interactions grow more lifelike and emotionally per- suasive. 5.3. User Experience and Immersion Issues Creating virtual characters that feel truly lifelike remains one of the biggest challenges in VR game design, especially when using LLMs for NPC dialogue. At the same time, these mod- els can generate fluent and responsive language, which alone does not guarantee engaging or believable interactions in im- mersive environments. Research shows that the biggest obsta- S. Ozkaya, S Berrezueta-Guzman, S. Wagner. cles to user experience are unnatural reactions, inconsistent per- sonality, limited conversational structure, and memory lapses over time. Maslych et al., [43] conducted a pilot study revealing low realism scores (3.12 out of 7) for LLM-driven avatars in task- based VR scenarios. The main issues were minimal animations, limited to basic lip-sync and head movement, which broke im- mersion. Participants noted that adding facial expressions, idle behaviors, and body motion could improve believability. Visual feedback cues, such as state lights and loading indicators, also played a key role in maintaining user trust by signaling that the avatar was actively listening or processing input. Tonini’s international study on voice-based VR gameplay highlighted similar issues. While players appreciated LLM- powered NPCs’ emotional tone and responsiveness, they also found conversations repetitive and sometimes generic. The lack of dialogue variety and slow reaction times made interactions feel scripted rather than natural. Players enjoyed the freedom of open voice interaction, but the underlying AI often failed to sustain flexible, emotionally rich conversations over time [33]. A mixed-reality study showed that human-like avatars signif- icantly improved memory retention and immersion compared to symbolic or abstract characters [38]. This suggests that avatar design, specifically realism, expressiveness, and embodiment, is critical for building emotional user connections. However, delivering this level of engagement requires more than flu- ent speech. Multimodal feedback, personality modeling, and memory-aware systems must work together to create believable and responsive virtual characters [78]. Narrative consistency is another primary concern, especially in emergent gameplay. Peng et al., showed that while play- ers can freely co-create stories with LLM-driven characters, this often leads to fragmented or inconsistent plotlines. When sys- tems fail to remember player actions or goals, the story can feel disjointed and lose its emotional impact. These findings show that while LLM-based NPCs can deliver moments of intense immersion, they still struggle with sustain- ing realistic, emotionally coherent, and context-aware interac- tions. To address this, future work must improve animation, clarity of feedback, narrative memory, and long-term emotional engagement. Another significant barrier to immersive experience in VR is cybersickness—a form of motion-induced discomfort that af- fects many users, particularly during fast-paced or unstructured gameplay. It is usually like a physiological response marked as nausea, disorientation, or dizziness. To address this issue, the literature offers a variety of techniques designed to detect and reduce the severity and frequency of cybersickness symptoms [79]. Physiological signal analysis has shown great promise for cybersickness detection. Islam et al. proposed a deep learning-based method that uses heart rate, breathing rate, heart rate variability, and galvanic skin response to automatically de- tect and predict cybersickness severity. Their simplified CNN- LSTM model achieved 97.44% accuracy for current state detec- tion and 87.38% for predicting future symptoms, outperforming traditional classifiers. This method provides a robust, real-time 12 How LLMs are Shaping the Future of Virtual Reality solution by leveraging subtle physiological changes that corre- late with user-reported discomfort. In addition to physiological signal analysis approaches, Mon- teiro et al. demonstrated that trajectory compression rate can also be used as a marker to identify cybersickness during VR gameplay. The authors found a clear correlation between variations in compression rate and users’ Discomfort Scores, in- dicating that changes in movement patterns—such as increased rotation or erratic navigation—are linked to higher levels of sickness. A simple neural network model using compression rate and its variation as input was able to accurately predict whether discomfort would increase or decrease over time. Furthermore, Wang et al. presented a novel method for predicting simulator sickness (SS) in real time using only in- game character movement and eye-tracking data, without the need for expensive or external physiological sensors. The au- thors trained a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network on data collected from three VR games and achieved an SS pre- diction accuracy of 83.4% for players with high sensitivity to SS. Their findings support the hypothesis that intense character motion and negative eye movement patterns are strong indica- tors of SS in VR environments. While LLM-powered NPCs enhance user interaction through fluent dialogue and emotional tone, they often fall short in de- livering sustained immersion due to limited animation, repeti- tive responses, and poor narrative memory. Studies show that visual feedback, avatar realism, and consistent personality cues are essential for believable interactions. However, fragmented storytelling and generic conversations remain common, espe- cially over time. Achieving deeper engagement will require in- tegrating expressive multimodal feedback, persistent memory, and emotionally aware behavior into LLM-driven virtual char- acters. 5.4. Scalability and Deployment While many LLM-based prototypes in VR show promising capabilities, scaling them for real-world, large-scale applica- tions remains a significant challenge. Transitioning from con- trolled lab settings to multiplayer or persistent virtual environ- ments requires more than model performance—it demands ro- bust infrastructure, cost-effective deployment, and compatibil- ity with consumer hardware. As VR games become more com- plex and interactive, these demands intensify. One of the main bottlenecks is the high computational cost of real-time LLM inference, especially in multi-agent settings where several NPCs must perceive, reason, and respond simul- taneously. Techniques like retrieval-augmented generation and modular prompting aim to reduce memory load and latency, but their effectiveness is limited in fast-paced, interactive environ- ments [43}|60]. Multi-module systems like LLMR, while offer- ing improved scene understanding, often face execution delays due to orchestration overhead, including planning, debugging, and memory updates [60]. Hybrid system designs offer one potential solution. For example, combining LLMs with Pursuit Learning Automata (PLA) allows agents to learn user tone preferences and se- lect pre-generated responses instead of generating them from S. Ozkaya, S Berrezueta-Guzman, S. Wagner. scratch. This reduces processing load and supports smoother, long-term dialogue [77| |40]. However, these methods are still in early stages and have only been tested in limited, single-user RPG setups, raising questions about scalability to multiplayer environments. From a deployment standpoint, technical hurdles also per- sist. Many LLM-based VR systems rely on cloud APIs, lead- ing to latency, privacy concerns, and service interruptions—all of which affect real-time performance. Integrating LLMs into engines like Unity often requires third-party middleware and custom tools, increasing development time and limiting cross- platform compatibility. While frameworks like SceneCraft showcase the narrative potential of LLMs, they still need op- timization for real-time, in-engine deployment [49]. Memory and model management are also critical. Persis- tent agents must track long-term context, manage session mem- ory, and coordinate with other agents. Current memory sys- tems, such as those proposed by Buongiorno et al. and Zheng et al. [39], improve dialogue continuity and increase sys- tem resource demands. These systems become unsustainable in larger, ongoing game worlds without efficient memory pruning, modular retrieval, and compression strategies. Ultimately, scaling LLMs for real-time VR applications will require an integrated approach combining efficient local infer- ence, modular design, optimized memory, and seamless engine integration. LLM-powered VR games will unlikely move be- yond experimental prototypes into mainstream, persistent vir- tual worlds without these developments. While LLMs demonstrate strong potential in VR game pro- totypes, their deployment at scale faces major challenges. High computational demands, latency from cloud APIs, and or- chestration overhead limit real-time performance, especially in multi-agent or multiplayer settings. Hybrid systems and mod- ular memory frameworks offer partial solutions, but they re- main largely untested in large-scale environments. To transi- tion from experimental setups to persistent virtual worlds, fu- ture systems must integrate lightweight inference, robust mem- ory management, and native engine compatibility for seamless, scalable deployment. Beyond these LLM-specific challenges, users are also confronted with cybersickness—a more general limitation of VR environments, and this physiological discom- fort can severely impact immersion. 6. Future Directions As the integration of LLMs into VR games continues to evolve, several key areas emerge that will shape the next gener- ation of immersive, intelligent, and ethically responsible digital experiences. This section outlines promising future directions based on current trends and gaps identified throughout this re- view. 6.1. Advances in AI for More Realistic VR Gaming One of the most promising developments lies in the evolu- tion of multimodal AI models that integrate language, vision, 13 How LLMs are Shaping the Future of Virtual Reality and audio understanding to support holistic, context-aware in- teraction. Systems such as GPT-4V and LLaVA al- ready demonstrate the capacity to interpret both images and text, which, when integrated into VR environments, can lead to NPCs that see” and “hear” alongside players. These systems could track user gaze, interpret gestures, analyze visual scenes, and generate emotionally resonant, non-verbal responses in real time. Future advancements may enable avatars capable of full- body interaction understanding, dynamic emotion simulation, and persistent spatial memory across scenes, leading to virtual characters that feel more genuinely human and socially intelli- gent. Furthermore, integrating LLMs with emotion recognition and affective computing will likely enhance their capacity for emotionally attuned interactions [84]. By incorporating data from facial expression tracking, voice tone analysis, and physiological inputs (e.g., heart rate, EEG), NPCs could dy- namically respond to player moods, stress levels, or engage- ment patterns, enabling deeper player-character connections, particularly in therapeutic or educational applications [85]. 6.2. Integration with Other Technologies Beyond improved realism, future systems will benefit from the convergence of LLMs with complementary AI technolo- gies. For instance, reinforcement Learning (RL) can be used to refine NPC behavior through iterative experience-based op- timization, allowing characters to adapt over time and learn from player interactions. With LLMs’ generative flexibility, RL could support characters who evolve with players’ styles, form- ing long-term bonds or gameplay strategies [86]. Procedural content generation (PCG) is another area where LLMs can synergize with rule-based or stochastic systems to produce personalized worlds, quests, and story arcs in real time. Instead of replacing traditional PCG algorithms, LLMs can en- rich them by filling narrative, dialogue, and context-sensitive decision trees with fluid, naturalistic language. The Internet of Things (IoT) and wearable technology also offer integration potential for health-focused or location-aware VR experiences [83]. For example, LLM-driven virtual coaches could adapt content or difficulty in real-time based on a player’s heart rate, body temperature, or environment, enhanc- ing fitness, therapy, or safety applications. In a fitness game, if a player’s heart rate exceeds a safe threshold, an LLM as- sistant could reduce the workout intensity while explaining the reasoning and suggesting hydration tips. 6.3. Ethical AI Development for Games With increasing immersion and personalization come rising ethical stakes. Future systems must embed ethical frameworks directly into the design pipeline, prioritizing bias mitigation, content moderation, explainability, and informed consent [88]. This is especially urgent as AI characters become more emo- tionally responsive and persuasive, particularly among vulner- able populations such as children or neurodivergent users. It will be key to building transparent AI systems that can ex- plain their decisions, avoid reinforcing stereotypes, and flag po- tentially harmful outputs. This will also involve developing new S. Ozkaya, S Berrezueta-Guzman, S. Wagner. benchmarking tools and ethical evaluation protocols that assess emotional impact, fairness, and long-term influence in game- play, criteria often neglected in traditional usability testing. For example, a narrative-based VR simulation for conflict resolu- tion teaching would use AI characters who modify their com- munication style and cultural references according to player background and emotional state to provide respectful guidance that avoids cultural or socioeconomic bias [89]. User data privacy must also be foregrounded. With VR sys- tems collecting detailed biometric, motion, and interaction data, LLM-powered applications must ensure secure handling, pre- cise opt-in mechanisms, and compliance with emerging privacy regulations [90]. Local processing or edge computing may re- duce data transfer risks while enabling more responsive real- time AI. 6.4. Open-Source and Industry Trends The growing open-source ecosystem is accelerating the de- mocratization of LLM development and deployment. Mod- els like LLaMA, Mistral, and Baichuan offer competitive per- formance and increased transparency, allowing smaller studios and researchers to experiment with AI-driven game mechanics without being locked into proprietary APIs. Open frameworks like LangChain, Hugging Face Transformers, and Unity GPT integrations also make it easier to develop modular, customiz- able LLM agents tailored to specific gameplay scenarios [91]. In parallel, industry leaders like Meta, NVIDIA, and Ope- nAI actively invest in AlI-native game engines and toolkits for generative NPCs, suggesting that large-scale, real-time LLM integration will soon become commercially viable. The release of real-time streaming APIs, quantized model deployment so- lutions, and multimodal interfaces will further reduce latency and memory constraints, facilitating scalable use in complex multi-agent virtual worlds. Future research collaborations between academia and indus- try will be essential to ensure that these tools remain innovative, ethical, and inclusively designed. The open-source and com- mercial sectors should align around shared principles of trans- parency, accessibility, and responsible AI deployment. 7. Conclusion This paper has examined the transformative role of Large Language Models in reshaping the landscape of Virtual Real- ity games. Through a comprehensive review of 62 recent stud- ies, we analyzed the integration of LLMs across key domains: dynamic NPC interactions, procedural storytelling, intelligent game mastering, personalized experiences, accessibility design, and performance-aware deployment. Our findings indicate that LLMs significantly expand the de- sign space for VR games, enabling more adaptive, expressive, and emotionally resonant virtual characters. They support un- scripted narrative branching, real-time user interaction, and so- cially intelligent behavior that redefines immersion. Moreover, LLMs open new pathways for inclusive and accessible VR sys- tems, offering tailored experiences to diverse user populations, including those with disabilities or language barriers. 14 How LLMs are Shaping the Future of Virtual Reality However, significant challenges remain. Real-time respon- siveness, memory management, and latency limit large-scale deployment in complex VR scenarios. Ethical concerns—such as bias, privacy, and emotional manipulation—are amplified by the immersive nature of these experiences and require care- ful consideration throughout the design and testing processes. Scalability also presents a significant barrier as models must be optimized for resource-constrained hardware and sustained multi-agent interaction. Future research should focus on advancing multimodal and hybrid AI systems, integrating reinforcement learning, affective computing, and spatial awareness. Developers and researchers must prioritize ethical AI development by embedding fairness, transparency, and safety into game mechanics and content gen- eration pipelines. Collaboration across open-source commu- nities and industry partners will be essential to make intelli- gent, inclusive, and creative VR experiences more accessible and impactful. By combining technical innovation with re- sponsible design, LLMs have the potential to fundamentally reshape how we build, experience, and interact within virtual worlds—ushering in a new era of intelligent, human-centered digital play.

2508.00748v1 [cs.CV] 1 Aug 2025 arXiv Is It Really You? Exploring Biometric Verification Scenarios in Photorealistic Talking-Head Avatar Videos Laura Pedrouzo-Rodriguez, Pedro Delgado-DeRobles, Luis F. Gomez, Ruben Tolosana, Ruben Vera-Rodriguez, Aythami Morales, Julian Fierrez Biometrics and Data Pattern Analytics Lab, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain Abstract Photorealistic talking-head avatars are becoming in- creasingly common in virtual meetings, gaming, and so- cial platforms. These avatars allow for more immersive communication, but they also introduce serious security risks. One emerging threat is impersonation: an attacker can Steal a user’s avatar—preserving their appearance and voice—making it nearly impossible to detect its fraudu- lent usage by sight or sound alone. In this paper, we ex- plore the challenge of biometric verification in such avatar- mediated scenarios. Our main question is whether an indi- vidual’s facial motion patterns can serve as reliable behav- ioral biometrics to verify their identity when the avatar’s visual appearance is a facsimile of its owner. To an- swer this question, we introduce a new dataset of realis- tic avatar videos created using a state-of-the-art one-shot avatar generation model, GAGAvatar, with genuine and impostor avatar videos. We also propose a lightweight, explainable spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network architecture with temporal attention pooling, that uses only facial landmarks to model dynamic facial gestures. Exper- imental results demonstrate that facial motion cues enable meaningful identity verification with AUC values approach- ing 80%. The proposed benchmark and biometric system are available! for the research community in order to bring attention to the urgent need for more advanced behavioral biometric defenses in avatar-based communication systems. 1. Introduction In recent years, there has been a surge in novel methods for generating photorealistic avatars [3, 12, 13, 21] that can create and animate high-quality 3D human avatars with a single image or text prompt. In parallel, industry investment in avatar technology has exploded, with companies such as Inttps://github.com/BiDAlab/GAGAvatar-Benchmark 2 Real ID = Virtual ID Real ID = Virtual ID De | Avatar generation Avatar theft Impostor Impostor assumes ~~ Driver other identity [3 Target Figure 1.

Synthesia” securing hundreds of millions of dollars in fund- ing to scale avatar services which are being used by over one million users. Another noteworthy example is Meta’ offer- ing to pay users to capture their facial expressions, speech and gestures to train its Codec Avatars model [15]. These photorealistic talking-head avatars are becoming popular in virtual meetings, gaming and metaverse plat- forms. A good example of this popularity was the virtual- reality interview* between Mark Zuckerberg and Lex Frid- man in his podcast, which had nearly 3 million views. While these avatars allow for immersive communication, they also pose critical security risks for society, as depicted in Fig. 1. An impostor can steal the avatar of an identity and impersonate him or her in real time [18]. A recent example of such identity theft was a video scam in early 2024°, in which criminals used an AI-generated video of a company executive to fool another employee into transferring ~$25M USD to fraudulent accounts. This in- cident demonstrates just how difficult it is to distinguish a real person from an impersonated one. Indeed, as avatar 2https://cnb.cx/3WECHFt 3https: //www.uploadvr.com/meta-project—-warhol- codec-avatars-training-paying/ 4nttps://www. youtube. com/watch?v=MVYrJJNdrEg Shttps : / / edition. cnn. com/2024/02/04/asia/ deepfake-cfo-scam—hong-kong-int1-hnk technology improves, such impostor attacks may become nearly impossible to detect by sight or sound alone. This is the specific use case considered in this study, where the avatar stolen by the impostor is so realistic in terms of ap- pearance and voice that only behavioral biometric infor- mation, such as facial gestures, can be used to detect if the driver identity moving the avatar is the real owner of the avatar or an impostor. It is important to highlight that the aforementioned sce- nario is different than the traditional DeepFake detection scenario [17, 19, 20], in which the main task consists of simply predicting if a video is real or fake, not whether the person driving the avatar is, in fact, the owner of the avatar. In our study, we seek to explore biometric verification in avatar scenarios by addressing the following question: Can an individual’s facial motion patterns serve as a reliable biometric characteristic to verify their identity during avatar-mediated communi- cation? In the context of facial avatars, each person’s manner of speaking and emoting is distinctive and can be difficult to imitate. By capturing these subtle dynamics, it might be possible to verify if a photorealistic talking-head avatar is being driven by its owner or an impostor. To investigate this question, we design an end-to-end experimental framework that simulates real-world avatar- mediated impersonation attacks while isolating facial mo- tion as the distinguishing biometric signal. To the best of our knowledge, the only study that has previously analyzed this scenario is [16], from NVIDIA. In their study, the au- thors coined the term “avatar fingerprinting” to refer to the detection of unauthorized use of avatars. While their study reported promising results, we encountered the fol- lowing problems when attempting to reproduce it: i) the proposed method and its corresponding code is not publicly available, limiting its reproducibility, and ii) most research groups do not have access to the GPU resources required to train NVIDIA’s verification model. Our study aims to bridge these gaps by publicly releasing our proposed avatar dataset and standard benchmark, as well as exploring lighter biometric verification approaches. The main contributions of our research are as follows: ¢ A new public avatar video dataset generated using a state-of-the-art one-shot avatar generator, GAGA- vatar [3], including both genuine and impostor avatar videos. ¢ A standard public benchmark protocol for avatar verification, defining clear train-validation-test splits and evaluation protocols that are reproducible by the research community. ¢ A first exploration of this challenging avatar sce- nario proposing a lightweight, explainable behav- ioral biometric system that is based solely on the fa- cial motion patterns of the identities. Our approach is based on a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Un- like [16] that relies on high-dimensional pairwise dis- tance tensors (i.e., all-pairs landmark distances), our approach is well suited for facial motion modeling as it explicitly encodes the mesh-like geometry of the face through graph structure. This results in both spa- tial awareness (by preserving local neighborhood re- lationships among facial regions) and parameter effi- ciency, given the small and fixed graph size typical of landmark-based representations, allowing faster train- ing and inference. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Sec. 2 describes the key terminology used throughout the paper. Sec. 3 describes the real datasets and avatar video generation. Sec. 4 describes the biometric verification sys- tem proposed in the study. The experimental protocol and results are described in Sec. 5 and Sec. 6, respectively. Sec. 7 continues with a discussion and Sec. 8 concludes with key takeaways. 2. Terminology To provide a solid understanding of our research, we first define the terminology used throughout this paper (see Fig. 2 for a visual explanation of the terminology): ¢ Target Identity. The person whose appearance the avatar has. ¢ Driver Identity: The person whose facial motion con- trols the avatar. ¢ Avatar Video: A video with the target’s appearance and the driver’s motion, generated from a target image and a driver video. * Genuine Avatar: When the driver identity and the tar- get identity correspond to the same person, also known as self-reenactment. Genuine avatars represent how the avatar of a real user would appear in a virtual meeting. ¢ Impostor Avatar: When the driver identity does not match the target identity (also known as cross- reenactment), i.e., when the person driving the move- ments of the avatar is not the same as the person cor- responding to the avatar’s appearance. These avatars simulate impersonation attacks, where an impostor uses someone else’s avatar. * Genuine Comparison: Comparing a reference video from a genuine avatar against another test video gen- erated using the same genuine avatar.

Datasets This section describes the datasets used in this study, in- cluding the generation of a dedicated avatar video dataset to capture identity-specific motion patterns. 3.1. Real datasets We use two public video datasets for avatar video gener- ation. These datasets are selected as they simulate a similar environment to virtual meetings. * CREMA-D* [2]: This dataset provides 7,442 short videos of 91 actors (48 male, 43 female, ages 20-74, diverse ethnicity) performing scripted sentences in var- ious emotional states. Each actor utters 12 different ®nttps : / / github . com / CheyneyComputerScience / CREMA-D sentences with one of six basic emotions (anger, dis- gust, fear, happy, neutral and sad) at multiple intensity levels. These videos were recorded in a controlled set- ting with frontal views of the speaker. * RAVDESS’ [14]: This dataset contains 24 actors (12 female, 12 male) speaking two fixed statements with eight emotions (calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, sur- prise, disgust and neutral). All videos were recorded in a studio environment with actors facing front against a green-screen background. In total, we use the 1,440 video-only speech files from the original dataset. 3.2. Avatar Video Dataset Generation To generate our avatar dataset, we employ the state- of-the-art avatar generation model GAGAvatar® [3]. This model takes a reference image (representing the target iden- tity’s appearance) and a driving video (providing the driver identity’s motion), and generates a new avatar video that preserves the visual appearance of the reference image while reproducing the facial expressions and movements from the driving video. The resolution of the videos gener- ated is 512x512 with a black background. It is worth noting that the GAGAvatar model does not use the audio from the original videos to generate the avatars, only the visual data. For each identity in the CREMA-D and RAVDESS datasets, we first select a single, high-quality target image Thttps://zenodo.org/records/[PHONE] 8nttps://github.com/xg-chu/GAGAvatar Landmarks Extraction {GO = (VO, BOE, (a yy Temporal \—> GCN —_ © es — §$Attention J ‘ Fj Pooling a? eRe ee Re Figure 3.

Whenever possible, we select a frontal face with neutral expression, such as in Fig. 2, “Target Images”. Next, we generate gen- uine avatar videos using said identity’s target image and all of his or her real videos as driving videos. This approach al- lows us to obtain new avatar videos in which the avatar’s ap- pearance corresponds to the target identity and the avatar’s facial movements are genuinely made by him or her. This scenario would correspond to the typical use of the avatar by its owner in a virtual meeting. We then generate impostor avatar videos. For each tar- get identity, we randomly sample a subset of videos from other identities and use them as drivers. That way, we can obtain a set of impostor avatar videos in which the appear- ance is the target’s, while the facial movements correspond to other people, as seen in Fig. 2. Despite GAGAvatar being state-of-the-art, in some cases it cannot generate avatar videos that perfectly match the ex- pressions from the driving video. For instance, in Fig. 2 (left), the column corresponding to “Driver 7” shows that, for the avatar generated with appearance from “Target j”’, the facial expression is subtly different from the original video. The avatar is not frowning as much, and its mouth does not follow the original expression with precision. 4. Biometric Verification System for Avatars Our proposed biometric system is described in Fig. 3. It is based on a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model, which is fed a simplified face mesh obtained from facial landmarks that are later aggregated through time via a tem- poral attention mechanism. Our hypothesis is that this method will be able to capture discriminative intra-frame spatial patterns of facial movement (e.g., which regions move together, muscle activation patterns), while consid- ering their temporal variations via the attention mechanism. Next, we describe the key details of each part of the system. 4.1. Landmarks Extraction To focus on the facial motion patterns of the identities, we first extract the facial landmarks for each video using MediaPipe” [11], which provides 468 3D facial landmarks per frame, as shown in Fig. 4 (a). We manually select a subset of 109 key landmark points (omitting redundant or less informative points) to reduce computational complexity while covering the main facial regions (eyes, brows, nose, mouth, jawline, etc.), as shown in Fig. 4 (b). We then normalize the facial landmarks using a frame- based approach. In particular, we take the 3D position of the nose tip landmark shown in red in Fig. 4 (c), and we sub- tract it from all the other landmark positions in that frame to achieve translation invariance. Then, we scale the land- marks positions with the intercanthal distance, i.e., distance between the two inner corners of the eyes, shown in blue in Fig. 4 (c), resulting in scale invariance. 4.2. Graph Neural Networks A Graph Neural Network (GNN) is a neural architecture designed to process data represented as a graph G = (V, FE), where V is the set of nodes and F the set of edges. Each node v € V is associated with an initial feature vector € R¢ (i.e., a landmark’s 3D coordinate, with d = 3) and, through a series of L message-passing layers, the GNN up- dates each node’s features ni by aggregating information *hnttps : / / ai . google . dev / edge / mediapipe / solutions/vision/face_landmarker from its neighbors, i.e., nodes connected to it by an edge. By stacking L layers, each node’s representation ayy) in corporates information from nodes up to L hops away, cap- turing both local and global graph structure. The final node embeddings can then be pooled (i.e., averaged or summed) to produce a graph-level embedding, hg. GNNs are particularly well suited for facial motion mod- eling because they explicitly encode the mesh-like geome- try of the face through graph structure, enabling parame- ter sharing across spatially connected landmarks. This re- sults in both spatial awareness (by preserving local neigh- borhood relationships among facial regions) and parame- ter efficiency, given the small and fixed graph size typi- cal of landmark-based representations. In contrast to ap- proaches that rely on high-dimensional pairwise distance tensors (e.g., all-pairs landmark distances as in [16]), a graph representation avoids quadratic growth in input size and facilitates faster training and inference. In particular, we use Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), whose message-passing mechanism aggregates in- formation from a node’s local neighbors at each layer. This convolution-like propagation naturally models coordinated facial movements, such as simultaneous eyebrow raises or lip articulations, by allowing information to flow across connected regions. Stacking multiple GCN layers increases the receptive field over the mesh, capturing both local and global facial dynamics. These unique properties make GCNs an effective choice for learning per-frame representations that are sensitive to the spatio-structural patterns characteristic of an individ- ual’s facial motion. 4.3. Proposed System Our biometric system follows a spatio-temporal archi- tecture designed to learn identity-specific facial motion pat- terns from avatar videos. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the core idea is to represent each video as a sequence of facial land- mark graphs, process these with a GCN to encode spatial structure, and then aggregate them via a temporal attention- based pooling mechanism. Each avatar video is divided into non-overlapping fixed- length clips of T’ = 50 frames. This choice is motivated by prior work [16], which found that sequences approaching -30 frames begin to yield strong verification performance with landmark-based inputs. Given an avatar clip of length T’ frames, we first extract V = 109 3D facial landmarks per frame t using MediaPipe [11]. For each frame t, the landmarks define the nodes V of a graph whose edges F are constructed via Delaunay trian- gulation [6]. The result is a sequence {G“)}7_, of graphs that encode both local and global facial structure. Each graph G') in the sequence is then processed by a 3- layer GCN (L = 3), in which the first layer transforms the initial feature vector x, into an embedding a) ER d\) the second layer transforms ns into ni?) € Re, and the third layer transforms ni?) into rn?) € Re, being d) = d®) = 64, and d@) = 256. Within each layer, node features are updated by aggregating information from their immediate neighbors, followed by non-linear ReLU activa- tion and dropout (p = 0.3). Applying the same GCN across all T’ frames results in a sequence of spatial embeddings {hye that encode the per-frame geometry of facial ex- pressions. To convert this sequence of frame embeddings into a sin- gle, discriminative descriptor of the entire clip, e € Re, we consider a temporal attention mechanism. This mod- ule learns to assign weights to each frame-level embed- ding based on its relevance for identity verification, yield- ing higher attention weights in frames with distinctive fa- cial motion patterns and smaller attention weights in less distinctive intervals (e.g., static segments). The attention scores are applied to the frame embeddings to compute a weighted sum, yielding the final clip-level embedding. 5. Experimental Protocol For reproducibility reasons, we adopt the same train- validation-test split on CREMA-D and RAVDESS datasets as in [16]. In this protocol, all identities are split disjointly across sets to ensure that no identity in the test set (neither targets nor drivers) are seen during training or validation. The same identity can only be used as driver or target within the same split. We refer to these data splits as Dyrain, Pyai, and Dest. Next, we describe the key details for the training and final evaluation protocols. 5.1. Biometric System: Training Our biometric system is trained on Dyrain, with hyper- parameters tuned on D,,). The final model checkpoint is selected based on the lowest validation loss. Training is conducted using triplet loss. Each triplet (a, p,) consists of: i) an anchor, a, which can be any avatar video (genuine avatar or impostor avatar), ii) a positive sample, p, which is any avatar video driven by the same person as a (regardless of target identity), and iii) a negative sample, n, which is any avatar video driven by a different person than a (again, regardless of target identity). We do not mine hard or semi- hard triplets, but only random triplets. The model is implemented in PyTorch, using PyTorch Geometric for the GCN layers. We train on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, with typical training times of about 2 hours for 200 epochs, using a batch size of 1,024 and an Adam optimizer with a learning rate of le~*. 5.2. Biometric System: Evaluation For the final evaluation of the biometric system, we cre- ate verification pairs from Pes: by generating all possible genuine and impostor comparisons for all identities in Dest, as can be seen in Fig. 2 (right). For a given identity 2 in Dregs, we use a high-quality neu- tral image (target image), from which we generate a genuine avatar. We use all original videos from identity 2 to gener- ate N genuine avatar video clips, which simulate the real usage of 2’s avatar. From all those genuine avatar clips, we take one as reference clip, and we build all the N — 1 gen- uine comparisons with the remaining genuine avatar clips. We gather all other identities in D,-s,, and we generate impostor avatar clips by using the impostor videos and the target’s avatar. We then use the same reference genuine avatar clip to compare with the M/ impostor avatar clips, obtaining M impostor comparisons. We repeat this process using all identities in Dies, and using each of their genuine avatar clips as a reference clip for the comparisons. We use the scores obtained by our biometric system from all the genuine comparisons and all the impostor comparisons to obtain the performance results. This protocol explicitly tests if the biometric system can distinguish whether two avatar videos share the same under- lying driver despite identical visual appearance. In addition, as Diest contains identities that are unseen during training or validation, the reported results reflect the generalization ca- pability of the biometric system on new identities. Similar to [16], we use Area Under the Curve (AUC) as the primary metric for verification performance. 6. Experimental Results This section evaluates our proposed biometric verifi- cation system in multiple settings. All experiments use the same identity-disjoint train-validation-test splits as de- scribed in Sec. 5, ensuring that identities included in the final evaluation data split D;es, are entirely unseen. 6.1. Results on Real Data (w/o Avatars) First, to validate our proposed biometric verification sys- tem, we evaluate the performance of the system on the orig- inal test videos (i.e., the real videos without avatar genera- tion). For this experiment, we train our system using avatar videos, and then evaluate on the original videos (without avatars) from different datasets. Because these real videos perfectly preserve each user’s natural facial motion, this setup helps us estimate the potential upper-bound perfor- mance achievable if the avatar generation process perfectly preserved the original facial motion, i.e., how well our system can discriminate facial motion signatures when no avatar generation artifacts are present. As can be seen in Fig. 5 (curves labeled “RAVDESS Reals” and “CREMA-D Reals”), our biometric system achieves AUC values up to 83%, demonstrating that the pro- posed approach is effective for biometric verification using only landmark-based motion cues. 6.2. Intra-Dataset Analysis Next, we analyze the virtual meeting scenario using avatars, following the experimental protocol described in Sec. 5, focusing on the intra-dataset analysis. That is, we train and test the biometric system on avatar clips derived from the same dataset (CREMA-D or RAVDESS). These intra-dataset experiments simulate a scenario where enroll- ment and verification stages use avatars generated under similar conditions and from similar populations. For the RAVDESS dataset, Fig. 5 (left), our system achieves 69.92% AUC when trained on the same dataset. In the case of CREMA-D dataset, Fig. 5 (center), the AUC is 82.58%. This higher performance on CREMA-D dataset might be due to: i) CREMA-D dataset has a larger num- ber of identities and clips than RAVDESS, which improves training diversity by adding variability to the facial land- mark layouts, so the model does not focus in “absolute” landmark positions; and ii) CREMA-D has richer and more varied emotional expressions and speech content, which yield stronger behavioral biometric information. 6.3. Inter-Dataset Analysis To assess generalization, we evaluate the performance of our biometric system across datasets. We train on one dataset (e.g., RAVDESS Dyrain) and test on the other (e.g., CREMA-D Pres), evaluating whether the system learns generalizable facial motion representations, or overfits to recording conditions, actor pools, or expression styles of a specific dataset. We follow the same protocol as described in Sec. 5. These inter-dataset experiments represent a more realistic real-world scenario. In the case of training with CREMA-D Dyain and eval- uating on RAVDESS Dest, Fig. 5 (center), our biomet- ric system achieves 75.38% AUC, which is lower than its corresponding intra-dataset result for CREMA-D (82.58% AUC), as expected, while in the case of training with RAVDESS Prain and evaluating on CREMA-D Dest, Fig. 5 (eft), we obtain 78.78% AUC, which is higher than its corresponding intra-dataset result for RAVDESS (69.92% AUC). This counterintuitive result might be explained by the richer expressive variation in the CREMA-D test set. While RAVDESS training enforces more general motion representations due to its limited variability, the CREMA-D test data offers more diverse and distinctive facial motions, making impostor and genuine comparisons more separable in embedding space. Thus, domain shift here actually acts as a form of regularization, and the richer test-time variation improves verification performance.

(Center) ROC curves when we train our model with avatar clips based on CREMA-D data. (Right) ROC curves when we train our model with avatar clips based on RAVDESS and CREMA-D data combined. 6.4. Combined Datasets In this experiment, we evaluate whether increasing training data diversity improves verification performance. Specifically, we train our biometric system on the avatar datasets generated from combining both CREMA-D and RAVDESS identities. We hypothesize that by exposing the model to a broader variety of identities, expressions, emo- tions, and speaking styles, it would help it learn more gen- eralizable facial motion-based representations. For evaluation, we use the standard Dies splits of each dataset separately, ensuring no identity overlap with the training data. As can be seen in Fig. 5 (right), we can ob- serve an improvement in AUC compared to their respec- tive intra-dataset results, for both CREMA-D (from 82.58% to 83.31% AUC) and RAVDESS (from 69.92% to 74.66% AUC) datasets. If evaluated in their corresponding real test datasets, Fig. 5 (right, labeled “RAVDESS Reals” and “CREMA-D Reals”), the AUC obtained is very similar, which supports the hypothesis that our system works simi- larly for avatar videos or real videos. These gains demonstrate that combining datasets intro- duces useful variability that enhances the model’s ability to capture consistent, identity-specific facial motion patterns. 6.5. Explainability To better understand what our biometric system learns, we analyze the temporal attention weights produced by the pooling mechanism. An example of the attention curves over time is shown in Fig. 6, in which we include the at- tention weight curves and some video frames around the at- tention peaks for two genuine avatar clips and an impostor avatar clip for the same target appearance. Visual inspection of attention curves across multiple clips reveals that the weights tend to peak around frames close to the apex of identity-characteristic expressions, such as wide mouth movements, eyebrow raises, or other distinctive facial gestures or behavioral patterns. These peaks indicate that the system assigns higher importance to frames with rich, discriminative facial motion patterns, while down-weighting more neutral or static frames. These observations suggest that the model relies on be- havioral biometrics rather than the static structure of facial landmarks. Even though the appearance is identical in all avatar videos, the system learns to pick out subtle dynamic patterns unique to each individual. This behavior confirms our design hypothesis that tem- poral attention can automatically identify and emphasize the most informative facial motion patterns without requir- ing predefined expression labels, facial gesture or action units detection, or any alternative method for facial gesture detection. It also provides intuitive explainability, helping users understand which parts are driving verification. 7. Discussion Our experiments show that facial motion-based bio- metric verification is feasible even in challenging avatar- mediated scenarios. Across multiple settings and datasets, our proposed biometric system has achieved AUC values surpassing 80% in the best cases. It is worth noting that our system exclusively focuses on landmarks alone, with- out using any facial appearance cues or conventional Deep- Fake detection features. This is a key design choice: in real avatar-mediated communication, all users share the same high-quality rendering pipeline, and appearance artifacts will not distinguish impostors from genuine users. Our dataset generation strategy (using impostor avatars that perfectly match the victim’s appearance) forces the ver- ification model to focus exclusively on behavioral facial motion patterns rather than static facial structure. If we had simply used the original real videos, the model could triv- Genuine Avatar Clip 1 0.10 0.05 Attention 0.00 Genuine Avatar Clip 2 Attention 0.0 Impostor Avatar Clip 0.100 0.075 ion 0.050 Attent 0.025 1 10 20 30 40 50 Frame Figure 6. Example of attention weights obtained for two genuine avatar videos (first and second row) and one impostor avatar video (bottom row) for an identity from the RAVDESS dataset: The attention weights peak at frame Tmax *%, around frames with characteristic facial gestures from the underlying identity. In this case, the woman shows very similar facial expressions in the frames with highest attention values in both genuine videos. In the third row, the impostor avatar is making a facial gesture around frame Tyaz that is probably distinctive from the real underlying impostor identity, not the target identity. ially rely on differences in facial geometry to verify identi- ties. Such structural cues would be useless in a real attack scenario, where a stolen avatar would exactly replicate the victim’s face. By constructing impostor avatars, we ensure the model is trained on the realistic and challenging prob- lem of detecting who is driving the avatar’s movements. Compared to the only other published system for this task [16], which reports up to 87% AUC using a propri- etary model trained on three datasets, our approach remains competitively despite using fewer data and GPU resources. Our biometric system is also lighter with reduced compu- tational complexity, and provides explainability through the temporal attention weights revealing which frames and ex- pressions the model considers most informative. This posi- tive aspect is crucial, as described in the literature [4, 5]. One limitation of our biometric system is its exclusive reliance on landmark-based representations: while inter- pretable and efficient, they depend on the quality of the landmark estimator. We have used MediaPipe [11], a widely adopted and robust model, but inaccuracies can oc- cur, especially under challenging poses or expressions, po- tentially reducing verification accuracy. Another limitation is inherent to the avatar generation process itself. While GAGAvatar represents the state-of- the-art in one-shot talking-head synthesis [3], it does not always faithfully reproduce subtle or extreme facial expres- sions from the driver. Improving avatar generation fidelity, particularly in capturing fine-grained facial dynamics, could directly benefit biometric performance. 8. Conclusions In this work, we have introduced the challenge of biometric verification in photorealistic talking-head avatar videos, where impostors can perfectly impersonate a vic- tim’s appearance. We have proposed a lightweight, explain- able system based solely on facial landmarks’ motion, using a spatio-temporal GCN with temporal attention-based pool- ing to learn discriminative behavioral signatures. In addition to the proposed biometric system and code, we have also released a public standard benchmark of gen- uine and impostor avatar videos for this scenario. Our ex- periments have preliminary shown that facial motion pat- terns are effective biometric cues, demonstrating the poten- tial of behavioral biometrics as a defense against avatar- based impersonation. Future work will be oriented to im- prove the performance through novel deep learning archi- tectures [7, 9, 10] and loss functions [1, 8] and the evalu- ation of the biometric system under more challenging sce- narios and avatar generation models [3, 12, 13, 21].

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive contexts where fairness and inclusivity are critical. Pronoun usage, especially concerning gender-neutral and neopronouns, remains a key challenge for responsible AI. Prior work, such as the MISGEN- DERED benchmark, revealed significant limitations in earlier LLMs’ handling of inclusive pronouns, but was constrained to outdated models and limited evaluations. In this study, we introduce MISGENDERED4, an extended and updated benchmark for evaluating LLMs’ pronoun fidelity. We benchmark five representative LLMs, GPT-40, Claude 4, DeepSeek-V3,Qwen Turbo and Qwen2.5, across zero-shot, few-shot, and gender identity inference. Our results show notable improvements com- pared with the previous studies, especially in binary and gender-neutral pronoun accuracy. However, accuracy on neopronouns and reverse infer- ence tasks remains inconsistent, underscoring persistent gaps in identity- sensitive reasoning. We discussed implications, model-specific observa- tions, and avenues for future inclusive AI research. Keywords: LLMs - Pronoun Bias - Fairness - Gender-Inclusive 1 Introduction In recent years, responsible artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a central concern across both research and policy domains, driven by growing awareness of the ethical and societal impacts of AI technologies. This focus is reflected in global initiatives such as the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence [26], the European Union’s AI Act [6], and the OECD * Xushuo Tang and Yi Ding contributed equally to this work. 2 X. Tang et al. AI Principles [16]. These frameworks emphasize key ethical pillars, including fairness, inclusivity, transparency, accountability, and non-discrimination, par- ticularly in applications involving sensitive personal attributes. Reducing algo- rithmic bias, promoting model explainability, and safeguarding identity-related information are increasingly recognized as essential requirements for deploying trustworthy AI systems. At the same time, large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o0 and Claude 4 have achieved better performance across diverse NLP tasks, including summarization, question answering, code generation, and multi- turn dialogue. However, concerns persist regarding their equitable treatment of gendered language, where even advanced models continue to exhibit biases, pos- ing challenges to fairness and inclusivity in real-world deployment. The study of gender bias in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has a long- standing history, beginning with word embedding analyses that uncovered stereo- typical associations between gender and occupations [3]. Benchmarks such as WinoBias/29] and Winogender[21] revealed gender misattributions in corefer- ence systems and earlier LLMs. Additional surveys continue to highlight social biases in embeddings, generation outputs, and downstream applications [8, 28]. However, most prior work has focused narrowly on binary gender distinctions, often neglecting the complexities of gender-neutral pronouns (e.g., they/them) and neopronouns (e.g., ze/zem). The MISGENDERED benchmark [9] thus was recently introduced to evaluates LLMs’ accuracy in using gender-neutral and neopronouns within masked-fill templates. Their results, based on pre-2023 models, revealed major limitations, with average neopronoun accuracy as low as 8% and little improvement even under few-shot prompting conditions. Motivation. Ensuring fairness in gender-inclusive language remains a criti- cal challenge for modern large language models (LLMs). While the MISGEN- DERED benchmark [9] represented a significant step toward evaluating LLMs’ handling of gender-neutral and neopronouns, it falls short of capturing the evolv- ing landscape of model capabilities and fairness requirements. Two key limita- tions of the original framework motivate our work: — Limited Benchmark Tasks. The original MISGENDERED benchmark focused exclusively on evaluating models’ ability to fill in masked pronouns based on ex- plicitly stated gender identities in surrounding text. This design tests whether a model can apply the correct pronoun once the identity is declared. However, this one-directional task does not capture the full range of gender-related rea- soning needed for responsible AI auditing. In many real-world applications, such as content moderation, automated summarization, and virtual assistant inter- actions, models must infer a speaker’s or referent’s gender identity based solely on how pronouns are used, without being explicitly told. This reverse inference task, which we term Gender Identity Inference, evaluates whether LLMs can de- duce gender declarations from contextual usage of pronouns like “they,” “xe,” or “ze.” The original benchmark did not address this dimension of fairness auditing, leaving a critical gap in evaluating pronoun consistency, bias reversibility, and latent misattribution errors. An Updated Evaluation on Nonbinary Pronoun Handling in LLMs 3 — Outdated Model Evaluation The original MISGENDERED study was con- ducted using models such as GPT-2 and other pre-2023 architectures, which were neither instruction-tuned nor enhanced with modern alignment techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). These earlier mod- els lacked the architectural advancements and human-centric safety alignment seen in today’s large-scale language models like GPT-40, Claude 4, or Deepseek V3. Consequently, the performance results reported in the original benchmark are no longer representative of current LLM capabilities. Given the rapid evolu- tion of transformer-based models in terms of context length, reasoning ability, and sensitivity to ethical considerations, it is crucial to revisit this benchmark with more powerful and safety-aligned models to understand whether progress in model development has translated into improved handling of gender-diverse pronouns and more inclusive language behavior. Contributions. To address these limitations and advance inclusive LLM evalua- tion, we present an updated and extended version of the MISGENDERED study. Our evaluation introduces new experimental dimensions, higher-performing mod- els, and a gender identity inference benchmark to probe deeper manifestations of bias behaviors. Our contributions are as follows: — New Benchmark Dataset. We propose MISGENDERED,4, an enhanced and publicly extensible benchmark that significantly expands the original dataset with newly crafted templates, diverse pronoun forms (including various neopro- nouns), and a broader set of curated name-pronoun mismatches. This supports more fine-grained analysis of pronoun fidelity and nuanced bias behavior. — Modern LIMs Evaluations. We evaluate five recent and diverse LLMs, GPT- 4o [15], Claude-4-Sonnet [24], Qwen2.5-72B [27], Qwen-Turbo [23], and DeepSeek- V3 [25], spanning both commercial and open-source models. These models differ in scale, training objectives, strategies, and language coverage, allowing us to analyze performance variation across architectural and institutional designs. — Gender Identity Inference Task. We design a novel task to test models’ ability to infer gender identity from pronoun usage, reversing the direction of traditional pronoun prediction benchmarks. This task reveals how models associate linguis- tic cues with identity categories, shedding light on implicit biases reasoning. — New Findings & Future Directions. Our experiments uncover several notable trends: (1) high alignment models outperform in neopronoun handling, (2) mul- tilingual models show weaker English-centric pronoun grounding, and (3) most models remain vulnerable to name-based gender bias. These findings provide valuable guidance for future fairness auditing and model improvement. 2 Background 2.1 Pronoun Bias Pronoun bias refers not only to technical disparities in NLP systems but also to pervasive social inequities in how pronouns are used to reflect and undermine 4 X. Tang et al. gender identity recognition. Misgendering, using pronouns or names inconsistent with a person’s identity, is often experienced as a microaggression, leading to emotional distress, reduced agency, and systemic marginalization [20]. Pronoun usage carries profound implications for identity affirmation. Mis- gendering is increasingly understood as a form of epistemic injustice: denying someone’s self-identification diminishes their social legitimacy [2]. Sociolinguistic studies have shown that transgender, non-binary, and gender-diverse individuals experience higher rates of psychological distress, such as anxiety or depression, when repeatedly misgendered [10, 4]. In healthcare and public services, misgen- dering also contributes to reduced access and trust in institutions [1]. A nuanced understanding of pronoun bias requires distinguishing among [9]: — Binary pronouns: he/him/his/himself, she/her/hers/herself. These are traditional gendered pronouns corresponding to the binary categories of male and female. They are the most commonly represented in natural language corpora and are widely understood both socially and computationally. Their extensive usage has led to relatively high LLM accuracy in resolving and generating such pronouns, but also to the reinforcement of gender stereotypes when models over- associate certain roles or attributes with binary gender. — Gender-neutral pronouns: singular they/them/their/theirs/themself. Orig- inally used as a plural pronoun, “they has gained widespread acceptance in re- cent decades as a singular pronoun to refer to individuals who identify outside the male/female binary or whose gender is unknown or unspecified. Its growing presence in inclusive writing guidelines (e.g., APA, MLA, and various journalistic standards) reflects broader societal acceptance. Computationally, models often struggle with ambiguity due to “they” functioning as both singular and plural, posing challenges for co-reference resolution and context-aware generation. — Neopronouns: emerging forms such as xe/xem/xyr/xyrs/xemself etc. Neopro- nouns are recently coined or reclaimed pronoun forms created to offer alternatives beyond the binary and traditional gender-neutral options. These are often used by individuals who feel that existing pronouns do not adequately express their identity. While valid and increasingly adopted in LGBTQ+ communities, they remain rare in training corpora, leading to significantly lower performance in LLMs. Their novel morphology and lack of frequency in common datasets also result in tokenization and modeling difficulties. A list of commonly used binary, gender-neutral, and neopronouns are listed in Table 1. While binary pronouns are typically well-represented in training data and handled reliably by NLP models, gender-neutral and neopronouns remain rare-resulting in lower accuracy, inconsistency, and pronounced misgendering in both technological and social contexts. 2.2. Pronoun Bias in LLMs The issue of pronoun bias was first identified in earlier NLP systems that re- lied heavily on syntactic and rule-based models.

Benchmarks like WinoBias [29] and Winogen- der [21] were subsequently introduced to test the fairness of coreference resolu- tion systems. These datasets used parallel sentence structures with controlled gender and occupation variables to expose models’ preference for stereotypical gender assignments. Despite advancements in deep learning, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, BERT, and T5 continue to exhibit pronoun-related biases. These models are trained on massive web-scale corpora that replicate societal imbalances, and they often default to binary pronouns in ambiguous contexts. Furthermore, inclusive pronouns, especially neopronouns, are frequently tokenized into subword fragments by byte pair encoding (BPE) and similar schemes, impairing their representation in model inputs and out- puts [17]. The MISGENDERED benchmark [9] was developed to evaluate LLMs on their ability to correctly use declared pronouns in context, with a particular focus on non-binary and neopronouns. The study revealed alarmingly low per- formance on neopronouns in zero-shot settings, with accuracy dropping below 10%. Even gender-neutral pronouns like “they“ posed challenges, with models misattributing or substituting them with binary alternatives. 3 The MISGENERDERED Benchmark Overview and Motivation. The MISGENDERED benchmark [9] was devel- oped to systematically evaluate how well LLMs respect and apply user-declared pronouns, with a particular focus on gender-neutral and neopronoun usage. Mo- tivated by growing concerns around misgendering and pronoun fidelity in gener- ative language models, this benchmark addresses a critical fairness dimension in responsible AI development. Prior studies had predominantly focused on binary gender forms, leaving a significant gap in evaluating models on non-binary and underrepresented identities. MISGENDERED aims to close this gap by pro- 6 X. Tang et al. Declaration: Aamari’s pronouns are xe/xem/xyr/xyrs/xemself Pronoun form: Nominative Input: Aamari was very stoic.

Task Design. Each test instance in MISGENDERED follows a structured two-part format. The first sentence explicitly declares an individual’s pronouns (e.g., “Aamari’s pronouns are re/rem/xyr/xyrs/zemself.”). The second sentence presents a naturalistic context containing a masked placeholder [PRONOUN], which the model is asked to fill in with the correct grammatical form. The benchmark covers five grammatical forms, nominative, accusative, possessive- dependent, possessive-independent, and reflexive, with ten distinct syntactic templates per form. This diversity ensures coverage of various linguistic pat- terns and co-reference scenarios encountered in real-world usage. Dataset Construction. The MISGENDERED benchmark contains over 3.8 million templated instances, systematically designed to assess LLMs’ pronoun fidelity across a diverse range of gender identities. These instances span three primary pronoun categories: (1) Binary pronouns, (2) Gender-neutral pronouns, and (3) Neopronouns, as detailed in Section 2. Each example begins with an ex- An Updated Evaluation on Nonbinary Pronoun Handling in LLMs 7 plicit pronoun declaration, followed by a contextual sentence containing a masked slot [PRONOUN] that the model is asked to complete appropriately. Templates are manually constructed to span five core grammatical forms: nominative, ac- cusative, possessive-dependent, possessive-independent, and reflexive. For each grammatical form, ten natural-sounding sentence templates are authored and instantiated across a pool of names categorized by gender association (male, fe- male, and unisex). This generation process results in a high-coverage test set that balances syntactic diversity with identity variation. Example 1. Figure 1 illustrates representative input-output pairs for the neo- pronoun set “xe/xem/xyr/xyrs/xemself,” covering all five grammatical forms. Empirical Results and Limitations. As originally reported, LLM perfor- mance varied significantly by pronoun type. Zero-shot prompting yielded approx- imately 75.9% accuracy for binary pronouns, 31.0% for gender-neutral pronouns, and only 7.6% for neopronouns. Few-shot prompting improved neopronoun accu- racy to 45-65%, but gains plateaued beyond six examples, revealing limitations in generalization. While MISGENDERED establishes a strong foundation for pronoun-specific evaluation, it also exhibits notable limitations. It is narrowly fo- cused on forward-generation accuracy, that is, filling in correct pronouns without considering reverse tasks such as deducing identity from usage or disambiguating competing pronoun candidates. Furthermore, while name diversity is incorpo- rated, the benchmark does not explicitly evaluate gender-pronoun mismatches or biases, limiting its scope in intersectional fairness analysis. 4 Benchmark Revisited - MISGENDERED+ To address the limitations of the original MISGENDERED benchmark and support more comprehensive analysis of LLMs’ pronoun capabilities, we intro- duce MISGENDERED4, an enhanced benchmark suite. This includes a novel task, Gender Identity Inference, which evaluates whether LLMs can infer gender identity from pronoun usage in context. Gender Identity Inference Design. The Gender Identity Inference task builds on methodologies from bias auditing research. Rather than asking models to generate appropriate pronouns (as in forward prediction), this task reverses the prompt: given a sentence containing a pronoun and a name, the model must infer the most likely gender identity of the subject. This format allows us to iso- late interpretive bias, probing whether a model can correctly respect the gender implication of the pronoun used, even when name-based priors might conflict. For instance, in the mismatched prompt “Alex was very emotional. Xe cried loudly and often,” the correct answer is non-binary, despite the name "Alex" often being interpreted as masculine. Conversely, matched prompts like “ Abigail was very outgoing. She likes swimming” reinforce typical name-pronoun pairings. Each test case requires the model to select exactly one of three options: A) Male, B) Female, or C) Non-binary, and respond using only the corresponding letter. This constraint avoids explanation leakage and emphasizes pure classification behavior based on the pronoun signal. 8 X. Tang et al. Male Name Female Name Neutral Name/Total Male Pronoun = |600(Matched) [PHONE] Female Pronoun 600 600(Matched) [PHONE] Neopronoun [PHONE] 5400(Matched) | 16200 Total [PHONE] 6600 19800 Table 2: Gender Identity Inference Data Size Dataset. As shown in Table 2, the dataset comprises 19,800 instances, con- structed by systematically varying pronoun type (male, female, neopronoun) and name type (male, female, neutral). A group of instances is templated using 20 names and 30 sentence structures. Each category contains several groups of such instances. Pronoun mismatches are intentionally introduced to challenge stereo- typical associations. Matched combinations (e.g., female name with she/her) provide baseline examples aligned with societal expectations. Mismatched com- binations (e.g., male name with neopronoun) test whether models default to name-based priors or appropriately respect the pronoun. The dataset is balanced across all name types, enabling controlled comparative evaluation. Evaluation Framework. Each instance follows a standard prompt structure. Models are evaluated based on their ability to infer the correct identity label, based on the pronoun used in the sentence, while intentionally disregarding any gender implications. Example 2. Figure 2 presents representative input examples from the Gender Identity Inference task. In the first case, the model is given a sentence with a traditionally masculine name (“Alex”) and a neopronoun (“Xe”) and is prompted to choose the most likely gender identity. The correct answer is “C” (Non-binary), as dictated by the pronoun, but the model incorrectly selects “A” (Male), reveal- ing a bias toward name-based inference. In the second case, the sentence aligns a feminine name (“Abigail”) with a she/her pronoun, forming a matched condi- tion. The model correctly selects “B” (Female), demonstrating correct alignment between pronoun usage and identity inference. This task probes a different facet of pronoun handling than standard fill- in-the-blank or coreference resolution tasks, it evaluates interpretive alignment rather than syntactic generation. It also allows researchers to investigate re- verse biases: whether models tend to override explicit pronoun cues in favor of name-based heuristics. As such, the gender identity inference task offers a criti- cal lens into model assumptions and implicit bias mechanisms, especially when dealing with underrepresented or non-traditional pronoun forms. By contrasting matched and mismatched outcomes across model families, we gain insight into how robustly each model respects pronoun declarations and avoids stereotypical mappings, a central concern for fairness in identity-related tasks.

Answer: |} Model: B J 5) Fig. 2: Sample prompt from the gender identity inference task 5 Experiments and Results 5.1 Experimental Setup We designed three complementary experiments to evaluate the fidelity and ro- bustness of LLMs in pronoun handling tasks: Zero-shot prompting: Each instance includes only a pronoun declaration (e.g., “Aamari’s pronouns are xe/xem/xyr/zyrs/cemself”) followed by a masked sen- tence with [PRONOUN] as a placeholder. Models must infer the correct pronoun form without additional examples. Few-shot prompting: In addition to the declaration, contextual in-context exam- ples are provided. The original MISGENDERED study experimented with 0, 2, 4, 6, 10 and 20 examples; however, accuracy improvements plateaued at 6 examples. By exposing the model to labeled examples, we aim to improve its pronoun interpretation through in-context learning, simulating a low-resource training scenario without explicit fine-tuning. Gender Identity Inference: This reverse task requires models to predict the pro- noun declaration from example usage patterns. To test model biases, we system- 10 X. Tang et al. atically construct enhanced gender identity inference part based on gendered name associations and pronoun types. This experiment expands on MISGEN- DERED by using an augmented dataset (MISGENDERED+) containing new combinations designed to probe misattribution errors. 5.2 Models Evaluated We evaluate five high-performance large language models (LLMs), encompassing both proprietary and open-source architectures, to benchmark their performance in inclusive pronoun handling: — GPT-4o0 (OpenAI, 2025) [15] A multimodal flagship model from Ope- nAI, GPT-4o is optimized for fast response time and high alignment quality. It demonstrates strong generalization across a range of tasks and languages, with excellent latency performance and reasoning capacity. — Claude-4-Sonnet (Anthropic, 2025) [24] Designed with a safety-first alignment philosophy, Claude-4-Sonnet excels in tasks requiring nuanced reason- ing, human preference modeling, and ethical decision-making. It is well-suited for applications where interpretability and value sensitivity are critical. — Qwen2.5-72B (Alibaba, 2024) [27] A large-scale open-source LLM with 72 billion parameters, Qwen2.5 is trained on diverse multilingual corpora and instruction-tuned for general-purpose reasoning. It offers strong performance on standard NLP benchmarks and is capable of effective in-context learning. — Qwen-Turbo (Alibaba, 2025) [23] A smaller and more efficient sibling of Qwen2.5, Qwen-Turbo is optimized for low latency and resource-constrained environments. Despite its compact size, it performs well on common tasks and is designed for real-time applications. — DeepSeek-V3 (DeepSeek, 2025) [25] An open-source model designed with multimodal extensions and a large-scale pretraining corpus. DeepSeek-V3 emphasizes efficiency and broad task coverage, although prior studies suggest it may face limitations in specialized linguistic domains. All models were accessed via their official APIs with model checkpoints up- dated as of July 2025. To ensure consistency and reproducibility, our experiments were deployed using an internal benchmarking service that automated querying, decoding, logging, and evaluation workflows for all tested systems. 5.3. Experiment Results Expl - Performance by Pronouns Zero-shot VS Few-shot. We inves- tigate how different large language models (LLMs) handle pronoun resolution under zero-shot and few-shot prompting settings across a diverse set of gen- dered, gender-neutral, and neopronouns, as shown in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively. According to the results, few-shot prompting significantly boosts performance across all evaluated models, though the degree of improvement An Updated Evaluation on Nonbinary Pronoun Handling in LLMs 11 Pronouns Models he she they ze e co ae ey xe_ thon vi GPT-4o0 96.3 95.2 98.2 97.1 96.9 98.3 95.8 98.9 96.1 95.9 95.3 Claude-4-Sonnet|90.2 94.1 99.1 99.4 94.7 99.4 97.0 99.4 100 99.8 92.9 DeepSeek-V3 21.0 15.7 24.0 31.2 14 49.9 17.2 27.9 46.5 70.0 1.2 Qwen-Turbo 88.8 88.8 64.4 70.4 50.8 73.1 73.5 61.4 55.7 49.1 60.1 Qwen2.5-72B 87.3 86.4 94.2 80.2 64.9 74.5 69.8 85.4 71.5 78.7 66.4 Table 3: Accuracy(%) by Pronouns for LLMs (Zero-shot) Pronouns Models he she they ze e co ae ey xe_ thon vi GPT-4o0 93.3 95.9 99.4 98.8 97.0 99.0 97.9 99.7 98.8 93.9 98.0 Claude-4-Sonnet |86.4 89.0 96.3 100 98.9 99.9 99.7 99.9 100 100 99.3 DeepSeek-V3 77.9 83.6 99.7 97.3 90.9 95.8 84.2 93.4 92.6 72.6 85.8 Qwen-Turbo 76.3 80.6 79.4 87.6 72.9 54.8 77.5 88.3 74.8 48.2 69.0 Qwen2.5-72B 80.3 85.1 98.4 94.5 92.2 95.5 97.9 96.8 97.7 89.2 90.4 Table 4: Accuracy(%) by Pronouns for LLMs (Few-shot) varies. GPT-4o and Claude-4-Sonnet already perform strongly in zero-shot set- tings, but still show marginal gains with few-shot examples, particularly on less common neopronouns. In contrast, models like DeepSeek-V3, Qwen-Turbo, and Qwen2.5 exhibit substantial improvement when few-shot demonstrations are in- troduced. GPT-4o performs consistently well across both settings. In zero-shot, it achieves high accuracy on canonical pronouns (e.g., he: 96.3%, she: 95.2%, they: 98.2%) and maintains over 95% accuracy across most neopronouns. With few-shot prompting, performance further improves, reaching above 99% for they, co, ey, and xe, with most neopronouns exceeding 97.5%.Claude also benefits from few-shot prompting, especially on difficult pronouns. For instance, ze improves from 99.4% to 100%, while rare pronouns such as thon and vi jump from 99% to a perfect 100%. Zero-shot accuracy is already robust across all categories, but few-shot examples help consolidate near-perfect consistency. DeepSeek-V3 demonstrates a dramatic disparity between zero-shot and few-shot conditions. In zero-shot, performance is notably poor on both common and rare pronouns (e.g., he: 21.0%, e: 1.4%, vi: 1.2%), indicating a limited ability to generalize without examples. However, with few-shot prompting, DeepSeek-V3 drastically improves across the board, achieving 99.7% on they, 97.3% on ze, and over 85% on most other neopronouns. Qwen-Turbo shows moderate zero-shot capabilities on binary pronouns (e.g., he, she) but struggles with neutrality and neopro- nouns. For example, they drops to 64.4%, and rare forms like thon fall below 50%. In the few-shot setting, we observe improvements across all pronouns, with ze reaching 87.6% and even the weakest pronouns (e.g., co, xe) climbing above 70%. Similar to DeepSeek, Qwen2.5 benefits noticeably from few-shot prompt- ing. Accuracy on pronouns like they, ae, and ey increases from the 60-80% range in zero-shot to 95-98% in few-shot. The model exhibits the most improvement on neopronouns, especially co (74.5% — 95.5%) and ze (71.5% — 97.7%). Exp2 - Performance by Grammatical Forms Zero-shot vs. Few-shot. To further dissect model behavior, we analyze performance across five grammat- 12 X. Tang et al. Grammatical Forms Avg. Models Nominative Accusative Pos.-Dep. Pos.-Ind. Reflexive] Acc.

In the zero-shot setting, frontier models such as GP'T-40 and Claude-4-Sonnet demonstrate strong consistency across grammatical categories, with average accuracy scores of 96.7% and 96.9%, respectively. However, their performance shows slight variation across categories: GPT-4o drops to 90.4% on reflexive forms, and Claude dips to 94.6% in the same category. Other models like Qwen2.5 and Qwen-Turbo exhibit larger fluctuations. For example, Qwen- Turbo achieves above 91% on nominative and accusative cases, but struggles with possessive-independent (34.2%) and reflexive (52.0%) forms. DeepSeek-V3 performs particularly poorly under zero-shot, with overall average accuracy at only 27.8%, and some categories like accusative as low as 17.4%. With few-shot prompting, we observe significant gains across all models and grammatical types. GPT-4o improves its reflexive handling from 90.4% to 98.7%, and maintains high scores across other forms. DeepSeek-V3, which previously failed in zero-shot, now reaches an average of 88.5%, closing the gap with stronger competitors. Qwen- Turbo also improves from 66.9% to 73.6%, but continues to lag in possessive and reflexive pronouns. Interestingly, few-shot prompting not only raises the floor for underperforming models but also narrows performance gaps across grammatical types. The average accuracy across all forms increases from 73.3% in zero-shot to 89.8% in few-shot, highlighting the value of minimal supervision in helping LLMs resolve syntactic complexity in gendered language. In conclusion, while GPT-4o0 and Claude exhibit grammatical robustness in both conditions, few- shot examples are particularly crucial for boosting lower-performing models and achieving more balanced pronoun handling across grammatical forms. An Updated Evaluation on Nonbinary Pronoun Handling in LLMs 13 Exp3 - Gender Identity Inference. Table 7 shows the result of our experi- ment conducted for Gender Identity Inference task for five models. In this task, we evaluate whether models can accurately infer a user’s declared pronouns based solely on contextual usage. Each example contains a consistent usage of a pronoun set (e.g., xe/cem/ryr/ryrs/cemself ) within naturalistic sentences, and the model must choose the correct pronoun set from a candidate list. This setup probes reverse inference and bias, especially for uncommon or mismatched name-—pronoun combinations. As shown in the table 7, GPT-40 and Claude-4- Sonnet exhibit near-perfect accuracy across all name—pronoun groupings. GPT- 4o achieves 100% accuracy for both match and mismatch sets, confirming its robust context-to-pronoun generalisation. Claude-4-Sonnet follows closely with 95.6% on mismatch and 99.0% on match sets. Qwen2.5-72B performs well over- all, attaining 81.2% on mismatched combinations and 98.1% on matched ones. However, the smaller Qwen-Turbo model struggles with mismatches, highlight- ing its susceptibility to name-pronoun co-occurrence bias. DeepSeek-V3 achieves relatively strong mismatch generalisation and excellent performance on matched cases, yet still lags behind GPT-4o on rare pronoun inference. In the breakdown by name, gender, and class, most models perform best when given unisex names (e.g., Alex, Taylor) and matched pronoun forms. For example, Qwen2.5-72B and DeepSeek-V3 show over 99% accuracy for unisex name-pronoun matches, but performance degrades on mismatched gendered pairs (e.g., male name with feminine pronouns), revealing residual bias in name-to-gender priors. Overall, re- sults indicate that modern LLMs can correctly back-infer pronoun declarations with high accuracy in controlled prompts, though biases persist for less-aligned or nontraditional associations. This validates name-prediction as a useful diag- nostic for identity inference and model bias detection. 6 Discussion 6.1 Result Analysis The results from Experiments 1 through 3 reveal clear stratification in model capabilities across pronoun resolution, grammatical consistency, and gender iden- tity inference. Across all three tasks, GPT-40 and Claude-4-Sonnet consistently demonstrate superior performance, while open-source models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen variants lag behind, especially in zero-shot conditions. Few-shot prompting as a performance equalizer. Few-shot prompting dramatically improves model performance, particularly for those with weaker baseline abilities. As for DeepSeek-V3 jumps from 21.0% on he to 77.9%, and similar leaps occur across other neopronouns. This suggests that while some models may lack robust zero-shot generalization, they retain latent syntactic capabilities that can be activated with minimal context. For models like GPT-4o and Claude-4, the improvements are less dramatic but still notable, reinforcing their robustness across diverse input styles.

Both models originate from organizations primarily focused on the multilingual market, and it’s plausible that English data constitutes a smaller portion of their pretraining corpora. Moreover, less investment in English-centric alignment and inclusive language modeling may result in limited exposure to nonbinary pronoun usage or syntactic nuance, hampering generalization in these tasks. This hypothesis is supported by the stark contrast between their zero-shot and few- shot performance, suggesting a capability that exists but remains unactivated without explicit contextual cues. Comparative Trends with the MISGENDERED Study. The earlier study evaluated models such as ChatGPT (March 2023), Alpaca, and Flan-T5 on the orgininal benchmark. Several notable trends emerge when comparing the 2023 and 2025 evaluations. First, the overall accuracy of LLMs on neopronouns has significantly improved. In 2023, even the best-performing model (ChatGPT) struggled with less common forms like ze/xem, ze/zir, and thon, achieving only around 75% accuracy under zero-shot settings. By contrast, our 2025 evaluations show that GPT-4o and Claude-4-Sonnet exceed 95% accuracy on nearly all neo- pronouns, with several exceeding 99% under few-shot prompting.This reflects stronger internalization of inclusive linguistic forms and better alignment with gender-diverse usage. Second, grammatical consistency has also improved. Re- An Updated Evaluation on Nonbinary Pronoun Handling in LLMs 15 flexive and possessive-dependent forms posed persistent challenges, with lower accuracy across all tested models. Our results show that modern LLMs have narrowed these gaps. For instance, GPT-4o achieves 98.7% accuracy on reflexive forms and over 95% on possessive-dependent forms in the few-shot setting, out- performing past models by a large margin. This indicates modern LLMs have become significantly better at handling the structure and rules of how words change and relate to each other in a sentence, especially for pronouns with differ- ent grammatical forms. While earlier models struggled to handle rare pronouns and mismatched contexts, today’s top-performing models exhibit near-human performance, provided minimal contextual guidance. This underscores the im- pact of larger model sizes, improved training datasets, and instruction tuning in bridging representational fairness gaps in LLMs. 6.2 Future Directions Remaining Gaps. Despite considerable advancements over prior work, in- cluding improved zero-shot accuracy and higher consistency across binary and gender-neutral pronouns, several critical gaps persist: — Incomplete Generalization Across Pronoun Types: Leading models such as GPT- 4o and Claude 4 demonstrate strong performance on commonly used pronouns. However, they still falter on less frequent neopronouns like xe/xem, ze/hir, and novel invented forms. These gaps reflect the underrepresentation of such forms in pretraining data and the limitations of tokenization-based learning, particularly for rare or fragmented tokens. — Name-Based Gender Heuristics Persist: In the reverse name-to-pronoun pre- diction task, several models defaulted to binary pronouns based on stereotypical gender associations of names, even when such predictions contradicted explicitly declared or implied pronoun usage. This suggests that implicit social priors still override context-aware reasoning in many LLMs. — Ethical Incompleteness in Benchmark Design: Although the original MISGEN- DERED benchmark was a major step forward, its structure did not require explicit consent. Our MISGENDERED-+ variant improves this by mandating pronoun declarations and including name—pronoun mismatches, but gaps in cov- erage (e.g., intersectional identities, multilingual settings) remain. Key Challenges. Building on the identified gaps, we outline three fundamental challenges facing the development of gender-inclusive LLMs: — Inclusive Data Scarcity: Collecting sufficiently diverse, high-quality, and context- rich training data that includes inclusive pronoun usage, especially neopronouns and nonbinary identity expressions, remains a significant challenge. These forms are often underrepresented in mainstream corpora, leading to gaps in represen- tation and limiting LLMs’ exposure. — Evaluation Ambiguity: Measuring pronoun fidelity and inclusivity in LLMs is inherently complex due to the lack of standardized metrics, context-sensitive 16 X. Tang et al. interpretations, and overlapping grammatical and social cues. This makes it challenging to reliably assess whether a model’s output is both syntactically correct and socially respectful, especially in edge cases involving neopronouns or ambiguous identity contexts. Future Work. To advance the responsible development of inclusive language models, we propose several research directions: — Augmented Training with Inclusive Corpora: Future LLMs should be finetuned or adapted using corpora enriched with gender-diverse, non-binary, and neopronoun- inclusive narratives. Such data augmentation can mitigate exposure bias and improve generalization to underrepresented forms. — Probabilistic Pronoun Modeling: Inspired by Bayesian and non-parametric frame- works, integrating dynamic pronoun preferences as learned distributions may support better personalization and context adaptation. Models could be designed to condition on user-declared identities with formal uncertainty representations. — Community-Centered Evaluation and Co-Design: Inclusive benchmarks should be built in collaboration with queer, trans, and non-binary communities. Crowd- sourcing and participatory design can help ensure that metrics reflect lived expe- rience and that systems are not only technically accurate but socially respectful. 7 Related Work Fairness Surveys in LLMs. Recent comprehensive surveys [12] systematically categorise bias evaluation methods across multiple demographic dimensions, in- cluding race, gender, religion, and socio-economic status. They highlight that many evaluation strategies still inadequately address the spectrum of pronoun diversity, especially where non-binary and neopronouns are concerned. This sur- vey distinguishes between intrinsic fairness, bias inherent in model representa- tions, and extrinsic fairness, manifested in downstream tasks. They argue that even with debiasing interventions, underrepresented identities continue to suf- fer disproportionately in open-ended generations and reasoning contexts. Simi- larly, another study [8] provides a three-tier taxonomy (embeddings, probabil- ities, text-generation) to evaluate bias and notes that most existing datasets fail to adequately reflect gender diversity and pronoun usage. In addition, the work [18] expands on these frameworks, offering a broader overview of bias types and mitigation strategies across model scales, yet still lack targeted coverage of pronoun robustness. Further study [7] introduces a multi-turn conversational fairness benchmark, demonstrating how biases can accumulate across dialogue, notably when pronouns are used, and yet it omits fine-grained pronoun diversity evaluation. Demographically Diverse Benchmarks. The work [22] introduced the Parity Benchmark, which systematically evaluates LLMs across demographic attributes such as gender, race, age, and ability. It employs controlled, balanced prompts to assess model parity in responses; however, their benchmark design omits explicit An Updated Evaluation on Nonbinary Pronoun Handling in LLMs 17 attention to pronoun diversity, especially non-binary and neopronouns. Futhere- more, the CCSV-based diversity benchmarks [11] were proposed, analyzing how LLMs self-critique and self-vote to improve demographic representation in gen- erated lists (e.g. names or entities). While this benchmark explicitly measures people diversity, it still does not examine whether models correctly adapt pro- noun forms in discourse contexts. A study [19] complement this perspective with DiversityMedQA, focusing on medical question answering across patient gender and ethnicity. Their findings reveal significant performance disparities, under- scoring that even domain-specific benchmarks must account for demographic variation. Yet, similar to other studies, pronoun usage is treated only indirectly through gender perturbations. Moreover, existing surveys and theoretical anal- yses [5,13] highlight that benchmark effectiveness is contingent on capturing data attributes like diversity, difficulty, and linguistic nuance. Pronoun diver- sity remains a major blind spot in this context, even though benchmarks like SoFa [14] begin to explore nuanced identity expressions. Overall, while these benchmark efforts significantly improve our understanding of LLM fairness and representation, they commonly omit fine-grained assessments of pronoun varia- tion, particularly non-binary and neopronouns. 8 Conclusion In this paper, we presented MISGENDERED-, an enhanced benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on their ability to handle inclusive pronoun usage. Building upon the original MISGENDERED framework, we in- troduced new task designs and evaluated five recent LLMs, including both com- mercial (GPT-40, Claude-4-Sonnet) and open-source (Qwen2.5, Qwen-Turbo, DeepSeek-V3) models. Our results show that while modern aligned models have significantly improved in handling gender-neutral and neopronouns, challenges persist, particularly for open-source systems and in gender identity inference tasks where name-based bias can mislead predictions. The benchmark reveals key insights into how current LLMs process identity cues, highlights persistent gaps in fairness under conditions of syntactic ambiguity and pronoun complexity, and provides essential groundwork for further research into bias detection, inclu- sive language generation, and the development of more equitable, accountable, and socially responsible LLM systems worldwide.

2508.00751v1 [cs.IR] 1 Aug 2025 arX1Vv Harnessing the Power of Interleaving and Counterfactual Evaluation for Airbnb Search Ranking Qing Zhang Alex Deng* Michelle Du Airbnb Microsoft Airbnb San Francisco, CA, USA Seattle, WA, USA San Francisco, CA, USA [EMAIL] [EMAIL] [EMAIL] Huiji Gao Liwei He Sanjeev Katariya Airbnb Airbnb Airbnb San Francisco, CA, USA [EMAIL] ABSTRACT Evaluation plays a crucial role in the development of ranking algo- rithms on search and recommender systems. It enables online plat- forms to create user-friendly features that drive commercial success in a steady and effective manner. The online environment is partic- ularly conducive to applying causal inference techniques, such as randomized controlled experiments (known as A/B test), which are often more challenging to implement in fields like medicine and public policy. However, businesses face unique challenges when it comes to effective A/B test. Specifically, achieving sufficient statis- tical power for conversion-based metrics can be time-consuming, especially for significant purchases like booking accommodations. While offline evaluations are quicker and more cost-effective, they often lack accuracy and are inadequate for selecting candidates for A/B test. To address these challenges, we developed interleaving and counterfactual evaluation methods to facilitate rapid online assessments for identifying the most promising candidates for A/B tests. Our approach not only increased the sensitivity of experi- ments by a factor of up to 100 (depending on the approach and metrics) compared to traditional A/B testing but also streamlined the experimental process. The practical insights gained from usage in production can also benefit organizations with similar interests.

By presenting users with different variations, we can measure the impact of changes based on user actions directly. A/B testing is a widely used method for this purpose. In a typical A/B testing scenario, visitors to a website are randomly assigned to either a control group or a treatment group. The control group is exposed to the baseline version of the website, which usually reflects the current live production environment, while the treatment group experiences the versions produced by the new, proposed algorithm. The effectiveness of the treatment is evaluated by comparing key business metrics, such as conversion rates, between the two groups. Additionally, a comprehensive set of debugging metrics, including funnel conversion rates, user engagement levels, and characteris- tics of the results, are analyzed to gain deeper insights into the behavior and performance of the ranking algorithms. A/B testing has become a cornerstone for fostering continuous innovations, playing a crucial role in their ability to adapt and improve [21]. A significant volume of work has been dedicated to enhancing the effectiveness of A/B testing. Notably, [7] proposed leveraging pre-experiment data to reduce metric variance and improve sensi- tivity. This approach has been widely adopted across the industry, as seen in works such as [22, 33]. Additionally, in-experiment data has been utilized to develop surrogate metrics that aim to achieve high sensitivity and provide early readings on business metrics, which often experience delayed outcomes [5]. The extensive use of A/B testing in the industry has led to the accumulation of valuable practical lessons, which have been studied in depth [8, 19, 20]. A/B testing alone, however, is often insufficient due to the long running times required for experiments on e-commerce platforms like Airbnb. There are three main reasons. First, users typically visit the site with a certain level of intent to make a purchase. Since Airbnb users generally travel only twice a year, the traffic KDD ’25, August 3-7, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada for experiments is significantly lower compared to search engines. Second, while conversion is usually the target metric, it takes time to realize. The higher the stakes, the longer the search journey; for instance, an Airbnb user might spend several days searching for accommodation that fits their preferences. In contrast, search engines receive immediate feedback from user clicks. Third, as the system matures, the effect size of each innovation tends to be small, which necessitates an even longer time to detect statistically significant changes [1]. A logical question arises: why don’t we use offline evaluations to identify the most promising candidates for A/B testing? Indeed, offline evaluation is often employed as a preliminary step for model assessment. This process involves collecting search logs, which in- clude the results displayed and the corresponding user actions, and using them to evaluate the proposed ranker. While this approach is efficient and risk-free, it tends to lack accuracy. The primary reason is that the ranker we aim to evaluate only has the visibility of what has been shown by the logging ranker but not all the candidate items. To address this selection bias, techniques such as inverse propensity weighting (IPW) [26], based on importance sampling [13], have been proposed. However, these techniques often result in high variance, as noted by [10]. In addition, obtaining the propen- sity score (the probability of a result being displayed) is complicated due to system complexity [4]. In addition, offline metrics are frequently disconnected from online business metrics. For example, the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) [15] is a standard offline metric, while conversion rate serves as the primary online metric. Often, these two metrics are inconsistent. Furthermore, offline evaluations can- not fully account for the user dynamics that occur when individuals interact with ranked lists. To bridge the gap between the two approaches, we seek a mid- dle step that is faster than A/B testing while being more accurate than offline evaluation. Interleaving experiments, first proposed in [16, 17], offer a potential solution. However, several open questions remain. Firstly, the interleaving methods developed in prior work primarily used clicks as user feedback, whereas our target metric is conversion, which is much sparser, as previously noted. Addi- tionally, we must consider scalability, as the method will be imple- mented in production and handle real traffic; thus, both complexity and latency need to remain within acceptable limits. Consequently, it is unclear whether the state-of-the-art interleaving mechanisms can be efficiently and effectively applied to ranking problems in e-commerce platforms like Airbnb. In this paper, we share our recent advances in enhancing the ex- perimentation velocity for Airbnb’s search ranking. We present our innovations in interleaving experiment design and the engineer- ing framework. Following this, we detail an online counterfactual evaluation approach that is more generalizable and addresses the limitations of interleaving. Both techniques are utilized for select- ing treatment candidates for A/B testing. These systems are used by engineers working on search ranking at Airbnb, and the validation of these techniques is based entirely on real-world usage, as op- posed to the dataset-based simulations commonly used in previous work. Our contributions are, Qing Zhang et al. e Competitive pair based interleaving that’s unbiased and highly efficient, and we observed 50X speedup improvement compared to A/B in production. The speedup is computed with traffic needed to achieve similar statistical power as A/B test. e Online counterfactual evaluation which further improved the sensitivity on top of interleaving and more generalizable. The metrics demonstrated up to 100X speedup compared to A/B. e Practical lessons from the usage in production that provides full picture of of the techniques. e Both interleaving and counterfactual evaluation approaches presented in the paper can be fairly easily generalized to other platforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work where both ap- proaches have been implemented in production, evaluated side by side and used on a daily basis. The paper provides a comprehensive comparison, detailing both the advancements and limitations of each approach and an experimentation strategy with interleaving, counterfactual evaluation, and A/B test to improve overall exper- imentation velocity in practice, which will prove invaluable for businesses facing similar challenges. 2 PRELIMINARIES 2.1 Problem Definition First, we define the notations and formulate the evaluation prob- lem. We use z to denote the ranking algorithm (also referred to as the policy). Given a set of candidate listings with features X (which include listing attributes, past engagements, queries, and user history), the algorithm generates a ranked list represented as L ~ x(L|X). After presenting this list to the user, we observe the reward O ~ p(O|X,L), which can include events such as clicks and purchases. O can be an empty list when there is no user action for the L. The value of the policy z is defined as the expected reward V(a) = E(f(O) « 2(O|X)), where f maps rewards into numeric value. Given a proposed policy ; and a baseline policy 0, the evaluation problem involves designing an estimator for V(z) and using the difference tr = V(2,) — V(0) to assess the impact of policy 2; compared to policy 2. The intuition of comparison can be further developed with poten- tial outcome framework [14]. Formally, let W be the assignments, and each element wj; indicates the group that subject i belongs to, specifically control when w; = 0 and treatment when w; = 1. Also, let Y denote the outcome (reward), where Y;(0) represents the outcome when control is applied to instance i, and similarly Y;(1) treatment. For a moment, let’s assume we can observe outcomes from both groups then we can compute the impact Y;(1) — Y;(0) on each element, and get average treatment effect N r= = YH) ~ ¥(0) = FA) ~ FO) (1) i=1 Therefore V(t) = Y(w) here. In common settings we cannot observe both Y;(0) and Y;(1) at the same time. For example a user is either exposed to the treatment or control policy, but not both. Thanks to the randomized controlled experiment, such as A/B test, Harnessing the Power of Interleaving and Counterfactual Evaluation for Airbnb Search Ranking the difference between the observed outcome 7 is unbiased for t [14], @ = pes — Yes (2) where superscript obs indicates that these are observed outcomes. ¥OP5 = S-Di =o VPS, and similarly ¥?8 = Ke Diwan VP%S. Interleaving and counterfactual evaluation, on the other hand, connects with the original form Eq 1 by examining the Y;(1) — Y;(0). We will have more discussion in later sections. Percent delta relative to baseline is computed as following, MA = £/YO%S (3) In rest of the paper we omit the step of Eq 3 when discussing metrics for simplicity and assume it is always the final step. 2.2 Design Principles When examining and designing the online evaluation techniques, we are guided by the following principles that were proposed and refined in previous work [1, 12, 17, 24], e Sensitivity. A primary objective of an evaluation approach is to achieve the desired statistical power with the minimal amount of data necessary. e Unbiasness. When a user randomly interact with ranked result, we should expect there is no preference according to the estimator. Fidelity. The estimator should align with the intuition when user operate on the original results. e Minimal user experience disruption. The user experience during the evaluation should mirror the experience that they would typically have when using the product under normal conditions. Acceptable complexity and scalability. The system is going to be integrated into a large-scale user-facing search framework, necessitating efficiency in both operation and maintenance. Generalizability. Given the dynamic nature of the search system and evolving business requirements, the evaluation methodology must be flexible and easily extendable. It is expected that an evaluation approach may perform well in some criteria while underperforming in others. Therefore, trade-offs have to be made based on the specific use case. 3 > RELATED WORK 3.1 Interleaving Experiments Interleaving is an online testing methodology first proposed in [16, 17]. The central idea is to provide the same user with two variants that we want to compare (e.g., results from two rankers) and to infer their preferences based on the user actions, which indicate the quality difference between the two. The key components of this methodology include a merging algorithm to blend the two result lists and a credit assignment mechanism. The technique enables the assessment of ranker relevance through user events, such as clicks, without adding any overhead for the user. Moreover, it allows for a direct comparison of two rankers by the same user. This development is significant, as it marked a shift away from the traditional reliance on human annotators for Web search evaluation. KDD 25, August 3-7, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada There are primarily three types of interleaving methods. The first type, Balanced Interleaving (BI), was introduced in [16, 17]. This method ensures that the top k results in the merged result list I consistently include the top kg results from ranker A and ky results from ranker B, with kg and k, differing by no more than one [3]. As a result, the merged list evenly distributes impressions between the two rankers. For credit assignment, each click within I is attributed to both A and B, provided it appears in their respective lists and is above a certain position threshold. The ranker accumulating more clicks is deemed superior. However, as [3] points out, balanced interleaving can yield biased results when the two rank lists are almost identical, differing only by a slight shift or insertion. To address this bias, [1] developed an interleaving method that debiases BI by incorporating IPW for credit attribution. The process requires, for each ranker, computing the probability of receiving a click at each position in the merged list. Despite its effectiveness, the BI+IPW method poses complexities in credit attribution and less extensible compared to our approach. The second type of interleaving method is Team Drafting Inter- leaving (TD), as introduced in [25]. This method utilizes a merging algorithm that mimics the process of drafting in sports teams. It iterates through both ranked lists from top to bottom, selecting the highest-ranked available item to add to the combined list I. Each item in J is assigned to a "team," indicating its origin from either ranker. Preferences are determined by counting which "team" has gathered more clicks. This approach addresses the bias issue identified with BI. [3] suggested several refined schemes for credit assignment. Our work builds upon TD, offering more efficient credit computation and increased generalizability. [12] pointed out that TD potentially violates fidelity in certain cases, our practical ex- perience in production has not revealed any issue stemming from these cases. Moreover, our research into counterfactual evaluation indicates that such scenarios have a negligible effect on the overall evaluation. We will explore this topic in greater detail in Section 5.4. The third type of interleaving method, Probabilistic Interleaving (PI), was introduced in [11, 12] with the aim of improving upon BI and TD. Unlike BI and TD, where the merged list I is constructed from a fixed order of items from A and B, PI uses softmax functions s(A) and s(B) to transform these lists into probability distributions over documents, from which items are then sampled to create list I. The credit computation in PI considers all possible sequences of drafting that could result in the formation of list J. While PI is unbiased in its approach, it has the potential to significantly alter the user experience and introduces greater system complexity for production use. 3.2 Interleaving in Practice There is limited literature on how interleaving is used in production. Most of the previous work are research projects ran on limited datasets, such as [11, 12]. There were experiments conducted in Microsoft and Yahoo!, such as [3] but consistency with A/B test were not discussed. The study most relevant to our work is [1] by Amazon, which uses BI as base algorithm and applied IPW to correct the bias, as mentioned earlier. It was evaluated by comparing the results with 10 A/B tests. Our approach is more efficient and we report our comparison with A/B with much larger corpus. KDD ’25, August 3-7, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada 3.3. Counterfactual Evaluation When evaluating policy z, data collected from another policy 9 is often used. It is usually in the form of past search logs, leading to the terms “off-policy" and "offline evaluation" being used interchange- ably. Three categories of work have emerged in this field. The first category involves directly modeling (DM) the reward and using it to predict the outcome of the target policy for each search. This approach typically results in a low variance but high bias estimator [18]. The second category is the model-free approach. As mentioned in Section 1, Inverse Propensity Weighting (IPW) method is pro- posed to correct the probability of events observed in historical data. For instance, if an item has a probability 2 of being shown ac- cording to the target policy, the outcome is weighted by a where mo represents the probability of being shown according to the log- ging policy [13, 26]. While IPW is unbiased, it suffers from high variance. A series of techniques have been developed to address the challenges in IPW based approaches, including Clipped Inverse Propensity Score [29] and Self-Normalized IPS estimator [30]. In the third category, the Doubly Robust Estimator [9] combines the DM and IPW estimators. This approach is both unbiased and consistent while exhibiting lower variance than IPS. Furthermore, several variations have been developed based on the doubly robust estimator [23, 27, 28, 32]. The aforementioned work primarily focuses on multi-arm bandit evaluation, which cannot be directly applied to search ranking due to the large action space. However, in the online counterfactual evaluation discussed in this paper, we incorporate elements of IPW and reward estimation. Recent development has used counterfactual result to decom- pose the target metric and reduce the variance [6]. Specifically counterfactual results are utilized to categorize the events into high and low signal-to-noise ratio portions and it enables the weighting between the two portions. Our work is built on top of the approach. 4 INTERLEAVING WITH COMPETITIVE PAIR As outlined in Section 1, our existing experimentation process com- prises two steps. Initially, experimenters utilize offline evaluation with historical data during the early stages of iteration. This ap- proach is fast and cost-effective, requiring only 1-2 hours for Airbnb cases, though it lacks accuracy. Subsequently, the promising can- didates identified in the first step proceed to A/B testing, which is constrained by limited bandwidth and requires weeks to com- plete. This bottleneck could be alleviated by introducing a middle stage that that is much faster than A/B and more accurate than offline evaluation. Interleaving, known for its high sensitivity [3], emerges as a viable option for the stage. We tackle the online eval- uation challenges 1) low frequency transaction and 2) conversion as target metric by efficient team draft design and innovative credit attribution. 4.1 Methodology In Section 3.1, we examined three variations of interleaving: BI, TD, and PI. The complexity of these methods, particularly in terms of their merging algorithms and credit attribution processes, can be ordered from most to least complex as PI > BI > TD. Given that Qing Zhang et al. our system is intended to operate in a production environment and cater to all search ranking experimentations, we chose TD for its efficiency and extensibility. 4.1.1. Competitive Pair and Credit Attribution. In the previous work [25], the team drafting process involves teams taking turns to select the next item not yet included in the merged list I. A coin flip at each turn determines which team picks first. We design team drafting with a notion of competitive pair and the coin flip only happens once at the beginning procedure. In every turn, we draft the next available item from each team. If different, they form a competitive pair, and are added I with the order determined by the coin flip. The team assignment is logged accordingly. If the items are identical, the item is added to I without being assigned to any team. This procedure is detailed in Algorithm 1. The design is highly efficient for serving and preference calculation. To illustrate, let’s walk through an example with two ranked lists C = {a, b,c, d, e} and T = {b,c, a, f,g}, assuming isC first = true. The first few steps of team drafting process would unfold as follows: e Draft a from C and b from T. As the two items are differ- ent, they form a competitive pair and are placed in I, as [a°, b" | (line 7 - 9). The super script indicates the team as- signment. e The next available items are c from C and c from T. Since they are the same, c is added to IJ without a team assignment. (line 13 - 14) e This process continues until the end condition is met. Following this procedure, the output would be I = {a°, b" , c, d©, fT}. Our design guarantees that each team has an equal opportunity to be selected first, ensuring that rankers C and T have identical chances of displaying their listings in any given position. The ap- proach effectively eliminates position bias in our measurements. To maintain a consistent user experience, we construct list I with a length equal to the minimum of [, and 1;, the lengths of the lists generated by rankers C and T, respectively. In our production envi- ronment, /, and J; are equal except in rare cases, as it is from the same user search request. 4.1.2 Preference. Team preference is determined by counting the victories of each competitive pair and then aggregating these re- sults to the desired level of analysis. In our case, we consider the individual user as the unit of analysis (although search requests could also serve this purpose). For each user i, the outcome is iden- tified based on which team—C or T—has more wins. We define Y;(w) = wins(w), where w can either be team C or team T and the function wins(.) simply counts the number of wins for the corre- sponding team. The preference measure, 7;, is then calculated as the difference in wins between team T and team C, expressed as tj = Y\(T) — Yj(C). This method provides a clear and quantifiable metric for team preference at the user level. Tpref = S(t > 0) - Do tc < 0)) (4) The p-value is computed by proportional test on }); 1(7; > 0) and )); 1(7; < 0), which are the number of subjects who prefers T and C respectively. Harnessing the Power of Interleaving and Counterfactual Evaluation for Airbnb Search Ranking Algorithm 1: Competitive Pair Team Drafting Input: ranked list C and T, coin filp result isC first Output: Interleaved list I Ie, ly <— len(C), len(T) ly — min(Ic, lt) ke, kt <— 0,0 4Il¢O 5 while ko! = —1&k! = —1&ke < [c¢&k < 1p&len(1) < 1; do ray N w 6 if A[ke]! = B[k;] then 7 if isCfirst then 8 T—1UC[ke]© 9 | Te IUT[k;|! 10 else u IC IUT [ky]? 2 | Te 1UClke]© 13 else 14 | P=1u Clke] 15 ke <— nextAvailable(C, ke, 1) 16 | kt <— nextAvailable(T, kt, I) 17 return J Using competitive pairs allows for a direct comparison between two items from the two rankers, with each pair acting as the basis for attributing credit. This approach minimizes noise in determining preferences, especially when the event is sparse, such as conversion. It has demonstrated high sensitivity in our validation process. 4.1.3 Unbiasness. If users interact with I by clicking randomly, there is no team preference based on the credit attribution scheme. To illustrate it, we use competitive pairs as the base unit to derive the user preference. A user who take actions randomly will click first and second item in the pair with probability P(C = 1|r = 1) and P(C = 1|r = 2), where r is rank of the listing and C = 1 if clicked, and 0 otherwise. The expectation of the listing from A (or B) get clicked is P(C = 1|r = 1)P(r = 1)+P(C = 1|r = 2)P(r = 2). As each ranker has the equal chance of being ranked at the first according to team draft algorithm, so we have P(r = 1) = P(r = 2) = 0.5. By aggregating all pairs, we will get that ranker A and B will have an equal number of expected wins. Careful readers may question the unbiasness when only the first item from the last competitive pair is returned, given our control over result length by l; in Algorithm 1. Since each team has an equal chance of having this lone item, no bias is introduced, as confirmed by the data quality checks detailed in the following section and Section 6.2.3. 4.1.4 Data Quality Monitoring. In addition to assessing the busi- ness impact of the treatment ranker, our credit assignment algo- rithm serves an important role in data quality checks, which are essential for accurate experimentation. Specifically, the algorithm can be applied to evaluate the distribution of impressions and the frequency with which each team appears first in a competitive pair. We anticipate neutral outcomes since each team should receive an equal number of impressions, and there should be a 50% chance for either team to appear first in the competitive pair. The methodology KDD 25, August 3-7, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada enables us to verify the unbiased nature of each experiment. Should these quality metrics fail to meet our expectations, the results of the experiment would be deemed invalid, indicating that the team drafting algorithm did not perform as expected. To our knowledge, this approach has not been previously proposed. 4.2 Architecture Design In order to support the interleaving, we designed two-layer exper- iment delivery scheme. The first layer divides the traffic, which are users in our case, into regular A/B test and interleaving. The users assigned to A/B portion will be exposed to A/B tests as usual. For whose who are assigned to the interleaving portion, the sec- ond layer maps them to the corresponding interleaving experiment (Figure 1). Within the interleaving framework, each experiment slot is referred to as a “lane,” highlighting the fact that all necessary traffic for interleaving is contained within this slot, unlike in the A/B setup, which requires a control arm in addition.

The first layer decides which user is subject to interleaving and the second assigns the user to the specific interleaving experiment. search system receives a query from a user assigned to interleaving, a parallel call component initiates control and treatment search requests simultaneously. These requests proceed through the entire search stack, producing individual search responses. Subsequently, the team drafting algorithm is employed to merge these responses into a final result list, which is then presented to the user. 4.3 Interleaving in Production The interleaving system has been integrated into Airbnb’s search ranking experiment process and has been utilized to conduct over a hundred experiments. Due to its high sensitivity, interleaving is conducted with a small fraction of traffic and over a much shorter duration than A/B testing. The computational complexity, including latency, is well within the threshold required by the search system. 5 COUNTERFACTUAL EVALUATION While interleaving is recognized for its high sensitivity, there are specific scenarios where its application is limited. First, when a ranker extensively uses set level optimization, such as improving diversity of the results, the interleaving would break the assumption. Second, when search list is also used for generating other results on the website, such as map view at Airbnb, there is risk to disrupt user experience. Lastly, it is not straightforward to implement semanti- cally meaningful metric for continuous value based outcome such as revenue. A promising approach to overcome these limitations while preserving the benefits of search-level pairwise comparison is to avoid result blending altogether. This can be achieved by creating counterfactual results within the A/B testing paradigm, thereby KDD ’25, August 3-7, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada maintaining the same user experience as outside of evaluation while still allowing for effective comparison and evaluation. Next, let’s delve deeper into the rationale behind the approach. As previously mentioned, in an A/B test, participants are divided into two groups. For those who are in control group, they will always see results from control ranker, and similarly treatment group user will see the treatment ranker results. Then we compare the conversion rate of treatment vs control group. Interleaving takes a nuanced approach to this comparison. For each search query, it generates results from both the control and treatment rankers, merges these results, and then displays the combined list to the user. Counterfactual evaluation serves as a hybrid of A/B testing and interleaving. It leverages the concept of generating paired results for each search, similar to interleaving, yet evaluates these results using metrics computed in a manner akin to A/B testing. The relationship between the three types of evaluations are illustrated in Figure 2. AJB Test Cc T Cc T & = Interleaving Counterfactual Evaluation » ° » cl Cc T C=control, T=treatment, CF=counterfactual T as CF Cas CF Figure 2: Counterfactual evaluation intuition. It can be un- derstood as combining the characteristics of A/B tests and interleaving. It uses the results from both ranker for metrics computation, but doesn’t need to blend them together. In counterfactual evaluation, there is notion of shown and coun- terfactual results. For each search, we generate results L, and L; based on both control and treatment ranker. If L- shown to the user, then L; is the counterfactual result, and the roles reverse if L; is shown instead. For the ease of description, we use w denote the shown ranker and 1 — w as counterfactual. For each user who are subject to the experiment, we flip a coin to decide which result to show. The randomization is seeded by user ID and experiment ID. Such design ensures the consistent user experience and minimize the carryover effect when running back to back experiments. We present online counterfactual evaluation below, which is a direct extension of interleaving. It leverages parallel calls similar to interleaving to obtain the results from both control and treatment. Subsequently we utilize the counterfactual results to analyze the shown results, as opposite to interleaving which blends these two sets of results. This approach allows us to derive metrics that are more sensitive than those typically used in A/B testing. In [6], direct decomposition on target metrics based on counterfactual result is proposed. With it as foundation, we present a novel approach that’s based on relative position and estimated outcome in the counterfactual, which is proved to be more sensitive. 5.1 Direct Decomposition Based Estimators First we describe the Direct Decomposition approach [6]. Let Y(w) denote the outcome of each group, where w is the assignments, and Qing Zhang et al. its value 0 and 1 represent control and treatment respectively. For any given item associated with an event (for example, a booking), its ranking position is denoted as rj(w) when subjected to the treatment w. We can categorize the outcome into two types, YS?" (w) = 1(ri(w) <= k&rj(1- w) <=k : &lri(w) — ri(1 — w)| <= @) ° veTF w) = 1(|ri(w) - 711 — w)| > @) (6) Where k and @ are hyperparameters encoding the mapping of ranking difference and true conversion impact. We simply use the values that’s discussed in [6], which are k = 4 and @ = 2. The direct decomposition based estimator is, Tdecomp = ‘dif f + 0 * Tsim (7) Tgif f ANd Tsim are the average treatment effect aggregated on user level by following Equation 1. As detailed in [6], tyi¢¢ has much smaller variance than Tsjm, and significant variance reduction can be achieved from the re-weighting. We use 8 = 0.2 in production. 5.2 Estimated Reward Based Estimators The direct decomposition method categorizes target metrics based on the ranked positions generated by both the shown and counter- factual rankers. This approach utilizes estimators that are depen- dent on both the absolute and the relative positions of the item in question. Building on this, we introduce a novel type of estimators that focuses solely on the difference in positions. Define f : Z* — Rasa booking probability model. For a search i that has booking event, let Y;(w) = 1, then Y¥;(1 — w) = f(ri(1 - w))/f(ri(w)), and the gain between shown and counterfactual is Yi(w) — ¥(1- w) = 1- fri — w))/f(ri(w)) (8) In our implementation, we chose to use exponential function for f, with y as decay factor, f(r) = y~”. It is based on the observation that the lower the listing is ranked, the less likely that the user is going to interact with it. We also incorporate the notion of similar ranking proposed in direct decomposition, specifically when |rj(w) —ri(1-w)| <= a we consider the item is ranked at similar position between the shown and counterfactual. Formally, we compute the gain as gi = 1 — yx (aw) — 1 w) |= 220) (9) Based on win/lose status, we have a pair of estimators ° r"(w), loss (w) = gi, 0, if ri(1 — w) — ri(w) — a > 0 (If shown ranker w ranks better, it gets g; as the gain at winning position) er" (w), loss (w) = 0,g;, if ri(w) — ri. — w) — a > 0 (If counterfactual ranker 1 — w ranks better, shown ranker gets gi as the gain at losing position) When |rj(w) — rj(1 — w)| is within @, item rankings are deemed similar, so g = 0 accordingly. Regarding y, a smaller value corre- sponds to a faster decay of attention curve and results in larger incremental gain. The estimator doesn’t use the absolute position, but simply the difference. We count difference of overall wins as Harnessing the Power of Interleaving and Counterfactual Evaluation for Airbnb Search Ranking gain estimator, 1 . . Tg = wo U(r)" (w = 1) > 0) * 7)""(w = 1) -»} 1(r}""" (w =0) >0)* 7" (w =0)) We also designed win-loss estimator, which is to count for each treatment, the difference of the event that’s in winning position (10) and losing position. Twin-loss = sen (w = 1) _ 7!088 (wy = 1))- ee (11) Soren w =0)- 7f°88 (Ww =0))) We aggregate the metrics across the users. 5.3. OEC (Overall Evaluation Criteria) Metric We use a combination of direct decomposition and estimated re- ward based metrics to form the OEC metric (main metric) with the purpose of combining the potential benefit of both estimators. Specifically, we define Toec = B1 * Tdecomp + fo * Tq (12) We currently simply assign equal weights, with (1 = f2 = 0.5. 5.4 Connection with Interleaving In [12], TD interleaving was pointed out to lack fidelity as well as sensitivity when there is a shift or insertion between two lists. For example, with C = {a,b,c,d} and T = {b,c,d,a}, then I = {a°, b' c,d} (C first), or I = {b?,a°,c,d} (T first). If the user booked listing c, we do not infer any preference as it is assigned to neither team. However, if we look at the original list, T is the better ranker because it ranks c higher than C. As we’ve seen in coun- terfactual evaluation discussed earlier, shift-by-one is considered no gain when we set equal zone threshold a > 0. In the validation Section 6.3.2, we show that a = 2 works better than even a = 1 (we did not collect data for a = 0), which supports the conclusion from interleaving that C and T is a tie if the booked item is c. The findings of counterfactual evaluation deepened our under- standing of the relationship between fidelity and sensitivity in interleaving. The fidelity violation actually doesn’t impact TD’s sensitivity. 5.5 Event Attribution Until now, our discussion of the event has been somewhat abstract. In this section, we aim to clarify how event is attributed. The click event serves as the most straightforward example, establishing a direct link between the search result and the user’s action of clicking. However, our primary interest lies in conversion; therefore, booking is the key event we focus on. The search journey of an Airbnb user often spans multiple sessions, meaning a listing that gets booked can appear in more than one searches. Insights from previous research on Airbnb’s ranking system [31] suggest that a user’s decision to book a listing is influenced by every instance the listing appears during their search journey, not merely the final one. Consequently, for both interleaving and counterfactual evaluation, we attribute the booking event to all occurrences where KDD 25, August 3-7, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada the listing was presented to the user during the experiment period, acknowledging the compound effect of repeated exposure on the booking decision. 6 VALIDATION AND ANALYSIS For both interleaving and counterfactual evaluations, we gather corresponding A/B test results, when available, to serve as ground truth for validation. Note that often times what eventually tested in A/B is different from interleaving/counterfactual evaluation, as the experimenter would do final adjustments based on the evaluation results. We only picked the cases with no or minor adjustment for validation. Our aim is to achieve readings that are not only consistent with A/B test results but also demonstrate higher sensitivity. To assess the consistency between the proposed evaluation methods and A/B test outcomes, we focus on the correlation coefficient between point estimates from both evaluation approaches. To this end, we compile a validation corpus comprising two lists of point estimates: one from our proposed evaluation method, denoted as M£, and the other from A/B test results, denoted as M4/8_ For each ranker i, there exists a corresponding point estimate in both lists, obtained from the proposed evaluation method and the A/B test, respec- tively. The correlation coefficient between these two sets of point estimates is calculated using standard methods [2], providing a quantitative measure of the consistency between our proposed evaluation techniques and traditional A/B testing, _ Cou(ME, M4/8) OyEO MA/B corr (13) Where Cov(ME, MA/B)y is the covariance between M® and M4/8. Oye and oy,a/e are variance within each result list. 6.1 Baselines In our study, we conducted a comparison of our methodologies against the two most relevant contemporary approaches in the field. Firstly, for the interleaving method, we benchmarked our speed improvements against the findings reported by [1]. Like us, [1] evaluated their interleaving approach in the context of its performance relative to traditional A/B testing. Secondly, for the counterfactual evaluation method, we compared our approach to [6], because the work in is also aimed at search ranking evaluation, making it a directly comparable study to our own. Through these comparisons, we aim to highlight the advancements our approaches bring to the field. 6.2 Interleaving 6.2.1 Consistency with A/B. We collected 29 interleaving - A/B test pairs, and the point estimates of interleaving and A/B test on our target conversion metric is plotted in Figure 3. Overall interleaving and A/B are directionally aligned 82% of the time. The correlation coefficient is 0.6. Through the usage, interleaving proved to be highly sensitive, as we observed about 50X speedup from A/B. We had a test ranker whose logic was to pick a random listing in the result list and put it to the top. The A/B test took weeks to conclude and the interleaving can detect the negative conversion impact using one KDD ’25, August 3-7, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada A/B Test Interleaving Figure 3: Interleaving and A/B Test point estimates. Axis ticks are omitted. day’s data on a fraction of traffic. The BI based interleaving from [1] reported 60X speedup based on a corpus size of 10. We consider the results are comparable and our approach is much more efficient computationally. 6.2.2 Case Study. We are particularly interested in the inconsistent pairs. Our cases suggested a limitation of interleaving when the set level optimization is involved. For example, there was a treatment ranker that optimizes another objective other than conversion. The aim was to remain neutral in terms of conversion while improving the secondary objective. Initially, listings were sorted according to their booking probability. The ranker then rearranged some of these listings to better align with the secondary objective. When users were directly presented with this re-ranked list, they were likely to book listings based on the estimated trade-off between the primary and secondary objectives. However, the scenario changed when we interleaved these treatment results with control results. Users tended to select listings with a higher booking probability from the control group as they looked more attractive when placed side by side with treatment listings in competitive pair, leading to the treatment ranker’s underperformance. This discrepancy was evident as we observed a significant negative impact in the inter- leaving results, whereas the conversion remained neutral in the A/B test. 6.2.3. Unbiasness Validation. As discussed in Section 4.1.4, thanks to the extensibility of competitive pair based TD, we are able to compute data quality metrics in the same way as conversion. They provide the validation on unbiasness for each interleaving experi- ment and Table 1 demonstrates the results from a past experiment. We expect no preference between two teams, which is confirmed by the metrics. Table 1: Unbiasness validation Metric A pval listings shown 0.00% 0.91 shown first -0.01% 0.85 shown reciprocal rank -0.02% 0.85 listings found 0.00% 0.95 6.3 Counterfactual Evaluation Similar to Interleaving, we collected 30 online counterfactual ex- periments whose treatments were later tested in A/B to evaluate the consistency and study the effect of hyperparameters. Qing Zhang et al. 6.3.1 Consistency with A/B. The main metric Tec point estimate, which is plotted in Figure 4, has correlation coefficient 0.65 with A/B. Therefore overall the consistency matches the interleaving. A/B Test Counterfactual Evaluation Figure 4: Online counterfactual evaluation and A/B point estimates. Axis ticks are omitted. We show individual metrics point estimate correlation with A/B tests in Table 2. tg performs the best. ty; ¢¢ is much higher correla- tion than Tsim, which is consistent with findings in [6]. Tyin—Joss is between the tg and tgif f. Table 2: Metrics point estimate correlations with A/B test Metric Corr with A/B Tg 0.66 Twin—loss 0.58 Tdif f 0.55 Tsim -0.29 We studied the experiments in which the counterfactual evalua- tion didn’t work well and they are mainly due to shared real time user signals. For each search, as shown and counterfactual results are derived from the same user, the user related features are identi- cal for ranker C and T. When two rankers have drastically different capability of utilizing such features, the stronger one would utilize the engagement earned by the weaker ranker and gain an unfair advantage. Therefore we may want to discount the trustworthiness when the control and treatment ranker pair falls into such case. 6.3.2 Effect of Hyperparameters. In reward based approach dis- cussed in Section 5.2, there are two hyperparmeters. The first one is the position decay factor y, quantifying how fast user’s atten- tion decrease along with the ranked position. We compared the t, and A/B correlation in respect to y, and the results are similar. For y = 0.9 and y = 0.95, the correlation coefficients are 0.644 and 0.648 respectively. The second hyperparameter we examine is ranked position sim- ilarity threshold a, and our observations, as detailed in Table 3, indicate that setting a = 2 yields better correlations. This finding suggests that minor differences in relative position do not effec- tively differentiate ranking quality, regardless of the listing’s overall rank. Table 3: Metric variations correlation with A/B (y = 0.9) Metric a=1 a=2 Tq 0.64 0.66 T 0.58 0.60 win-loss Harnessing the Power of Interleaving and Counterfactual Evaluation for Airbnb Search Ranking 6.3.3 Sensitivity. We observed significant speed up compared to A/B. To achieve our target minimal detectable effect, the counterfac- tual evaluation requires much less traffic. We observed around 15X speed up for Toec, 23X for Twin—Joss- The most significant speed up is from tg, whose speedup is around 100X. The findings support our hypothesis that by adding additional knowledge from the coun- terfactual result of the same search, we can measure the impact with much less traffic. 6.4 Interactions and Carryover Effects The risk of interaction between different evaluations is minimized through our experiment delivery strategy, which is outlined in Sec- tion 4.2. The majority of search traffic is allocated to A/B testing, while the remainder is designated for interleaving or counterfactual evaluation methods. Within this smaller segment, we further divide the traffic into distinct lanes, with each experiment being assigned its own lane. This structured approach ensures that each evaluation method operates within its own controlled environment, signifi- cantly reducing the potential for cross-experiment interference. The carryover effect refers to the influence of a previous experi- ment on the current one when they run back-to-back. Our approach minimizes this effect through randomization design. Let us consider an assignment group Gj, where i € {C, T} represents the control or treatment groups from the previous experiment, and let u denote a user. In the case of interleaving, the carryover effect would occur if Vu € Gj, the condition isC first is consistently true or false. How- ever, this is avoided because randomization occurs at the search level - each search flips a coin to decide which ranker goes first in team drafting. It was further validated through experiments that the carryover effect wasn’t observed. For counterfactual evaluation, we employ randomization based on user ID and experiment ID. The latter ensures that the assign- ment for the current experiment is independent of the assignment for the previous experiment. Additionally, we have analyzed back- to-back experiments and found no evidence of carryover effects. 7 DISCUSSIONS 7.1 Implementation Choice Interleaving and counterfactual evaluation presents a promising direction of evaluation in ranking. The central idea is to have the visibility of the ranked lists from both ranker 7; and zo. For inter- leaving, the two lists are combined and shown to the user, so the speedup comes from the comparison in each competitive pair. The counterfactual evaluation does not interfere with what is going to be shown to the user, and simply uses the counterfactual results to create more sensitive reward estimators. Interleaving and counterfactual evaluation metrics exhibit simi- lar prediction power to the A/B tests, so generally speaking they both are well-suited for pre-A/B test online evaluations. Interleav- ing, with straightforward credit computation, has shown higher sensitivity compared to a subset of counterfactual evaluation met- rics, which is a clear advantage. On the other hand, counterfactual evaluation demonstrates greater robustness for rankers with strong set level optimization. In use cases like we discussed in the Section 6.2 about re-ranking for optimizing secondary objective in Airbnb search, counterfactual KDD 25, August 3-7, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada evaluation would not suffer from the bias according to later experi- ments of similar nature, as user will always see the full results from control or treatment. Therefore the choice of the technology is depending on the use cases, as well as the experiment bandwidth availability. 7.2 Generalization Both interleaving and counterfactual evaluation presented in the paper can be fairly easily applied to other businesses. They can be well applied to the scenarios when traffic (users) and the user action event are abundant, such as engagement-targeted (e.g. click through rate) optimization on search and recommendation. They would, in particular, show strength when traffic and/or events are limited, for instance, e-commerce platforms where the conversion is the target metric. Traditional A/B testing in such an environment demands prolonged periods, ranging from weeks to months, to gather sufficient data for reliable statistical power. Conversely, the methods we present require significantly less traffic and a shorter duration to yield meaningful results. We provide further guidelines on the implementation in the Appendix A. 8 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK The paper presented our innovation in speed up Airbnb search ranking experimentation. Our version of interleaving is efficient and highly sensitive, and we extended it to develop online counter- factual evaluation which addresses the limitations of interleaving and more generalizable. Both approaches are proved to be effective online evaluation technique for treatment candidate selection for A/B test based on the large scaled usage at Airbnb. The techniques can be easily adopted by other online platforms. Since implementation of these systems, we conducted hundreds of experiments for which we observed an increase in capacity to test new ideas and generally higher success rates in A/B testing. Furthermore, we leverage this framework for conducting model studies, including ablation tests and initial explorations for new projects. For future directions, we aim to improve the accuracy of pre- dicting outcomes from counterfactual results by incorporating data collected during the experiment itself. In our current approach in estimated reward based estimator, we rely on assumptions about outcomes associated with the counterfactual ranker. However, a more precise prediction model can be developed once data from the ongoing experiment, or on-policy data, is accessible. By analyzing user feedback from this data, we can refine our predictions, thereby enhancing the overall sensitivity of our evaluation method.

A IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES FOR ADOPTION We would like to provide suggestions on two areas that are key to adaption, which are event attribution and hyperparameter tuning. A.1_ User Event attribution When applying our methods, practitioners need to carefully design the logic that attributes events, such as bookings, to the appearance of items, like listings shown in search or recommendation feeds. In cases where the booked listing appears in multiple search results, deciding on an attribution window becomes necessary. Options include attributing the booking to the appearance in the last search, to searches within the last two days, or to all searches within the experiment period. The choice could be based on the analysis on user decision making process. A.2 Counterfactual evaluation hyperparameters The selection of hyperparameters, specifically the attention de- cay factor y and the similarity threshold a, is contingent upon the product’s interface. For instance, a horizontal layout typical of rec- ommendation systems may necessitate different parameter values compared to a vertical layout, which is common for search results. These parameters are crucial for accurately modeling user behavior and must be tailored to the specific characteristics of the product. Concretely, a possible procedure of tuning the parameters is as follows. e Initial value yo will be determined by curve fitting on the click or booking distribution across ranked positions, then we pick candidate values centered around yo. Subsequently we will mainly use meta-analysis to compare the metrics correlations that’s corresponding to each value with A/B tests. e a value will be determined by meta-analysis on values such as {0, 1, 2, 3}.

This label noise severely impairs feature alignment and degrades adaptation performance under domain shifts. To address this challenge, we propose Nested Graph Pseudo- Label Refinement (NeGPR), a novel framework tailored for graph-level domain adaptation with noisy labels. NeGPR first pretrains dual branches, i.e., semantic and topology branches, by enforcing neighborhood consistency in the feature space, thereby reducing the influence of noisy supervision. To bridge domain gaps, NeGPR employs a nested refinement mech- anism in which one branch selects high-confidence target samples to guide the adaptation of the other, enabling pro- gressive cross-domain learning. Furthermore, since pseudo- labels may still contain noise and the pre-trained branches are already overfitted to the noisy labels in the source do- main, NeGPR incorporates a noise-aware regularization strat- egy. This regularization is theoretically proven to mitigate the adverse effects of pseudo-label noise, even under the pres- ence of source overfitting, thus enhancing the robustness of the adaptation process. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeGPR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under severe label noise, achieving gains of up to 12.7% in accuracy. Introduction Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) (You et al. 2022; Cai et al. 2024) has emerged as a prominent technique for leverag- ing labeled graph data from a source domain to enhance learning on an unlabeled target graph domain. Its efficacy has been demonstrated across diverse applications, includ- ing temporally-evolved social network analysis (Wang et al. 2021, 2024c; Yao et al. 2023), molecular property predic- tion (Zhu et al. 2023; Yin et al. 2024c), and protein-protein interaction modeling (Cho, Berger, and Peng 2016; Wang et al. 2024a). The core paradigm typically involves learning domain-invariant node/graph representations that bridge the distributional shift between source and target domains, thus enabling effective inference on the target data. dreamkily @ gmail.com, [EMAIL], suyu.liu @ntu.edu.sg However, the success of standard GDA methods crucially relies on the accurately labeled source data. In practice, source domain labels are often corrupted by noise arising from annotation errors (Dai, Aggarwal, and Wang 2021; Yuan et al. 2023b), subjective judgments (Platanios, Dubey, and Mitchell 2016; Yin et al. 2024d), or inherent ambigu- ities in data collection (Chen, Shah, and Kyrillidis 2020; Wang et al. 2024b). This prevalent issue of label noise can severely misguide the learning of domain-invariant repre- sentations (Li, Socher, and Hoi 2020; Yin et al. 2024b), leading to suboptimal or even detrimental adaptation per- formance on the target domain (Yin et al. 2025; Wang et al. 2025). Existing noise label learning methods typically rely on loss function design to mitigate the impact of noisy la- bels (Han et al. 2018; Natarajan et al. 2013), which se- lects clean instances for joint training, and robust loss func- tions (Wei et al. 2020; Li, Socher, and Hoi 2020), which leverage small-loss selection or instance mixture models. While effective in controlled settings, these approaches fall short in the presence of domain shifts. The coexistence of distribution shift and label noise leads to misaligned fea- ture spaces, causing noise-robust losses to erroneously align clean features with noisy targets, thereby amplifying neg- ative transfer (Yu et al. 2020; Yin et al. 2022a). While re- cent efforts have been made to address GDA under noisy labels (Yuan et al. 2023a; Wang and Yang 2022), they pri- marily target node classification tasks, leaving a critical gap in addressing graph-level scenarios. Many real-world ap- plications, such as molecular property prediction (Stokes et al. 2020) and social network analysis (Hamilton, Ying, and Leskovec 2017), inherently depend on graph-level clas- sification, where label noise can severely compromise the identification of functional groups and the modeling of com- munity behaviors. The lack of attention to graph-level adap- tation under noisy labels significantly limits the practical ap- plicability of existing methods in high-impact domains. In this paper, we investigate the development of an effi- cient GDA framework for scenarios involving label noise. However, designing such a framework poses several funda- mental challenges: (1) Distribution shift undermines loss- based denoising. Conventional noise-robust loss functions are primarily designed for specific domains and often strug- gle under distribution shifts. In the presence of noisy la- bels in the source domain, aligning target features with cor- rupted source representations can lead to noise-aligned em- beddings, degrading generalization due to feature misalign- ment and increased risk of negative transfer. Recent stud- ies in GDA have highlighted that noisy supervision severely hinders feature alignment across domains, especially when relying on pseudo labels or unreliable source signals (Yuan et al. 2023a). These findings underscore the need for noise- aware mechanisms that explicitly account for both label noise and domain discrepancy. (2) Imperfect pseudo labels compromise domain adaptation. Probability-based pseudo- labeling has shown promise in bridging distribution shift and mitigating supervision noise (Yuan et al. 2023a; Yin et al. 2023a). However, the reliability of selected pseudo labels is often compromised by erroneous source annotations, lead- ing to residual noise being transferred into the target do- main. In Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), such corrupted pseudo labels can propagate through message passing, trig- gering self-reinforcing error cascades. As each GNN layer aggregates information from potentially mislabeled neigh- bors, the accumulated noise progressively deteriorates local neighborhood structures and distorts global representations over successive adaptation rounds (Wang et al. 2024d). (3) Label noise impairs distribution alignment in GDA. Exist- ing methods typically adopt explicit (Long et al. 2015) or implicit (Long et al. 2018) strategies to align feature dis- tributions across domains. However, significant label noise corrupts supervision signals, causing samples to drift to- ward incorrect class regions and disrupting the formation of domain-invariant features. This misalignment undermines the effectiveness of domain discriminators and hampers re- liable adaptation. These challenges call for a unified frame- work that combines noise-robust representation learning, trustworthy pseudo-label refinement, and alignment strate- gies that preserve class-level semantics across domains. To tackle these challenges, we propose Nested Graph Pseudo-Label Refinement (NeGPR), a novel framework de- signed for GDA under noisy labels. To effectively disentan- gle the impact of label noise from domain distribution shift, NeGPR first pre-trains noise-resilient models from implicit and explicit perspectives by enforcing semantic consistency among neighboring samples in the feature space. The im- plicit branch promotes feature-level consistency based on learned representations, while the explicit branch captures structural patterns by leveraging graph topology. This dual- perspective design improves robustness to noisy supervision and provides a reliable foundation for domain adaptation. Then, to align the domain distribution, NeGPR iteratively leverages cross-branch knowledge, where one branch filters highly reliable target domain samples, and the other branch is fine-tuned accordingly, enabling mutual enhancement and progressive adaptation. However, the filtered pseudo-labels may still contain erroneous category information, and the pre-trained branches have already overfitted to the label noise in the source domain. The interplay of these two fac- tors exacerbates performance degradation during domain adaptation. To tackle this, NeGPR employs a regulariza- tion along with a theoretical analysis demonstrating its ef- fectiveness in suppressing the influence of noisy pseudo- labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NeGPR sig- nificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods under severe label noise. Our main contributions are summarized as: e We investigate a novel problem setting, graph domain adaptation learning under label noise, where label noise and domain shift coexist and jointly pose significant chal- lenges for graph representation learning. We propose NeGPR, a dual-branch framework that in- tegrates noise-resilient pre-training, nested pseudo-label refinement, and theoretically grounded regularization to tackle graph domain adaptation under label noise. We evaluate NeGPR on extensive datasets, showing that NeGPR significantly outperforms existing approaches under various noise levels and domain shift scenarios. Related work Graph Domain Adaptation. Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) has emerged as a critical research topic, aiming to leverage labeled source domain graphs to enable robust rep- resentation learning on unlabeled or sparsely labeled target graphs (Lin et al. 2023; Luo et al. 2023; Liu et al. 2024a). To achieve this, most existing approaches first employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) (Kipf and Welling 2017a; Chen et al. 2023) to generate representations for each graph (Wu, Pan, and Zhu 2022; Zhu et al. 2021; Yin et al. 2022b). They then commonly use adversarial learning to implicitly align feature distributions and reduce domain discrepancies, apply pseudo-labeling to iteratively refine predictions in the target domain, or incorporate structure-aware strategies to explic- itly align graph-level semantics and topological structures, thereby improving generalization across diverse graph do- mains (Yin et al. 2023b; Wang et al. 2024b; Liu et al. 2024b). However, these methods often overlook the impact of noisy labels, which can distort learned representations and lead to misaligned distributions and unreliable predictions in the target domain. Although a few label-denoising GDA meth- ods have been proposed, they primarily focus on node-level tasks (Yuan et al. 2023a). To address these limitations, we propose a novel label-denoising domain adaptation method designed for graph-level classification tasks. Learning with Noise Labels. Learning with noisy labels has garnered significant attention for its crucial role in de- veloping robust models under imperfect supervision, which has been widely used in machine learning and computer vi- sion (Zhu et al. 2024). Existing methods typically address label noise by employing robust loss functions, identifying and filtering out noisy samples, or refining labels through correction mechanisms (Feng et al. 2021; Xu et al. 2025). However, existing methods still insufficiently investigate the interplay between label noise and domain adaptation (Yin et al. 2024a; Zhu et al. 2024). In particular, applying a model trained on the source domain to the target domain can be regarded as a noisy inference process due to distributional shifts inherent in domain adaptation (Yu et al. 2020; Dan et al. 2024). Furthermore, label noise in the source domain can also degrade model performance (Yuan et al. 2023a; Yu et al. 2024). Critically, conventional methods cannot disen- tangle whether the observed performance degradation is pri- marily attributable to domain shift or label noise, thereby Implicit Extraction Branch 3 S| 8 N & : Qa Explicit Extraction Branch Top-k(G;) Target Graph Data Noisy Pseudo-Label Explicit Tolerated Regularization > Tang > Extraction |—> | Lrerine Branch me Noisy zB Direction iS} "3 Nested Pseudo-Label Refinement Correct Direction = - Tolerated Implicit Regularization Extraction |—> Lye rine Branch & => 72, Figure 1: Overview of the proposed NeGPR. NeGPR consists of a dual-branch pretraining module that captures complementary semantic and structural features under label noise. Then, a nested pseudo-label refinement module alternately selects high- confidence target samples from one branch to guide the other, enabling progressive cross-domain adaptation. The noisy pseudo- label tolerated regularizatio penalizes overconfident predictions to suppress the effect of noisy pseudo labels. limiting their ability to address the underlying causes of adaptation failure effectively. To address this challenge, we propose a novel learning framework designed to mitigate the effects of domain shift and label noise. Methodology Overview of Framework This work studies the problem of unsupervised graph do- main adaptation in the presence of noisy labels and proposes a novel framework, NeGPR, as illustrated in Fig. 1. NeGPR comprises three key components: (1) Noise-Resilient Dual Branches Pre-Training. To effectively suppress the im- pact of label noise, we first pre-train noise-resilient mod- els from implicit and explicit perspectives by enforcing semantic consistency among neighboring samples in the feature space; (2) Nested Pseudo-Label Refinement. To align category-level distributions, each branch selects high- confidence pseudo-labeled target samples based on predic- tion confidence and uses them to fine-tune the other branch. This cross-branch refinement mitigates error accumulation from noisy pseudo labels and enables progressive domain adaptation through mutual supervision; (3) Noisy Pseudo- Label Tolerated Regularization. To alleviate the negative impact of noisy pseudo labels, we introduce a noise-aware regularization term with theoretical guarantees. This regu- larization effectively suppresses error propagation induced by noisy pseudo labels during the adaptation process. Problem Formulation Given a graph G = (V,€, X) with the set of nodes V and edges € C V x V. The X € R'”!*4 is the node feature ma- trix, where each row x, € R® denotes the feature of node v € V, |V| is the number of nodes, and d denotes the di- mension of node features. In our setting, we have access to a labeled source domain D* = {(G3, y?)})'8, with n, sam- ples, where the labels y? may be corrupted by noise, and an unlabeled target domain D' = {GU }"", with n, sam- ples. Both domains share the label space VY = {1,2,--- ,C} but follow different data distributions. The goal is to train the graph classification model using both D* and Dé and achieve high accuracy on the target domain. Noise-Resilient Dual Branches Pre-Training To mitigate the adverse impact of noisy labels in the source domain, we adopt a dual-branch architecture that captures semantic consistency from implicit and explicit perspec- tives. Noisy supervision can distort the feature space by pulling semantically similar graphs toward incorrect class boundaries. In contrast, the local relationships among neigh- boring samples often remain reliable despite label corrup- tion. Motivated by this, we construct two parallel branches that exploit neighborhood consistency to learn robust repre- sentations. One branch captures semantic similarity through learned features, while the other incorporates structural in- formation derived from graph topology. This design en- hances the model’s resilience to noise and provides a stable foundation for subsequent domain adaptation. Implicit Extraction Branch. The implicit branch follows the MPNNs mechanism (Gilmer et al. 2017), which extracts graph semantics by aggregating neighborhood representa- tions to update the central node embeddings. Specifically, we update the embedding of node wu at layer / and then sum- marize the node embeddings into graph-level: hi, =COM (ni, AGG (BSven)) 2? =RBADOUT ({ht}.,-y). where (wu) is the neighbours of node u. COM and AGG denote the combination and aggregation operations, READOUT is the graph pooling function. This formulation allows the implicit branch to capture structural information indirectly through supervised learning with noisy labels. Explicit Extraction Branch. While the implicit branch cap- tures structural semantics indirectly, its performance may deteriorate under domain shifts due to limited sensitivity to distributional changes. To enhance structural awareness, we introduce a complementary branch that explicitly encodes topological information by extracting high-order subgraph patterns (Shervashidze et al. 2011; Nikolentzos, Siglidis, and Vazirgiannis 2021). This design enables the model to gener- ate graph-level representations that are more robust to struc- tural discrepancies across domains. Specifically, we formu- late the explicit extraction branch as: h, = (Sv (G)), Wey, 223 — READOUT ({hy},cy) where S,(G) denotes a set of high-order substructures ex- tracted from G (e.g., shortest paths (Borgwardt and Kriegel 2005) or subtree patterns (Shervashidze et al. 2011)), @(-) encodes each substructure into a latent representation, and READOUT(-) aggregates these representations into a graph-level embedding. The resulting Zé? serves as the ex- plicit topological representation of the graph. Noise-Resilient Pre-Training. To mitigate the impact of la- bel noise in the source domain, we exploit local seman- tic consistency among graphs in the feature space. Empir- ically, semantically similar graphs tend to exhibit stable fea- ture distributions, even under corrupted labels (Wang and Isola 2020; Iscen et al. 2022). Based on this insight, we con- struct a semantic neighbor graph by identifying the top-k nearest neighbors for each source sample using similarity aj = 2B 2B /\|28. (2G, ll over graph-level embed- dings obtained from each branch, where B € {IB, EB}. To enforce prediction consistency within local neighbor- hoods, we encourage the predicted distribution to align with a weighted average of its semantic neighbors’ predictions: S B aij: ZG; 5 j€etop—k(G;) 1 B _ B Le. = S KL | 2, Ns « 1 4 where KL is the Kullback-Leibler divergence, top—k(G;) is the top-k nearest neighbors samples of G;. This regulariza- tion guides the model to learn noise-resilient representations by aligning each prediction with its semantic context, rather than relying solely on potentially corrupted labels. In formu- lation, we pre-train the dual branches with: Lite = Leap + BL vise: (1) sup where LE, = x i (o(2G, ), yi) is the supervised clas- sification loss, / is the cross-entropy loss and a is the softmax function. B € {IB,EB} indicates the implicit and explicit branches pre-training. Nested Pseudo-Label Refinement While various domain adaptation techniques such as distri- bution alignment (Long et al. 2015; Ganin et al. 2016) and adversarial training (Tzeng et al. 2017; Pei et al. 2018) have been widely explored, they often rely on strong assumptions regarding the existence of domain-invariant representations, which may not hold in the presence of label noise. In con- trast, pseudo-labeling provides a flexible and data-driven al- ternative by leveraging model predictions on unlabeled tar- get samples to guide adaptation (Lee et al. 2013; Xie et al. 2020). In our setting, the dual-branch encoder offers two complementary perspectives for estimating target seman- tics, enabling more reliable pseudo-label selection through confidence-based filtering. This design facilitates progres- sive adaptation by gradually incorporating trustworthy tar- get samples into training, while retaining the robustness of the noise-resilient pre-trained branches. Specifically, at each iteration of cross-branch pseudo- label refinement, we select one branch to generate pre- dictions for all target domain samples. For each sample Gi € D*, we compute the predicted class probability vector yj = Softmax(z@, ), where B € {IB, EB}. We then select a set of high-confidence samples Jeong defined as: The = {Ge D* | max(y;) > ¢}, (2) where ¢ is a pre-defined threshold. The corresponding pseudo-labels are assigned as: yj = arg max(y;), VG) € TG; The selected pseudo-labeled samples {(G%,, j;)}, are then used to fine-tune the other branch with: , , 1 ~ / Line = Lhe ~~ \72 | S> Yj log o(2G ), (3) conf cterB conf where o(zB,) denotes the predicted probability from the other branch B’ and o is the Softmax operation. The two branches are alternated in subsequent iterations, allowing the model to progressively adapt through mutual supervision. Noisy Pseudo-Label Tolerated Regularization Pseudo-labeling facilitates adaptation to the target domain by providing surrogate supervision, yet it inevitably in- troduces label noise that may compromise model perfor- mance (Rizve et al. 2021). To address this issue, we propose a noise-aware regularization term that penalizes overconfi- dent or unstable predictions during refinement. This regular- ization serves as a soft constraint to suppress the influence of unreliable pseudo-labels, guiding the model toward more consistent and robust predictions. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis, which guarantees its ability to mitigate the negative impact of noisy supervision and enhance gen- eralization in the target domain. Specifically, we define the refinement loss with the noisy tolerated regularization as: Y> tos ((o(@8:), (28))) . conf , _ B’ Xv LRe =Lrefine — \72 conf! Gg where (o(22, ),o(z2,)) denotes the inner product between J Jd the softmax predictions of the two branches. Here, o repre- . / sents the Softmax function, and zee ; Zi are the graph-level J Jd embeddings of Gi produced by branches B’ and B, respec- tively. B, B’ € {IB, EB} with B 4 B’. For future analysis of the effectiveness of noisy-tolerant regularization, we de- rive the gradient of Eq. (4) and introduce Lemma 1. Lemma 1 Let 0 denote the parameters of branch B’.

This reduction weakens the learning signal from clean samples and allows noisy examples to dominate the opti- mization. The regularization term g; alleviates this issue by maintaining substantial gradient contributions for clean in- stances, thus preserving their supervisory effect even as the loss converges. When 4; is incorrect, the cross-entropy term Pp; — y; becomes positive, leading to updates that push the model away from the true class. The regularization term g;, which is typically negative at the true class index, counter- acts this effect by reducing the gradient magnitude on mis- labeled examples. This dampening mechanism limits the in- fluence of noisy labels during optimization. Learning Framework The overall learning framework is outlined in Algorithm 1, which adopts an alternating dual-branch strategy to pro- gressively refine pseudo labels and suppress the influence of label noise. The process begins with noise-resilient pre- training on the source domain to initialize both the implicit and explicit branches (lines 1-3). At each iteration, one branch generates pseudo labels for the target domain, and high-confidence samples are selected based on prediction probability (lines 6 and 8). These samples are then used to update the other branch via a regularized training objective (lines 7 and 9). The two branches alternate roles throughout training (lines 5-10), enabling mutual correction and pro- moting robust adaptation under noisy supervision. Experiments Experimental Settings Datasets. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed NeGPR, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets from TUDataset, covering diverse types of domain shifts. For structure-based domain shifts, we uti- lize MUTAGENICITY (Kazius, McGuire, and Bursi 2005), NCI1 (Wale, Watson, and Karypis 2008), FRANKEN- STEIN (Orsini, Frasconi, and De Raedt 2015), and PRO- TEINS (Dobson and Doig 2003), where each dataset is par- titioned into source and target domains based on variations in edge, node and graph flux density to simulate structural distribution shifts (Yin et al. 2023b). For feature-based do- main shifts, we evaluate NeGPR on PROTEINS, DD, BZR, BZR_MD, COX2, and COX2_MD (Sutherland, O’ brien, and Weaver 2003), where domain discrepancies primarily arise from differences in semantic feature distributions. Detailed dataset statistics are provided in Appendix C. Baselines. We compare the proposed NeGPR with a com- prehensive set of competitive baselines on the datasets above. These baselines include two graph kernel methods: WL (Shervashidze et al. 2011) and PathNN (Michel et al. 2023); four general graph neural networks: GCN (Kipf and Welling 2017b), GIN (Xu et al. 2018), GAT (Veli¢kovié et al. 2018), and GMT (Baek, Kang, and Hwang 2021); five label denoising methods: Co-teaching (Han et al. 2018), RTGNN (Qian et al. 2023), Taylor-CE (Feng et al. 2021), OMG (Yin et al. 2023c), and SPORT (Yin et al. 2024a); six graph domain adaptation methods: DEAL (Yin et al. 2022b), CoCo (Yin et al. 2023b), SGDA (Qiao et al. 2023), A2GNN (Liu et al. 2024a), StruRW (Liu et al. 2023), and PA-BOTH (Liu et al. 2024b); and two methods that address both label noise and domain adaptation: ALEX (Yuan et al. 2023a) and ROAD (Feng et al. 2023). More detailed descrip- tions of the baseline settings are provided in Appendix D. Implementation Details. We implement NeGPR and all baseline models using PyTorch and conduct all experiments on NVIDIA A100 GPUs to ensure a fair comparison. For NeGPR, the implicit branch (IB) is instantiated with the GMT (Baek, Kang, and Hwang 2021) architecture to cap- ture semantic consistency via message passing, while the ex- plicit branch (EB) employs the PathNN model (Michel et al. 2023) to extract high-order topological structures explicitly. Both branches use 4 GNN layers, with a hidden dimension of 256 and a weight decay of 10~!*. The models are trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1074. All the models are trained on noisy labeled source graphs and evaluated on unlabeled target graphs. We set the noise ratio a = 0.3 and the pseudo-label threshold ¢ = 0.9 by default.

From these tables, we observe that: (1) Label denoising methods con- sistently outperform general graph-based approaches, as the presence of noisy labels significantly impairs the perfor- mance of standard graph models lacking dedicated noise- handling mechanisms. (2) Graph domain adaptation meth- ods generally outperform graph-based and label-denoising approaches by effectively mitigating domain distribution shifts. However, their performance may still degrade when source labels are corrupted, highlighting the need for meth- ods that jointly address domain shift and label noise specific for graphs. (3) Label denoising domain adaptation meth- ods demonstrate superior performance over graph domain adaptation methods, which highlights the importance of ex- plicitly addressing label noise alongside domain alignment to enhance model generalization in noisy cross-domain set- tings. (4) The proposed NeGPR consistently achieves the highest performance across datasets in most cases, demon- strating its superiority. The outstanding performance is at- tributed primarily to two factors: (i) the integration of im- plicit branch and explicit branch enables comprehensive ex- traction of both structural and semantic features, substan- tially enhancing representation quality and classification ac- curacy; and (ii) the nested refinement and noisy tolerated regularization modules jointly promote robust cross-domain adaptation by progressively selecting reliable supervision and suppressing noisy signals. Additional results on other datasets are provided in Appendix E. Ablation Study We conduct ablation studies to examine the contributions of each component in the proposed NeGPR: (1) NeGPR w/o IB: It removes the implicit extraction branch; (2) NeGPR w/o EB: It removes the explicit extraction branch; (3) NeGPR w/o NRL: It removes the noise resilient loss in the pretraining stage; (4) NeGPR w/o NTR: It remove the noisy pseudo-label tolerated regularization loss during fine-tuning. Experimental results are reported in Table 3, 5-7. From the results, we find that: (1) NeGPR outperforms NeGPR w/o IB and NeGPR w/o EB, underscoring the importance of integrating implicit and explicit branches that capture semantic and structural information.

(2) NeGPR w/o NRL demonstrates inferior performance compared to NeGPR. The NRL effectively reduces the negative impact of noisy labels in the source domain by promoting local consistency among neighboring nodes. This constraint en- ables NeGPR to learn noise-resistant representations suit- able for domain adaptation. (3) NeGPR outperforms NeGPR w/o NTR, demonstrating that the noise tolerant regulariza- tion effectively mitigates the impact of noisy pseudo-labels by preserving reliable supervision from clean samples. This constraint prevents overfitting and enhances the model’s ro- bustness and generalization across domains. Additional re- sults on other datasets are provided in Appendix E. Sensitivity Analysis We perform a sensitivity analysis to examine how the key hyperparameters of NeGPR, namely the pseudo-label con- fidence threshold ¢ and the noise ratio a, affect its per- formance. Specifically, ¢ governs the selection of high- confidence pseudo-labeled target samples, while a deter- mines the proportion of corrupted labels in the source do- main. Both parameters play a critical role in balancing su- pervision quality and model robustness. Figure 2 illustrates how ¢ and a affect the perfor- mance of NeGPR on the PROTEINS dataset. We vary ¢ within the range of {0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9} and a@ in {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4,0.5}. From the results, we observe that: (1) The performance of NeGPR in Figure 2(a) steadily in- creases as threshold ¢ rises. A higher threshold can effec- tively filter out pseudo-labels with lower confidence, which reduces the risk of propagating incorrect information during model training, enabling the model to learn from more reli- able supervision signals. Thus, we set the threshold ¢ to 0.9 as default to ensure optimal pseudo-label reliability.

A higher noise ratio introduces more incorrectly labeled samples into the source domain, thereby degrading the reliability of supervisory signals during train- ing. Consequently, this prevents the model from accurately learning discriminative representations. To maintain a bal- ance between realistic data conditions and robust perfor- mance, we set the noise ratio a to 0.3 by default. More re- sults on other datasets are shown in Appendix E. Flexible Architecture To assess the impact of different backbone choices for the IB and EB branches, we evaluate various message passing methods in IB, including GCN (Kipf and Welling 2017a), GAT (Velicékovié et al. 2018), GIN (Xu et al. 2019), and GMT (Baek, Kang, and Hwang 2021), and adopt several graph kernel-based methods in EB, such as Graph Sam- pling (Leskovec and Faloutsos 2006), Random Walk (Kalo- folias, Welke, and Vreeken 2021), WL (Shervashidze et al. 2011), and PathNN (Michel et al. 2023). As shown in Fig- ure 3, and consistently observed across other datasets, GMT and PathNN yield the best performance in most cases. This can be attributed to their superior representation capacity, which provides a solid foundation for capturing both seman- tic and topological features of graphs. These results further validate our choice of GMT in IB and PathNN in EB, as they offer complementary strengths that enhance the effec- tiveness of dual-branch modeling. Their strong performance also highlights the importance of backbone selection in en- suring stable adaptation under noisy supervision. Conclusion This paper introduces NeGPR, a noise-aware dual-branch framework for robust GDA under label noise. To tackle noisy supervision and distributional shifts, NeGPR em- ploys a dual-branch pretraining strategy: one branch cap- tures semantic consistency via local message passing, while the other encodes structural features using a graph kernel method, enabling the extraction of complementary graph representations. A nested pseudo-label refinement mecha- nism progressively aligns source and target domains by al- ternately using high-confidence predictions from one branch to supervise the other, enhancing cross-branch consistency and mitigating domain gaps. Additionally, a noise-aware regularization term penalizes overconfident or inconsistent predictions, reducing the impact of noisy labels. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and noise settings vali- date the superior robustness and generalization of NeGPR, underscoring its promise for reliable graph transfer learning.

Complexity Analysis The overall time complexity of the proposed NeGPR framework is determined by two main stages: noise-resilient pre-training and nested pseudo-label refinement. In the pre-training phase, the Implicit Branch (IB) incurs a complexity of O(L - ({V| + |E|) - d,), while the Explicit Branch (EB) has a complexity of O(|V| - ({V| + |E|)) for shortest-path computation, along with an additional O(n? - d,) for semantic neighbor search, where d, is the embedding dimension and L represents the number of GNN layers. During the refinement stage, the forward pass over n; target graphs incurs a cost of O(n; - L- (\V| + |E|) -d,-T). The total time complexity of NeGPR is: O(n, - (ZL: (|V| + |E|)-dg +|V|-(V| + |E])) +2 -d,) + O(ne- L- (\V| + El) -d,-T). C. Dataset Table 4: Statistics of the experimental datasets.

The dataset statistics can be found in Table 4, and their details are shown as follows: ¢ For structure-based domain shifts: PROTEINS. The PROTEINS dataset (Dobson and Doig 2003) contains 1,113 protein graphs. Each graph is labeled to indicate whether the corresponding protein is an enzyme. Nodes represent amino acids, and edges are constructed between amino acids within 6 A along the sequence. We divide the PROTEINS dataset into four subsets, PO, P1, P2, and P3, based on edge density, node density, and graph flux, which exhibit significant domain shifts. NCI1. The NCI1 (Wale, Watson, and Karypis 2008) dataset consists of 4,100 molecular graphs, with atoms as nodes and chemical bonds as edges. Each graph is labeled based on its ability to inhibit cancer cell growth. Following the PROTEINS dataset, we divide the NCI1 dataset into four subsets, NO, N1, N2, and N3, based on edge density, node density, and graph flux. FRANKENSTEIN. The FRANKENSTEIN (Orsini, Frasconi, and De Raedt 2015) dataset comprises 4,337 molecular graphs, with atoms as nodes and chemical bonds as edges. Each graph is labeled according to the molecule’s biological activity. Following the PROTEINS dataset, we divide the FRANKENSTEIN dataset into four subsets, FO, Fl, F2, and F3, based on edge density, node density, and graph flux. MUTAGENICITY. The MUTAGENICITY (Kazius, McGuire, and Bursi 2005) dataset includes 4,337 molecular graphs, where atoms serve as nodes and chemical bonds as edges. Labels indicate whether a compound is mutagenic, contributing to research in toxicology and chemical risk assessment. Following the PROTEINS dataset, we divide the MUTAGENIC- ITY dataset into four subsets, MO, M1, M2, and M3, based on edge density, node density, and graph flux. ¢ For feature-based domain shifts: DD. The DD dataset (Dobson and Doig 2003) contains 1,178 graphs representing protein structures, where nodes rep- resent amino acids and edges capture spatial or chemical proximity. DD graphs are larger and denser than PROTEINS graphs, introducing structural variations while maintaining similar label semantics. COX2. The COX2 dataset (Sutherland, O’brien, and Weaver 2003) contains 467 molecular graphs, while COX2-MD includes 303 modified molecular graphs. In both datasets, nodes represent atoms and edges correspond to chemical bonds. COX2_MD introduces structural variations to COX2 while maintaining semantic consistency, making them suitable for evaluating model robustness under domain shifts. BZR. The BZR dataset (Sutherland, O’brien, and Weaver 2003) consists of 405 molecular graphs. The BZR_MD dataset contains 306 graphs with modified structures derived from BZR. Nodes correspond to atoms, and edges represent chemical bonds. BZR_MD introduces structural variations to simulate domain shifts while maintaining consistent label semantics. Data processing In our implementation, we first process the raw graph-structured data, where each instance comprises an adjacency matrix, node features, and a graph-level label. Then, node representations are generated using available information, such as labels, attributes, or structural statistics, to ensure consistency across graphs. Furthermore, we incorporate path-based features and subgraph samples obtained through topology-aware and random sampling strategies to enhance structural representation. These components are integrated into a unified representation that captures global topology and local substructure information. D. Baselines In this part, we introduce the details of the compared baselines as follows: Graph kernel method. We compare our NeGPR with two graph kernel methods: — WL: The Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) subtree method (Shervashidze et al. 2011) iteratively refines node labels by hashing the concatenation of each node’s current label and the sorted multiset of its neighbors’ labels. This process enables efficient and expressive encoding of hierarchical structural features. — PathNN: Path Neural Networks (PathNN) (Michel et al. 2023) enhance expressiveness by explicitly modeling paths between nodes. They aggregate path-based features through attention mechanisms, capturing higher-order structural de- pendencies beyond immediate neighbors while preserving permutation invariance and computational efficiency. Graph neural networks. We compare our NeGPR with four general graph neural networks: — GCN: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) (Kipf and Welling 2017b) update node representations by aggregating and transforming features from immediate neighbors. They employ a normalized adjacency matrix to ensure numerical stability and preserve local graph structure during message passing. — GIN: Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) (Xu et al. 2018) aggregate features from neighboring nodes using a sum op- eration, followed by a multi-layer perceptron. This design enables maximally expressive representations while mitigating over-smoothing through injective aggregation functions. — GAT: Graph Attention Networks (GAT) (Veliékovié et al. 2018) compute node representations by assigning learnable attention weights to neighboring nodes through self-attention mechanisms. This allows for adaptive, weighted feature aggregation without relying on predefined graph structures or normalization constraints. — GMT: Graph Multiset Transformer (GMT) (Baek, Kang, and Hwang 2021) employs attention-based pooling with learn- able queries to aggregate node features into graph-level representations. It decouples feature selection from structural bias, enabling flexible and expressive global information extraction. Label denoising methods. We compare our NeGPR with five label denoising methods: — Co-teaching: Co-teaching (Han et al. 2018) trains two networks simultaneously, where each selects small-loss samples to teach the other, effectively filtering out noisy labels. This mutual-update strategy dynamically adjusts sample selection, enhancing robustness against severe label noise. — RTGNN: RTGNN (Qian et al. 2023) introduces a noise governance framework for graph neural networks by identify- ing and mitigating noisy nodes through confidence estimation and adaptive neighbor selection. It further incorporates consistency regularization to ensure stable representation learning under noisy supervision. -— Taylor-CE: Taylor-CE (Feng et al. 2021) enhances the robustness of cross-entropy loss to label noise by approximating it with a Taylor series expansion, which attenuates the influence of mislabeled samples through bounded gradients and smoother optimization dynamics. - OMG: OMG (Yin et al. 2023c) mitigates label noise in graph classification by jointly optimizing graph embeddings and label reliability. It employs an online sample reweighting mechanism that dynamically adjusts the training focus based on prediction confidence and noise estimation. — SPORT: SPORT (Yin et al. 2024a) addresses label noise by modeling graph classification from a subgraph perspec- tive, identifying reliable substructures through contrastive learning and sample selection. These substructures are then integrated using a noise-tolerant voting mechanism to enhance representation fidelity. Graph domain adaptation methods. We compare our NeGPR with six graph domain adaptation methods: — DEAL: DEAL (Yin et al. 2022b) is an unsupervised domain adaptation framework that aligns source and target domains at both the feature and prediction levels using adversarial learning. It further enhances cross-domain generalization by iteratively refining pseudo-labels through entropy minimization and consistency regularization. — CoCo: CoCo (Yin et al. 2023b) introduces a coupled contrastive framework that simultaneously aligns instance-level and class-level representations across domains to capture both fine-grained and semantic-level consistency. It leverages contrastive objectives to enhance feature discrimination and cross-domain coherence. -— SGDA: SGDA (Qiao et al. 2023) integrates semi-supervised learning with domain adaptation by leveraging limited la- beled target data to guide feature alignment between domains. It employs consistency regularization and entropy mini- mization to enhance representation transfer and reduce domain shift. — A2GNN: A2GNN (Liu et al. 2024a) reexamines feature propagation in graph domain adaptation by introducing a structure-aware propagation strategy that mitigates noise amplification. It further incorporates domain-specific normal- ization to enhance stability and alignment during unsupervised adaptation. — StruRW: StruRW (Liu et al. 2023) introduces a structural re-weighting mechanism that dynamically adjusts the impor- tance of nodes and edges based on their domain relevance. It enhances feature alignment by emphasizing transferable structures while suppressing domain-specific noise. — PA-BOTH: PA-BOTH (Liu et al. 2024b) leverages pairwise alignment to explicitly match semantically similar node pairs across domains, enhancing structural and feature-level consistency. It further refines domain adaptation by integrating alignment signals into the representation learning process. * Label denoising domain adaptation methods. We compare our NeGPR with two label denoising domain adaptation meth- ods: — ALEX: ALEX (Yuan et al. 2023a) proposes a noise-robust graph transfer learning framework that addresses label noise in the source domain through adaptive label correction and structure-aware contrastive learning. It jointly refines pseudo- labels and aligns domain-invariant representations to improve cross-domain generalization under noisy supervision. — ROAD: ROAD (Feng et al. 2023) introduces a robust Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) framework that combats source label noise and domain shift by combining source sample weighting, confident target regularization, and adversar- ial alignment. It enhances model generalization by jointly filtering noisy labels and promoting cross-domain consistency. For GCN, GIN, GAT, and GMT, we implement the models using PyTorch Geometric!. For the other baseline methods, we utilize the official source code released by the respective authors. All models are trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10~4, a hidden embedding dimension of 256, a weight decay of 10~!?, and GNN layers of 4. E. More experimental results More Performance Comparison In this part, we provide additional results for our proposed method NeGPR compared with all baseline models across various datasets, as illustrated in Table 8-18. These results consistently show that NeGPR outperforms the baselines in most cases, validating the superiority of our proposed method. More Ablation study To validate the effectiveness of the different components in NeGPR, we conduct more experiments with four variants on the NCI1, FRANKENSTEIN and MUTAGENICITY datasets, i.e., NeGPR w/o IB, NeGPR w/o EB, NeGPR w/o NRL, and NeGPR w/o NTR. The results are shown in Table 5 , 6 and 7. From the results, we have similar observations as summarized in Section 4.3. More Sensitivity Analysis In this part, we provide additional results about the flexible architecturesensitivity analysis of the proposed NeGPR with respect to the impact of its hyperparameters: threshold ¢ and noise ratio a on the NCI1, FRANKENSTEIN, and MUTAGENICITY datasets. The results are illustrated in Figure 4 and 5, where we observe trends similar to those discussed in Section 4.4. More Flexible Architecture In this part, we provide additional results about the flexible architecture of the proposed NeGPR on the NCI1, FRANKEN- STEIN, and MUTAGENICITY datasets. The results are illustrated in Figure 6 and 7, where we observe trends similar to those discussed in Section 4.5. “https://www.pyg.org/ 0.75 0.75 0.70 —*— NO->NI —® NO>N2 —* M0->MI1 —@ M0->M2 —*— FO>FI —@- FO->F2 -®- NINO -@- N2->NO -®- MI1->M0 = -@- M2->M0 -®- FI>FO -@- F2->F0 a a a i”) i”) 4 i”) 4 s 4 s 0.70 ee Fs 0.65 BS 0.65 7 @---555 e------ , ol ~~ 5 5 3 3 0.65 ~—— rt 3 0.60 < - < e------ ee----- -—— Te ° < . --- oe @------ @------ - 0.55 “+ T T T T 0.60 “+ T T T T 0.55 "+ T T T T 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 (a) NCI (b) MUTAGENICITY (c) FRANKENSTEIN Figure 4: Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis of threshold ¢ on the NCI1, MUTAGENICITY, and FRANKENSTEIN datasets. 0.75 0.75 0.70 —*— NONI —@- NO->N2 —*t— M0->MI1 —@ M0->M2 —e— FO>FI —@ FO->F2 —w- NINO -@- N2->NO | -*- M1->MO -@- M2->M0O —w- FIl>FO -@- F2->F0 a a a s s 0.70 4 s 0.65 4 Ss 0.655 5 5 3 3 0.65 3 0.60 < <0 <0 0.55 “+ ‘ ‘ T ‘ 0.60 ——+ ‘ ‘ T T 0.55 “+ ‘ ‘ T ‘ 0.1 0.2 03 0.4 0.5 0.1 0.2 03 0.4 0.5 0.1 0.2 03 0.4 0.5 (a) NCI (b) MUTAGENICITY (c) FRANKENSTEIN Figure 5: Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis of noise ratio a on the NCI1, MUTAGENICITY, and FRANKENSTEIN datasets. 0.7 0.8 0.7 lm GCN GAT GIN.

Jianxin Pang’ Dong Xu’* ' School of Computing and Data Science, The University of Hong Kong ? School of Engineering, Westlake University 3 School of Information and Physical Sciences, University of Newcastle “ UBTech Robotics Corp. {yimingwu, dongxu}@hku.hk Abstract Diffusion Policies have significantly advanced robotic manipulation tasks via imitation learning, but their appli- cation on resource-constrained mobile platforms remains challenging due to computational inefficiency and exten- sive memory footprint. In this paper, we propose LightDP, a novel framework specifically designed to accelerate Diffu- sion Policies for real-time deployment on mobile devices. LightDP. addresses the computational bottleneck through two core strategies: network compression of the denoising modules and reduction of the required sampling steps. We first conduct an extensive computational analysis on exist- ing Diffusion Policy architectures, identifying the denoising network as the primary contributor to latency. To over- come performance degradation typically associated with conventional pruning methods, we introduce a unified prun- ing and retraining pipeline, optimizing the model’s post- pruning recoverability explicitly. Furthermore, we combine pruning techniques with consistency distillation to effec- tively reduce sampling steps while maintaining action pre- diction accuracy. Experimental evaluations on the standard datasets, i.e., PushT; Robomimic, CALVIN, and LIBERO, demonstrate that LightDP achieves real-time action pre- diction on mobile devices with competitive performance, marking an important step toward practical deployment of diffusion-based policies in resource-limited environments. Extensive real-world experiments also show the proposed LightDP can achieve performance comparable to state-of- the-art Diffusion Policies. 1. Introduction Diffusion Policies have demonstrated significant success in robotic manipulation tasks through imitation learning, as evidenced by various studies [1, 4, 8, 15, 24, 26, 36, 37, “Corresponding authors: Huan Wang and Dong Xu. [EMAIL].cn du.au zhenghao.chen@newcastle. 44, 46, 51, 53]. This success fuels the ambition to de- ploy general-purpose embodied agents in robots, partic- ularly those with limited computation resources. How- ever, this endeavor presents multifaceted challenges: 1) Diffusion Policies require multiple denoising steps, which slows down the generation process; 2) the standard archi- tectures [8, 36, 37] involve billions of parameters, lead- ing to high memory usage. These factors impede real-time applications on resource-constrained platforms like mobile robots and drones. To address these challenges, recent work by DeeR-VLA [49] introduces a multi-exit architec- ture built on the Roboflamingo framework [26], enabling dynamic termination of the computation process to acceler- ate action prediction. While this design achieves consider- able computation reduction on GPU devices, its early exit strategy remains suboptimally tuned for mobile platforms. In this work, we introduce a novel framework named LightDP for Diffusion Policies that enables mod- els to achieve real-time generation on mobile devices. To achieve this, we mainly focus on two primary strategies: compressing the denoising network to improve the infer- ence speed and reducing the sampling steps. First, we pro- vide an analysis of two Diffusion Policies named Diffusion- Policy Transformer (DP-T) [8] and MDT-V [36]. Through the comprehensive component evaluation, we observe that the denoiser is the major bottleneck for Diffusion Policies (as shown in Table 1). In this work, we follow the conven- tional model pruning pipeline, in which the model is pruned and re-trained to resist the performance drop. In previ- ous pruning approaches based on importance metrics [31], oracle design [23], or lottery hypothesis [13], the pruning and retraining process is separated, which can lead to sub- optimal performance. In contrast, we integrate the prun- ing and retraining process in a unified framework, which can enhance the recoverability of the Diffusion Policies and explicitly model and optimize the post-finetuning per- formance of pruned models. Second, reducing the sam- pling steps is another straightforward way to speed up diffu- sion policies, but it would result in inevitable performance degradation without distillation. To preserve the prediction of initial action with fewer inference steps, we integrate the pruning strategies introduced with consistency distilla- tion [41, 43]. With the proposed LightDP, we show efficient diffusion policies on mobile devices, which can achieve real-time generation with competitive performance in three data sets. Our contributions are summarized as follows: e We present a novel framework for Diffusion Policies to obtain the efficient diffusion transformer that achieves real-time action prediction on the mobile device signifi- cantly faster than the original models. To our knowledge, this is the first work to address deploy- ing Diffusion Policies on mobile devices. We provide a comprehensive analysis of these policies’ computational cost and memory footprint. We integrate the pruning and step distillation process in a unified framework that enhances the recoverability of the models under the extensive benchmarking on the widely used datasets, e.g., Push-T, Robomimic, CALVIN, and LIBERO. The extensive real-world evaluations present the effectiveness of our approach in practical scenarios. 2. Related Work 2.1. Diffusion Policies Several studies have investigated the application of dif- fusion models [19, 22, 40] on policy learning, such as BESO [35] Diffusion Policy [8], MDT [36], and MOoDE [37]. Some approaches integrate pretrained visual- language models [36] directly into end-to-end visuomotor manipulation policies but these often involve significant ar- chitectural constraints or require calibrated cameras, lim- iting their generalizability. Further extension on 3D rep- resentations [50] enable the model to tackle complex 3D robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating superior perfor- mance compared to traditional methods. Despite the suc- cess of these methods, they often require extensive fine- tuning and are computationally expensive, limiting their de- ployment on resource-constrained devices. Reuss et al. [37] propose an MoE-based policy network that can be trained end-to-end, and only a few parameters are activated dur- ing inference, reducing the computational cost significantly. And some concurrent work [2, 15, 39, 49] explored accel- erating the inference of VLA models. In this work, we focus on compressing the policy models and deploying the model on resource-constrained devices, such as smartphones and NVIDIA Jetson devices. 2.2. Network Pruning for Diffusion Models Due to the significant computational demands of diffusion models, many works aim to enhance efficiency by either pruning network components [6, 7, 9, 17, 25, 45] or em- ploying knowledge distillation [18, 32, 38]. The former tar- gets reducing the model’s size while the latter cuts down on the number of required denoising steps. For instance, Li et al. introduced SnapFusion [27], an early method that accelerates diffusion models by modifying the architecture through channel and block pruning alongside distillation techniques. SnapFusion determines the importance of each block by evaluating both the degradation in CLIP score and the gain in inference speed, and the blocks are removed us- ing a “trial-and-error” procedure [33, 34]: those causing the smallest drop in CLIP score and the largest boost in speed are considered less critical. Additionally, SnapFusion in- corporates a CFG-aware distillation loss to better align the outputs of a pruned (student) model with those of its origi- nal (teacher) one after classifier-free guidance is applied. Ina similar vein, BK-SDM [23] accelerates Stable Diffu- sion by eliminating entire weight blocks, although it relies solely on the CLIP score to assess importance. A subse- quent finetuning step based on feature distillation helps re- cover performance, achieving a reduction in model size of around 30% to 50% with marginal performance loss. The resultant model is then further refined into EdgeFusion [5] based on a robust distillation method named LCM [29]. Furthermore, Google’s MobileDiffusion [52] applies pruning to shrink model size but goes a step further by introducing additional architectural modifications. These include adding more transformer layers in the U-Net’s in- termediate stages, reducing the number of channels, and decoupling self-attention from cross-attention to enhance performance. Complemented by a specific distillation loss inspired by SnapFusion and UFOGen [48], it achieves re- markably fast inference speeds reportedly around 0.2 sec- onds on iPhone 15 Pro. In parallel, SANA-1.5 [47] presents a linear diffusion transformer that introduces a block-level importance analy- sis for model depth pruning, enabling compression to arbi- trary sizes with minimal quality drop. The pruned SANA models can even be scaled back up at inference via a repeated sampling strategy to match larger-model perfor- mance. In the realm of on-device applications, Edge-SD- SR [16] adapts Stable Diffusion for super-resolution by trimming the model to only 169M parameters through a specialized bidirectional conditioning design and joint training, enabling 4x upscaling in 1.1s on mobile hardware while matching or surpassing dedicated super-resolution methods in quality. 3. Preliminaries Diffusion Models. Diffusion models [22, 42] are a class of generative models that iteratively produce data by grad- ually adding and removing noise. They involve two main processes: 1. Forward Diffusion Process: Noise is progres- sively added to the input data, transforming it into a noise- like distribution. 2. Reverse Denoising Process: The orig- inal input is reconstructed from the noisy data by progres- sively removing the added noise. Within a continuous-time framework, adding independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian noise with standard deviation o to the data distribution paata(xo) results in a noisy distribution p(x; oc). As o increases from a small value omin to a large value Omax> P(@; Cmax) approximates pure noise. The probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) describes the evolution of the data under this noise addition: da = —6; 0; Vz log p(a, ox) dt, (1) where Vz log p(a, o;) is the score function, often approx- imated by 2°)—® Within the EDM [22] framework, the denoising function Dg (xz, 01) is parameterized as: Do = Cskip(t) axe + Cout (t) fo (Cin (t)axz, Cnoise (t)), (2) where fg is a neural network trained to minimize the L? denoising error, and Cskip, Cins Cout, aNd Choise are time- dependent coefficients. Consistency Models. Consistency models, a family of gen- erative models, are designed to generate data efficiently by directly mapping noisy inputs to their clean counterparts in a single step. They enforce a self-consistency property that ensures the model’s outputs remain invariant across dif- ferent noise levels, i.¢., fo(a:,t) = fo(ay,t’), where x; and a4 are samples taken at different time steps t and t’ along the ODE trajectory. In the EDM framework, consis- tency models adopt the boundary conditions cgjp(0) = 1 and Cour(0) = 0. One approach to training these models, known as consistency distillation, involves refining a pre- trained diffusion model by minimizing the consistency loss: Lop (0,0; ¥) = i, E (fo (Linyertn+ks ) »fo- (@m".tn.))| , where d is a distance function, a is the data reversed by an ODE solver W with classifier-free guidance weight w, n is the time step of the pre-trained diffusion model, and k is the step interval.

Given the demonstration 7, a trajectory 7 € J is a sequence of observation o and robot action a, denoted as T = {(01,@1),...,(On,,@n,)}. A diffusion policy 74(alo, g) is trained to imitate the expert’s behavior by maximizing the log-likelihood of the action a Observation Encoder image Vision Encoder Perceiver i Diffusion Transformer >») action Lang |{ Vision Goal Goal prompt Goal Encoder Figure 1. The network architecture of MDT-V model. The model consists of three main components: the observation encoder E, the goal encoder G, and the diffusion transformer D. given the observation o and goal g. Under the multi-modal setting, the goal g is a high-level instruction that specifies the desired outcome of the task, could be a language instruc- tion or a target observation. Generally, the diffusion policy parameterized by ¢ is composed of an observation encoder FE, a diffusion transformer D, and a goal encoder G. The observation encoder F extracts features from the observa- tion o, while the diffusion transformer D generates the ac- tion a conditioned on the observation o and goal g. By substituting the notations into Equation |, diffusion policy estimates the score function Vq log p(alo, g) at timestep t via score matching as follows: Lpm = Eoa.e(0(01)||ts(ar,0,8,04) — all3], 4) where 74 = @ + 07Vqlogp(alo,g) is the neural net- work, a, is the noised action at timestep ¢, and a(o;) is the loss weight. The diffusion model is trained by minimiz- ing the score matching loss £piz, which encourages the model to generate actions that are consistent with the ex- pert’s demonstrations. In this work, we focus on accelerat- ing the pretrained policy models by pruning and distillation algorithms, and then deploy the models on the mobile de- vices for real-time robot manipulation. 4.2. Latency Analysis of Diffusion Policies Since the diffusion policy is designed for real-time robot manipulation, it is crucial to assess the on-device latency of the policy models. Given the structural similarities among these models, we use the MDT-V model as an example.

With the aid of LightDP, the diffusion transformers in DP-T and MDT-V achieve latency reductions from 90.6 ms and 22.25 ms to 2.72 ms and 4.1 ms, respectively. JE: Image Encoder, DT: Diffusion Transformer, GLE: Goal Language Encoder, NFE is short for the number of score function evaluations, i.e., inference steps., M: Million, ms: milliseconds. modalities of input, including an observation encoder for extracting the image features (i.e., the Voltron Network [21] for MDT-V model), a goal encoder for processing the high- level instruction (i.e., the CLIP Text Encoder), and a diffu- sion transformer for generating the robot action. As shown in Table |, we evaluate the latency of the DP- T and MDT-V models on iPhone13. For DP-T, the network consists of two major components, the image encoder em- ploys a ResNet18 model for converting the input image into embedding as the condition for the diffusion transformer, which costs a tiny portion of the total latency (1.28ms). The diffusion transformer is an 8-layer transformer, which is the main bottleneck of the model (90.6 ms), demands 100 iterative denoising steps to get the final action predic- tion. The similar observation can be found in the MDT-V model, where the Voltron network costs relatively less time (7.56ms) compared to the diffusion transformer (22.25ms), which slows down the on-device generation process. By breaking down the architecture of the policy models, we identify the bottleneck of the model, which is the diffu- sion transformer in both models. The architecture of the diffusion transformer can be formulated as a stack of N transformer blocks, where each block contains a multi-head attention layer (MHA) and a feed-forward network (FFN) layer, formulated as @, = FFN(MHA(-)). Since the diffu- sion transformer requires multiple denoising steps to gener- ate the action prediction, which leads to a high latency of the model. To address this issue, we propose to accelerate the model by pruning and distillation, as described in the following sections. 4.3. Prune the Model by Learning To obtain a smaller model, we adopt the layer pruning tech- nique to remove the redundant layers in the diffusion trans- former. Given the N-layer diffusion transformer, we aim to find a binary mask M(N) = {m1,mMo,..., mn} identi- fying the layers to be pruned, where m; € {0,1} indicates whether this layer is retained or pruned. Conventionally, the pruning process is formulated as an optimization problem to minimize the loss £ after pruning, which can be formulated as minyy,,. E, (L(x, 7¢,.M)], where ty = IN, @; is the vanilla model, and 7g is the model after pruning. However, this pruning problem is NP-hard [3, 14] since both the mask M and weight db are jointly optimized. To ad- dress this, a common approach is a two-stage pruning pro- cess: first determine the mask M (by minimizing the loss L with a given criterion), then fine-tune the pruned model to recover performance. However, this two-step approach can be suboptimal, since the model may not fully recover per- formance after pruning. To address this issue, we propose to use a single-stage pruning method [10], where the mask M and weight b are jointly optimized to minimize the loss £ after pruning. Specifically, the M is modeled as a probability distribu- tion M; ~ Bernoulli((p;)), where p; is the gate score op- timized during the training process. We leverage Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to estimate layer importance, since SVD is a common technique in model compression [17,25]. Compared to alternatives like Canonical Polyadic or Kronecker product decompositions, SVD provides sin- gular values that capture the most significant components of a weight matrix. We initialize the gate score with the SVD decomposition, which is formulated as: T(W) = ||W — SVD(W,k)|| = ||W — UL S,V Elle, (5) where W is the weight matrix of the transformer block, and SV D(W,,k) is the reconstructed weight matrix using the top-k singular values. Specifically, the SVD decomposition is applied to the weight matrix of each transformer block, including the query, key, and value weight matrix of the attention layer and MLP layers in the FFN module. Then, the gate score is initialized with the importance score by p= ile) where ¢; is the weight matrix in the 7-th Vids L(¢%) block of diffusion transformer. As shown in Figure 2, the model is trained with a learnable gate selection mechanism via Gumbel-Softmax trick [11, 20], which could be used to select the block to be pruned. If the 7-th block is dropped during training, we make its output identical to its input (an identity mapping)., which could be formulated as: Lig. = MoG;(xi) + 1 — m)axi, (6) where x; and @,(x;) represent the input and output of layer @;, respectively. The gate score is updated during the train- ing process, which could be used to select the block to be pruned. At the end of training, to obtain an N layer dif- fusion transformer, we select the N layers with the highest Target Model fg Goal a 4 a 4 a 4 a 4 9 a; § Sg Bg 88 8 S a S a S a S a Oo | Observation e F F F ODE Solver} o Action Teacher Model fy Moving Aerage (MDT-V / DP-T) rn Pruned Model fg PS ry ry 5 7 ge. 5 E E Ex 2 2 23 A >| F F F grasp the handle of the drawer g a and open it 9 Action A Action a t a Transformer Transformer Block Block vy Transformer Transformer Block Block Lea A Transformer Transformer Block J) ©LJLILIJ “" Block Transformer Transformer Block Block Transformer | |y Transformer | |x Block Nf Block ku v v € N Sample from (tr) combinations = ¢ Figure 2.

The Target Model is updated by the Student Model with a momentum update. In the right figure, we present the prune by learning technique used in our method, where a set of Bernoulli variables (gate score) is learned to perform the differentiable sampling of the pruned model, which is jointly optimized with the model parameters during the pruning process. gate score. To further recover the performance after prun- ing, we continue to fine-tune the model without adopting the mask selection process. 4.4. Step Distillation With the pruned model, the one-step inference speed could be significantly improved. However, the model still requires multiple denoising steps to obtain a high-quality action pre- diction, which raises a non-negligible computation cost. To address this issue, we employ the consistency distillation to train the model as a consistency model, which could achieve comparable performance with the original model but with fewer denoising steps. As introduced in Section 3, consistency distillation aims to train the model 74 to satisfy the consistency property across the different noise levels, denoted as T¢(@t,0,8,01) = Te(av,0, 8,01). The distilled model is reparameterized as EDM, which is formulated as: (Qe, oO, 8, or) = Cskip(t) ar +Cout (t) fo(cin (tae, Cnoise (t) (7) where Cskip, Cin, Couts ANd Cpoise Satisfy the boundary condi- tion, and fy is the distilled model.

Both Student Model and Target Model are initialized with the Teacher Model. 5. Experiments In this section, we introduce the experimental settings, in- cluding the baselines, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics in Section 5.1. And introduce the details about baselines used in our experiments, as well as the implementation de- tails in Section 5.2. Subsequently, we present the main re- sults and the analysis of our experiments in Section 5.3. 5.1. Benchmarks and Evaluation Metrics We evaluate our method on the following benchmarks: ¢ Push-T was first introduced in IBC [12] used to evaluate the performance of Diffusion Policies. This task is de- signed to test the embodied agent’s ability to manipulate objects with a fixed end-effector. In the task, the agent is required to push a T-shaped block into a target goal zone, which is marked by green lines in a table. The task is var- ied by changing the initial position of the block and the end-effector. And the task provides two types of observa- tions: RGB images and keypoint-based states. In the ex- periments, we use both types of observations to evaluate the performance of our method. And we follow the evalu- ation protocol adopted in Diffusion Policy [8] to evaluate the success rate of the manipulation task. CALVIN [30] is a simulation benchmark for measuring the performance of long-horizon language-conditioned tasks. The benchmark dataset is split into four manipu- lation environments, A, B, C, and D. The environments share a similar structure, like a table with objects on it, but the objects and the goal are not always the same. The agent is requested to follow the instructions to manipulate the objects on the table to achieve the goal. There are 6- hour human-teleoperated recording data in each environ- ment, and only 1% of the data is annotated with language instructions. We use the Average Rollout Length as the main evaluation metric in the experiments. LIBERO [28] was developed for long-life robotic deci- sion making to build the generalist agent that can per- form a wide range of tasks. The benchmark comprises 130 tasks across 4 suites: LIBERO-Spatial, LIBERO- Object, LIBERO-Goal, LIBERO-100. The first three suites are designed to test the agent’s ability to disentan- gle the transfer of declarative and procedural knowledge, while LIBERO-100 is a suite of 100 tasks with entangled knowledge transfer. 5.2. Implementation Details Base Models. Through this work, we have mentioned both DiffusionPolicy Transformer and MDT-V in terms of their wide use in imitation learning, especially in the object ma- nipulation tasks. As our purpose is to compress the model to make it more efficient and faster on mobile devices. We choose these two models as our base models. DiffusionPol- icy Transformer is a transformer-based policy network that only supports image input. The model consists of a diffu- sion transformer and a visual encoder. MDT is a multi-modal policy network that integrates the pre-trained multi-modal feature extractor named Voltron. We also implement MoDE, which is an MoE-based pol- icy network that achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the CALVIN and LIBERO benchmarks. In the experi- ments, we consider compressing the widely used Diffusion Policies, including Diffusion-Policy-T [8], and MDT [36]. Diffusion-Policy-T [8] is a transformer-based policy net- work for imitation learning that supports only image input. MDT [36], by integrating the pre-trained multi-modal fea- ture extractor named Voltron [21], MDT has achieved good results on the CALVIN dataset. Implementation Details. Our implementation is based on PyTorch. We conducted training on NVIDIA RTX 3090 and H800 GPUs. Then, we converted the model trained on GPU to Core ML model format (mlpackage, based on Ap- ple’s ml-stable-diffusion) and measured latency in Xcode Instruments on an iPhone 13 (A15 Bionic, 10S 18.3.1). For network pruning, we adopt the local block pruning scheme from TinyFusion [10] to build up a local block with scheme N:M. In this N:M scheme, each group of MM consecutive layers (a “block’) is pruned down to WN layers.. For instance, when we keep NV = 3 layers from a local block with M = 4 layers in total, we have (3) = 4 choices, corresponding to M = [[1,1,1,0], [1, 1,0, 1], [1,0,1, 1], [0,1,1,1]]. Our consistency distillation is applied to the model’s xo pre- diction (predicting the denoised action), following com- mon practice, and we start the EMA decay rate at 0.95 and gradually increase it to 0.999 over the course of training to stabilize the Target model updates. We use the DDIM Solver [40] for distillation, with a skip interval of 10 steps (i.e., distill every 10th diffusion step). We keep the most hyper-parameters consistent with the original implementa- tion of the base models. For DP-T, the input is a hybrid of RGB image and low-dimension state, the size of image is 84 x 84, and the observation sequence length is set as 2, the transformer block of the diffusion transformer is with the hidden size of 256, the number of heads is 4, and the number of layers in DP-T is 8. For MDT, the input is multi-modal, which includes two RGB images at different views as ob- servation and a language instruction as the goal. We adopt AdamwW as the optimizer with a learning rate of le — 4, and the batch size is set as 64. We train the model for 30 epochs on the CALVIN datasets, within the last epochs, the Student Model fs is pruned based on the gate score at 20-th epoch. 5.3. Evaluation on DiffusionPolicy Transformer In this section, we conduct the experiments based on DP-T as reported in Table 2, we can find that the pruned model can achieve a comparable success rate with the original model, but with a smaller model size and faster inference speed. Quantitative Results. The vanilla DP-T model contains 8 transformer blocks with alternative Multi-head Cross- Attention layers and Feed-Forward layers. The model is first trained to obtain an optimal pruning mask with the net- work weight updated jointly, then the model is pruned and trained via a consistency distillation loss. In our setting, we compress the model into 2, 4, and 6 layers. The results show that through our method, the pruned model can achieve a comparable success rate with the vanilla model. As we dis- cuss in When N://=1:2, each two successive blocks are grouped with one block pruned. With the same depth, we observe that when the capacity M of the block is reduced, the performance will be slightly reduced, since large M can provide more diverse pruning choices. Besides, from the perspective of the depth of the pruned model, we find that the performance of the larger depth model remains bet- ter than the smaller one, which is consistent with the intu- ition, but the performance gap is not significant. Especially, we find a 2-layer diffusion transformer can achieve a suc- cess rate with 0.724, which is quite close to the original Method Depth Param(M) NFE GFLOPs_ Inference Speed(ms) Success Rate DP-T 0.772+0.039 DP-T* 8 8.97 100 4.39 90.6 0.75440.023 DP-T-D6/6-8 0.752+0.019 DP-T-D6/4-4 6 6.87 4 0.134 4.79 0.732+40.034 DP-T-D4/4-8 0.747+0.010 DP-T-D4/2-4 4 4.76 4 0.091 2.72 0.732+0.013 DP-T-D4/1-2 0.757+0.018 DP-T-D2/2-8 0.73040.022 DP-T-D2/1-4 2.65 4 0.049 0.97 0.724+0.030 Table 2. Performance comparison of LightDP compressed models with varying depth and inference steps. All models are trained on the same Push-T dataset for 3K epochs. DP-T™ refers to the baseline model evaluated by us. DP-T-DL/N-M indicates that L blocks are retained during the pruning process, with a local block scheme of N:M. NFE is short for the number of score function evaluations, i.e., inference steps. Detailed experiments on the Robomimic dataset are provided in Section H. model with 0.754. In contrast, the latency of the pruned model is greatly diminished when compared to the DP-T model. With the number of inference steps cut down to 4 and the depth limited to 2, we attain approximately 93 times speed improvement, and the FLOPs are decreased by 89.6%. These results indicate that our proposed LightDP successfully compresses the model while preserving the original model’s performance. 5.4. Evaluation on MDT-V In this section, we conduct the experiments based on MDT- V as reported in Table 3. Since MDT-V consists of 4-layer TransformerEncoder and 4-layer TransformerDecoder, we keep the number of encoder layers the same as the decoder layers, therefore, we compress the model into 2, 4, and 6 layers as well as DP-T. Compared with the original model, the 6-layer model achieves comparable performance, while the 4-layer model has a significant performance drop and the 2-layer model has the worst performance. The results show the MDT-V model is more compact than the DP-T model. In addition, as detailed in Table 3, the ABCD-—>D results reveal that the full MDT model attains very high suc- cess percentages across the chain (e.g., 98.6% on the first instruction, gradually decreasing to 80.1%), with an aver- age chain length of 4.52. In contrast, the pruned variants show a noticeable decline in performance, where MDT- V/E1-D1, for instance, achieves only 92.3% initially and drops to 61.4%, with a reduced average chain length of 3.44. Similarly, in the DD scenario, all models register lower performance, with the most compressed model suf- fering from a steep decline in both success rate and average chain length. These observations underscore the trade-off between model compactness and performance, highlight- ing that even a slight reduction in network depth can sub- stantially impact the ability to sustain performance over extended inference sequences. Besides, we also conduct the experiments on the LIBERO datasets shown in Table 4, by comparing MDT-V and MDT-V/E3-D3 across LIBERO task suites, we find that the pruned model achieves com- parable performance with the original model. On average, while MDT-V shows a marginally better overall result with less variability, the inference speed and model size are re- duced significantly, which could be beneficial for deploy- ment on mobile devices. 5.5. Ablation Study In this section, we ablate the effectiveness of the proposed method by removing the consistency distillation and learn- able pruning. As shown in Table 5, when learnable pruning is applied (MDT-V w/prune), we observe a reduction in the number of parameters and GFLOPs, along with slightly re- duced latency (from 22.25ms to 18.87ms), while preserving similar behavior in the generated actions. Likewise, em- ploying consistency distillation (MDT-V w/CD) consider- ably reduces the GFLOPs and latency with only minimal reduction in the average rollout length. Notably, the com- bined approach (MDT-V/E3-D3) delivers the best trade- off by minimizing latency and computational cost, thereby demonstrating the efficiency of our design modifications without significant degradation in performance. 5.6. Qualitative Results Figure 3 displays rollout of the pruned DP-T and MDT-V models on the Push-T and LIBERO tasks. In the Push-T task, the pruned model successfully pushed the T-shaped block into the goal zone, without any failure in the manipu- lation process.

We observe that the pruned models can mimic the behaviors of the original models, which demonstrates the step distillation process is capable of transferring the knowledge from the original model to the pruned model. Except for the experiments on simula- tion environments, we also conduct the real-world experi- ments on robotic arms as presented in Section I. The results show that the pruned model can achieve a comparable suc- cess rate with the original model, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in real-world scenarios. 6. Conclusion and Limitation In this paper, we introduced the LightDP framework, aim- ing at accelerating Diffusion Policies on the mobile devices. Specifically, we analyze the architecture of the widely-used DP-T and MDT-V baselines, observe the iterative denois- ing process, and the high cost of the network inference hur- dles the real-time application of these models on the mo- bile robots. To address this issue, we employed two strate- gies: 1) adopting a lightweight network architecture via a learnable pruning method, and 2) reducing the number of inference steps to speed up the denoising process. We have benchmarked the proposed LightDP framework on Push-T, Robomimic, CALVIN, and LIBERO datasets, demonstrat- ing a significant improvement in terms of inference speed and memory consumption. Limitations. In this paper, we mainly focus on the Dif- fusion Policies, while the new proposed VLA models are not well explored in this work. We leave this as the future work.

2508.00712v1 [cs.LG] 1 Aug 2025 arXiv JSON-Bag: A generic game trajectory representation Dien Nguyen, Diego Perez-Liebana, Simon Lucas Queen Mary University of London - Game AI Group d.l.nguyen, diego.perez, simon.lucas @qmul.ac.uk Abstract—We introduce JSON Bag-of-Tokens model (JSON- Bag) as a method to generically represent game trajectories by tokenizing their JSON descriptions and apply Jensen-Shannon distance (JSD) as distance metric for them. Using a prototype- based nearest-neighbor search (P-NNS), we evaluate the validity of JSON-Bag with JSD on six tabletop games—7 Wonders, Dominion, Sea Salt and Paper, Can’t Stop, Connect4, Dots and boxes—each over three game trajectory classification tasks: classifying the playing agents, game parameters, or game seeds that were used to generate the trajectories. Our approach outperforms a baseline using hand-crafted fea- tures in the majority of tasks. Evaluating on N-shot classification suggests using JSON-Bag prototype to represent game trajectory classes is also sample efficient. Additionally, we demonstrate JSON-Bag ability for automatic feature extraction by treating tokens as individual features to be used in Random Forest to solve the tasks above, which significantly improves accuracy on underperforming tasks. Finally, we show that, across all six games, the JSD between JSON-Bag prototypes of agent classes highly correlates with the distances between agents’ policies. Index Terms—JSON, game representation, game state, game trajectory, Jensen-Shannon distance, random forest I. INTRODUCTION Defining features and representations for games and their corresponding distance/similarity metric is foundational for any task that requires game analysis. Designing agents to play a game in a certain way (either to optimize playing strength [1], model human players (2). or optimize playstyle diver- sity (3) often requires hand-crafted features using domain knowledge. Automated game design and content generation requires defining game metrics to evaluate generated solutions |4|. In these tasks, instead of only optimizing for the targeted fitness functions, optimizing also for diversity and novelty in the solution population can produce better results (3). Diversity in the population is usually enforced by either defining behavior criteria that partition the search space (6) or using a distance metric to evaluate the novelty of new solutions (5). Data mining and analysis of game data, such as playstyle clustering (7). also use distance and similarity metrics to discover patterns in the data. In the majority of cases, features and representations are defined manually using domain knowledge or automatically using deep-learning models. The latter case often still requires feature engineering and further tuning to adapt to specific use cases. The distance and similarity metrics of choice are typically Euclidean distance and cosine similarity (8). This work proposes the JSON Bag-of-token model (JSON- Bag) to generically represent game trajectories by tokenizing their JSON descriptions. The JSON representation for a game trajectory is simply formed by concatenating the JSON of individual game states, serialized from the game objects’ data, into a list. A JSON-Bag is a collection of token-occurrence count pairs from tokenizing the game trajectory in JSON. We interpret JSON-Bag as a probabilistic model of game trajectories and use the Jensen-Shannon distance (JSD) (9) to measure similarity between them. To validate our approach, we test it on six tabletop games— 7 Wonders, Dominion, Sea Salt and Paper, Can’t Stop, Con- nect4, Dots and boxes, each on three classification tasks: classifying different playing agents, game parameters, and game seeds. For each task, a classifier uses JSON-Bag as the representation to classify game trajectories into the correct class of agents, game parameters, or game seeds that have been used to generate the trajectories. Using a prototype- based nearest neighbor search algorithm (P-NNS), we compare JSON-Bag with JSD against a baseline with hand-crafted features and Euclidean distance and show that our approach outperforms the baseline in the majority of cases. The first three games above have many unique game components, therefore sensible hand-crafted features are easy to define and the JSON-serialized game states are rich in information. We call the other three games “sparse” games, meaning they have few unique game components. For ex- ample, 7 Wonders has coins, material resources, and multiple unique cards, while Connect4 only has a grid with a unique board piece type for each player. For sparse games, their JSON descriptions are therefore not as informative and P-NNS performance degrades. However, by applying Random Forest (RF) with minimal tuning, JSON-Bag performance signifi- cantly improves on tasks P-NNS underperformed, especially on sparse games. This further validates JSON-Bag’s ability for automatic feature extraction and suggests the potential to use JSON-Bag with more sophisticated feature selection methods and models that can learn interactions between features. A JSON-Bag prototype of a class is a single JSON-Bag that best represents a class of game trajectories. We evaluate N-shot classification for JSON-Bag P-NNS to show that JSON-Bag prototypes efficiently represent game trajectory classes, only needing a few samples per class to accurately classify classes with “obvious” differences. This is useful for the application of diversity/novelty search, such as in playstyle modeling (3). to determine the novelty of new solutions. JSON-Bag prototype being sample efficient means a new solution would not require many game trajectories for its novelty to be estimated by JSD. We compare the JSD between JSON-Bag prototypes of different playing agent classes to their actual behavioral differ- ences. The JSD of JSON-Bag prototypes is found to be highly correlated with the average distance in the agents’ policies. The main contributions of this paper are: e JSON-Bag: A method to generically represent game tra- jectories using only the JSON descriptions of individual game states for tokenization. We describe a domain- agnostic method of tokenizing that works well across a diverse range of tabletop games. JSON serialization is general and many game implementations are able to either directly serialize game states to JSON or require little coding effort. JSON-Bag enables comparing JSON game logs without further domain-specific processing. We show that game trajectory similarity can be eval- uated using a probabilistic interpretation of JSON-Bag with Jensen-Shannon distance, a probability distribution distance metric well-founded in information theory. e We demonstrate the sample efficiency of JSON-Bag prototypes for game trajectory classes representation and their ability to automatically extract game features to be used in other methods of feature selection. We show that the JSD between JSON-Bag prototypes of different types of agents highly correlates with their behavioral difference measured by a policy distance. II. BACKGROUND In traditional board game research, abundant work has been done to determine which game features to extract for different tasks (game-playing agents, game analysis, procedural content generation, etc.). In Go, Silver et. al. use local board features in a value function approximator to build a strong playing agent. Browne [4] introduces an extensive set of game metrics to evaluate the overall game structure and aesthetics in the context of automated board game generation. With the advances of deep learning, AlphaZero is a framework taking advantage of neural networks’ ability for automatic feature learning and self-play reinforcement learning to build a superhuman Go, Chess, and Shogi agent without domain knowledge [10]. In video games, due to more complex game dynamics, hand-crafted features are difficult to define, so a common choice of game state representation is the raw pixels and the game memory values (8). Game sprite-sheets can also be used together with object recognition to learn a graph representation of the game system (11). Player telemetry data is often used as game trajectory representation in playstyle analysis (7). Video game description languages (VGDL) are general frameworks of symbolic representation to describe game states and game systems. PYVGDL and Ludii are examples of VGDL used for 2D arcade games and abstract board games, respectively. Although VGDLs are useful encodings for game generation and analysis, they are narrow in scope and not applicable to existing games without extensive manual effort. Distance or similarity metrics are an essential component in game data mining to quantify the similarity between objects of interest, such as game trajectories in playstyle clustering (7). These metrics are also used in Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms to determine the novelty of new solutions, which have seen wide usage in game content generation and game-playing agents (15). The most common choices of metrics are the Euclidean distance and cosine similarity. III. GAMES The following games are used in our experiments, using their implementation in the TAG framework [16]. 7 Wonders (Antoine Bauza, 2010): Players draft cards to build their civilizations, interacting with neighbors by passing cards and buying resources. Each player is randomly assigned a Wonder with unique special abilities. Dominion (Donald X. Vaccarino, 2008): Players build their deck by purchasing cards from a fixed common pool to create an “engine” to acquire victory point cards in the late game. This paper uses the “First Game” card set up. Sea Salt and Paper (Bruno Cathala, 2022): A set-collection game where players draw cards to create card combos that maximize their score. Players can choose when and how to end the round—higher risk options can gain or lose them points. We call the following games sparse, meaning they have few unique game components. For example, 7 Wonders has coins, resources, and multiple unique cards, while Connect4 only has a grid with a unique board piece type per player. Connect4 (Milton Bradley, 1974): Players take turns drop- ping board pieces into a vertical grid to connect four of their pieces in a row, column, or diagonal before their opponent. 8 x 8 is the default grid size for this paper. Dots and boxes (Edouard Lucas, 1889): Players take turns placing a link between adjacent dots on a grid, until filled. When a player forms a box on their turn, they score one point and play another turn. Can’t Stop (Sid Sackson, 1980): A push-your-luck dice game with eleven number tracks, from 2 to 12. Players roll four dice to form two sums and advance markers on corresponding number tracks, aiming to complete three tracks before their opponents. Players must decide whether to stop or keep rolling to advance and risk losing progress. IV. JSON BAG-OF-TOKENS MODEL The JSON Bag-of-tokens model (JSON-Bag) represents game trajectories by tokenizing their JSON representation. The JSON of a game state is made by serializing the data of every game component, with the specific serialization structure depending on the game implementation. The JSON of a game trajectory is simply an ordered-list of all the JSON game states. A. Tokenization We define a token of a JSON as each of its individual atomic components, identified by a string containing the path from the outermost level to that component, each level separated by a dot. In this paper, we define atomic components as anything that is neither a dictionary nor a list. For example, a snippet from a 7 Wonders JSON: nM fe WwW NY {"currentAge": 2, "playerResources": [ {"Wood": 2}, {"Wood": 2} ]} In this example, there are three atomic components on lines 1, 3, 4, all of which are integers. They can be tokenized as: ".currentAge.2", .playerResources.Wood.2", .playerResources.Wood.2" Since "playerResources" is a list storing the resources of each player, we may want to encode the ordering as well to retain information of player ownership: ",playerResources[0].Wood.2", ".playerResources[1].Wood.2" These tokens are then processed into a JSON-Bag, following the same principles as ’bag-of-words” from natural language processing (17). where the occurrences of each token are counted and combined into a token-occurrence count pait. Each game trajectory is a bag-of-tokens, and the occurrence values are normalized to sum to 1 within a bag to model a probability distribution. For the rest of this paper, unless specified otherwise, JSON-Bag is normalized by default. Using JSON-Bag does not entirely ignore the temporal aspects of game trajectories. E.g., in Poker, given the same final game state, having a specific card in hand at the beginning of the game would produce a JSON-Bag that is different from instead gaining that same card at a different time-step, since the former would have more occurrences of that card. B. Ordered vs. Unordered Tokenization A player’s hand of cards, for example, can be stored internally as a list, but for many card games the order does not matter. In this case, using ordered-tokenization would make tokens that should have been the same into distinct tokens, causing loss of information. A more sophisticated tokenization procedure would be aware of which list to be tokenized with or without ordering. In this paper, to demonstrate the simplicity of the method, we consider for each game to tokenize only in-order, or only unordered, or both, meaning any token involving a list is processed with both ordered and unordered tokenization. [Table Ijshows which tokenization mode is used for each game, which is decided based on preliminary testing. For all games, we did not make any fundamental changes to the data structure of the game object classes, only implement- ing the mechanism to serialize game states into JSON files. Our serialization does not include any explicit information on the actions taken by the players (e.g., action history). C. JSON-Bag Prototype A JSON-Bag prototype is simply the average of all bags of that specific class in the dataset, forming a single JSON-Bag | Game Tokenization mode | 7 Wonders unordered Dominion unordered Sea Salt and Paper unordered Can’t Stop both Connect4 ordered Dots and boxes ordered TABLE IT TOKENIZATION MODE USED FOR EACH GAME. that represents an entire class of game trajectories (e.g., all game trajectories generated by One-step-look-ahead (OSLA) agents). This is useful for cross-class analysis and prototype- based nearest-neighbor search (P-NNS). D. Interpretation Traditionally, bag-of-words models in natural language pro- cessing (NLP) are often understood as vector space model |17], where a bag of token-frequency pairs is a point or a unit vector in the hyperplane when used with Euclidean distance or cosine similarity, respectively. Instead, we interpret JSON-Bag as probabilistic models of game trajectories, meaning, the frequency value of a token is the probability that a game trajectory would “generate” that token during gameplay. We argue that this is a more intuitive interpretation of JSON-Bag than the vector space model. In this interpretation, a class of game trajectories has a single true probability distribution for all the trajectories, and a JSON- Bag prototype is the maximum-likelihood estimation of such a distribution for that class. This allows usage of divergence and distance metrics such as KullbackLeibler (KL) divergence and Jensen-Shannon distance (9) to analyze similarity between distributions. Similar interpretations of bag-of-words models have seen success in both NLP and other areas such as biomedical time-series analysis (20). V. JENSEN-SHANNON DISTANCE Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence (9) is an information- theoretic divergence based on Shannon entropy to measure the similarity between distributions. JS divergence is symmetric and bounded between [0,1], with 1 being identical distribu- tions. The square-root of this gives Jensen-Shannon distance (JSD), which is a metric (i.e., satisfies triangle inequality). For discrete distributions P and Q defined on the same sample space 1, the KL divergence between P and Q is: P(x) Q(x) Drx(PI|Q) = 0 Pla) log LEX (1) Given mixture distribution M = $(P+Q), the JS divergence between P and Q is: Dys(PIIQ) = ,Pei(PIIM) + 5Dei(Q\|M) —) JS divergence can be thought of as a symmetrized and smoothed version of KL divergence, where instead of directly comparing P and Q and having to choose a reference distri- bution, P and Q are compared as the reference distributions against the average distribution M/. The JSD between P and Q is then defined as: Distys(P,Q) = VDss(P\||Q) (3) To validate our approach, |subsection VII-D] compares the JSD between JSON-Bag prototypes and policy distance. Given two agents A and B, we define the policy distance between A and B over a set of game states S as: = So Distys(mals ),0 sES D,(A, B) z(s)) (4) ~ [S| where 74(s) is agent A policy at game state s. In other words, the policy distance between two agents over S is the average JSD between their policies over all game states s € S. VI. EXPERIMENTS A. Classifying game trajectories into classes of game agents, game parameters, and game seeds For each game, JSON-Bag model is tested on three classi- fication tasks (two for Connect4 and Dots and boxes), using full game trajectories as data points: e Game agents: Five agents: Random, One-step-look- ahead (OSLA), and three variants of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) (22). The OSLA agent adds a small random noise to each action value to break ties. For si- multaneous action games, i.e. 7 Wonders, OSLA evaluates each action by doing a single random rollout until all players have acted. The first MCTS agent is a vanilla open-loop MCTS using a single set of parameters for every game with a budget of 64ms per decision (MCTS- V). Then, for each game, the other two players are tuned with N-Tuple Bandit Evolutionary Algorithm (NTBEA) specifically for both game and budget the agent will run on: 64ms (MCTS64) and 128ms (MCTS128). e Game parameters: Four sets of game parameters. Cer- tain variables in the games are parameterized, such as grid size (Connect4, Dots and boxes), columns’ sizes (Can’t Stop), cards’ values (Sea Salt and Paper), number of cards available (Dominion), or resource price (7 Won- ders). Due to space, this is not a full list of parameters being varied, but certain games have larger parameter spaces than others. Each set of parameters is randomly generated within a predefined range for each parameter. e Game seeds: Four game seeds, each used to initialize the random number generator of the game instances. For each class, 500 games are played by game agents to generate game trajectories. For the game agents task, the agent of each class played against copies of itself to generate game trajectories. For game parameters and game seeds, all games are generated by copies of MCTS64 played at 32ms budget. All games are played with 4 players, except for Connect4 and Dots and Boxes, which are played with 2. For all models, datasets are split 50/50 for training and testing! | 'No validation set is needed since there is no hyperparameter tuning.

Prototype-based Nearest Neighbor Search (P-NNS) is a nearest neighbor classifier that classifies a data point into a class according to the closest prototype. With P-NNS as the classifier, JSON-Bag and JSD are compared against a baseline using handcrafted features and Euclidean distance in six games: 7 Wonders, Dominion, Sea Salt and Paper, Can’t Stop, Connect4, Dots and boxes. Similar to JSON-Bag prototypes, a prototype for hand-crafted features is a single feature vector averaging over all feature vectors of a class within the training data. Preliminary testing with K-nearest- neighbor (KNN) showed that KNN never outperformed P- NNS (for both JSON-Bag and baseline) while requiring more computations and parameter tuning. Random Forest (RF) is a simple, yet effective, predic- tive model for tabular data due to its implicit feature selection mechanism. A single decision tree (DT) chooses a feature to split at each level greedily based on how much the split improves model performance, which automatically excludes noisy and irrelevant features but can ignore useful features that are conditioned on other feature splits. Random Forests improve this by building smaller DTs using randomly sampled features and training data for each tree. We treat individual token-frequency pairs in JSON-Bag as features and use RF for the above classification tasks. Hand-crafted features: For every game, the features in- clude game duration and scores at game end. Scores of a player are recorded periodically throughout a game trajectory into a score vector s, a linear regression model is fitted to predict s;: w xXi+b=s;, where i is the index of the score. We extract w and 6 for each player as features. For individual games, we define a set of game-specific features to be aggregated from actions played and extracted from the final game state. Dots and boxes only uses the generic game features defined above. Connect4 does not use any score related features since it has no scoring, only win, lose, or draw at game end. The number of hand-crafted features used for each game is detailed in [Table TI] Full report on MCTS parameters, game parameters, and hand-crafted features is in the GitHub repo P| JSON-Bag is also evaluated with cosine similarity (JSON- Cosine) and Euclidean distance (JSON-L2). For these two methods, each token is instead normalized across bags so their minimum and maximum values are 0 and 1, respectively. Additionally, a special version of JSON-Bag where indi- vidual characters (e.g., 1, ’f’, ’}’, etc.) of a JSON string is tokenized, called JSON-Char, is evaluated on all games. *https://github.com/dienn 1/JSONBag 7 Wonders Dominion Sea Salt and Paper Can’t Stop Connect4 Dots and boxes Method Agent Param Seed | Agent Param Seed | Agent Param Seed | Agent Param Seed | Agent Param Hand-crafted 0.696 0.476 0.573 | 0.911 0.996 0.462 | 0.425 0.854 0.856 | 0.474 0.414 0.504 | 0.476 0.943 0.702 0.852 JSON-Bag 0.742 0.546 0.942 | 0.938 1.000 0.350 | 0.718 0.990 0.983 | 0.493 0.977 0.922 | 0.644 1.000 0.509 1.000 JSON-Char 0.433 0.358 0.883 | 0.930 1.000 0.334 | 0.525 0.865 0.345 | 0.528 0.552 0.540 | 0.403 0.947 0.472 0.994 JSON-L2 0.758 0.525 0.980 | 0.831 0.992 0.369 | 0.587 0.974 0.963 | 0.467 0.613 0.827 | 0.522 0.954 0.660 1.000 JSON-Cosine | 0.756 0.528 0.980 | 0.873 1.000 0.396 | 0.665 0.995 0.977 | 0.469 0.712 0.915 | 0.600 0.982 0.655 1.000 TABLE III P-NNS CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY.

JSON-Bag prototype distance and policy distance In our experiment, S is generated with random play, the policy distance for each pair of agents is calculated by The policies for Random and OSLA agents at any state are estimated by repeatedly sampling an action from them n times; we choose n = 100. Due to computational cost, we instead estimate the policies of MCTS agents by using softmax over the visit counts of the root node’s children. We plot the JSD between JSON-Bag prototypes of agent classes against their policy distance (Figure 3) and calculate the Pearson coefficient between them (Table VI). C. Preventing data leakage In certain tasks, the class labels are explicitly encoded in game object data. For example, fixing a game seed for 7 Won- ders also fixes the wonder board assignment of each player, so there is a direct mapping from game seed to the wonder board assignment. Therefore, for classifying 7 Wonders seed, any information related to the player wonder board is removed. Similarly, in Connect4, there is a variable in the grid board object explicitly storing its size. We do not serialize that variable for classifying Connect4 game parameters. VII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A. Prototype-based Nearest Neighbor Search [Table II]shows the classification accuracy of P-NNS. JSON- Bag outperforms hand-crafted features on most tasks. Both JSON and hand-crafted approaches can mostly distinguish OSLA and Random agents from other MCTS agents, even if they struggle to differentiate between the MCTS agents. For example, in Sea Salt and Paper, both approaches have difficulty separating the MCTS agents, but otherwise perform well on OSLA and Random (Figure I). Notably, JSON-Bag al- most perfectly differentiates the MCTS agents from OSLA and Random; this same pattern is observed for most games, except for Connect4 and Dots and boxes. For the former, it is possibly due to more complex interaction between tokens/features being required, since the pattern holds with RF; for the latter, our results suggest that MCTS64 is indistinguishable from OSLA in Dots and boxes (see subsection VII-E). Comparing accuracy of JSD, cosine similarity, and Eu- clidean distance, JSD mostly outperforms the others, but their overall performance is comparable. We prefer JSD for the reasons mentioned in Both methods perform poorly on classifying 7 Wonders game parameters and Dominion game seeds. The former can be explained by small parameter space: we only parameterized the cost of buying resources from neighbors and the defined range of possible values is small, so different sets of game parameters may not behave differently enough for the models to distinguish them. The latter may be due to the role of randomness in Dominion: the common card pool is fully-revealed and fixed for every game; the only stochastic element is in shuffling players’ draw deck, whose contents are small and known to everyone (except for the ordering). This agrees with results from Goodman et al. (25) that game seeds have the least effect on Dominion’s game outcome among all other tested stochastic games.

This suggests JSON-Bag is extracting information that the hand-crafted features do not have. On the other hand, using hand-crafted features significantly outperforms JSON-Bag in classifying Dots and boxes agents with just 8 features. Using only turn count as a feature already reaches an accuracy of 61%, compared to JSON-Bag’s 51%. The same information is also tokenized for JSON-Bag, but different turn counts are tokenized as completely different tokens, e.g. "turnCount.8", "turnCount.12". Instead, treating turnCount as atomic and adding their values to the occurrence count may be more informative. This suggests that further refining of the tokenization method to treat specific types of atomic value differently would improve JSON-Bag. It’s worth emphasizing the accuracy of JSON-Char, where the individual characters from JSON strings are tokenized. It is unexpected that JSON-Char would work at all, let alone achieve comparable accuracy or even outperform hand-crafted features in certain tasks. This demonstrates the potential of JSON format (or any data description format, especially human-readable ones) to be used as a medium for game anal- ysis. The “vocabulary” of JSON descriptions and its semantics are so limited and unambiguous (more so than in traditional NLP problems) that the frequency of individual characters is enough to characterise game trajectories. Applying more sophisticated NLP methods to JSON descriptions of game states is a promising direction for future research. B. Random Forest Table V| shows the classification accuracy of RF. JSON- Bag’s accuracy on certain tasks where it underperforms with Game Pearson-R 7 Wonders 0.8824 Dominion 0.773 Sea Salt and Paper 0.6235 Can’t Stop 0.9688 Connect4 0.6225 Dots and boxes 0.813 PEARSON COEFFICIENT CORRELATION BETWEEN JSON-BAG PROTOTYPE DISTANCE AND POLICY DISTANCE BETWEEN AGENT CLASSES P-NNS significantly improves with RF, namely: 7 Wonders game parameters, Dominion game seeds, Connect4 and Dots and boxes playing agents. This big jump in accuracy implies JSON-Bag can be used together with more sophisticated machine learning methods capable of learning more complex interactions between its tokens. If each token is considered a feature, then JSON-Bag automatically extracts features from game trajectories to be used as input for RF. This works particularly well with RF because of its implicit feature selection mechanism. We believe hand-crafted features will outperform JSON- Bag with more effort into feature selection and engineering. In fact, JSON-Bag can help feature selection. For example, the Mean Decrease in Impurity (MDI) of a fitted RF as feature importance can inform which features from JSON-Bag are most relevant and should be manually considered. Detailed feature analysis using JSON-Bag is a topic for future work. C. N-Shot Classification We test N-shot classification with P-NNS, where the training data has N samples for each class. [Table IV] shows P-NNS N- shot accuracy using JSON-Bag with JSD averaged over 20 trials. For “easy” tasks (where regular P-NNS JSON-Bag has more than 80% accuracy), N-shot P-NNS JSON-Bag can reach good accuracy with as few as 5 samples per class. This means P-NNS using JSON-Bag can efficiently differentiate classes that are “obviously” different from each other. The sample efficiency is especially useful where two classes of game trajectories need their distance evaluated online (i.e., no trajectories have been generated prior). For example, when searching for playing agents with diverse playstyles, determin- ing the novelty of new solutions requires many generated game trajectories to estimate game-specific metrics to be compared against existing agents (3). Instead, JSON-Bag and JSD would only need a few game trajectories to give a good estimate of how novel the new solution is. Its poor performance on more difficult tasks is arguably an acceptable downside, as it is likely those tasks involve classes that behave similarly. As shown in Figure 3} the policy distance between different agents is highly correlated to the JSD between their JSON-Bag prototypes. D. JSON-Bag prototype distance and policy distance plots the JSON-Bag prototype JSD against the policy distance between pairs of agents. |Table VI}detailed the Pearson correlation coefficient between them for each game, confirming that the two metrics are highly correlated.

JSON-Bag prototype distance vs. Policy Distance between agent classes. Each point is a pair of agents. without the need for hand-crafted features and game-specific metrics. Due to computational constraints, the states S are generated with random play. However, directly using policies of the two agents being evaluated instead may yield a policy distance that better reflects their actual behavioral difference. E. Dots and boxes MCTS64 vs. OSLA Dots and boxes tuned MCTS64 agent is an open-loop MCTS agent with maximum tree depth of 3, using progressive widening and MultiTree [27]. However, it is completely indistinguishable from a simple OSLA agent for both JSON- Bag and hand-crafted features (Figure 2). Looking at Dots and boxes pairs of agents in re can see the pair with the lowest JSON-Bag Prototype JSD, MCTS64-OSLA, also corresponds to the lowest policy distance of all the pairs. This confirms that RF and P-NNS struggle to distinguish them because of similar behavior. A quick experiment of 200 games playing OSLA and MCTS64 against each other on Dots and boxes showed that both achieve approximately 50% win rate. F. Limitations As shown with Dots and Boxes, JSON-Bag may not func- tion well in “sparse” games, where the information serialized from game state data is not as informative due to few unique game components, or games heavily dependent on spatial relations between components (e.g., grids). Further refinement to tokenization may improve this issue. For instance, exploring ways in which game components with a large range of values (e.g., turn count) could be represented to prevent all possible values from being considered as different tokens. For grid- based games, x and y coordinates of game elements can be tokenized in pairs instead (e.g., "x.6.y.9" instead of individual "x.6" and "y.9"). VIII. CONCLUSION We propose JSON Bag-of-Tokens model (JSON-Bag), a method to generically represent game trajectories by tok- enizing the JSON descriptions of individual game states. We describe a domain-agnostic method of tokenizing JSON, with potential for further domain-specific refinement. A JSON-Bag is interpreted as a probabilistic model for game trajectories, which allows the use of Jensen-Shannon distance (JSD) metric to compare game trajectories. We evaluate the validity of our approach through various tasks. First, six tabletop games are used as test bed—7 Wonders, Dominion, Sea Salt and Paper, Can’t Stop, Connect4, Dots and boxes—each with three game trajectory classification tasks: classifying the playing agents, game parameters, or game seeds that generated the trajectories. Using prototype-based nearest neighbor search (P-NNS), JSON-Bag outperforms a baseline of hand-crafted features on the majority of tasks. Second, we show that JSON-Bag prototype is a sample efficient representation for game trajectory classes through ex- periments with N-shot classification. This is especially useful when similarity between classes of game trajectories needs to be evaluated “online”. For example, when novelty of a new solution needs to be evaluated in novelty search, domain- specific metrics may need many simulation trajectories for reliable estimates (3). while JSON-Bag only needs a few. Third, we demonstrate JSON-Bag’s ability for automatic feature extraction by treating individual tokens-frequency pairs as features to use with Random Forest (RF), which sig- nificantly improves accuracy on tasks P-NNS underperform. Using JSON-Bag together with more sophisticated feature selection methods is an interesting direction of future research to aid in understanding game-specific features. Finally, we show that the JSD between JSON-Bag pro- totypes of different agents highly correlates with behavioral difference measured by policy distance, validating JSON-Bag and JSD for playstyle clustering without hand-crafted features. However, JSON-Bag can struggle with “sparse” games, where serialized game state data is not as informative due to few unique game components, or games heavily dependent on spatial relations (e.g., grids), such as Dots and Boxes. Further refinement to tokenization may help address these limitations. Immediate future work should focus on testing JSON- Bag on more games, different JSON representations, and on more complex tasks to fully understand the limitations of this approach. The types of games to be tested on should be extended beyond turn-based tabletop games. Other NLP methods are also promising alternative ap- proaches to JSON processing. We initially used Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) to measure the distance between raw JSON string of game trajectories. Despite recent success in topic modeling [29], NCD behaves inconsistently in the above tasks, and sometimes fails without a clear reason we can discern. Possible future work would be to analyze how to get NCD working and/or why it fails in this domain.

arXiv:2508.00709v1 [cs.CL] 1 Aug 2025 NyayaRAG: Realistic Legal Judgment Prediction with RAG under the Indian Common Law System Shubham Kumar Nigam‘** Ajay Varghese Thomas* Noel Shallum? 1 TIT Kanpur, India 3 TISER Kolkata, India Balaramamahanthi Deepak Patnaik’ Shivam Mishra‘* Kripabandhu Ghosh* 2 SRM Institute of Science and Technology, India 4 Symbiosis Law School Pune, India Arnab Bhattacharya‘ {sknigam, deepak, shivammishra, arnabb}@cse.iitk.ac.in [EMAIL].in Abstract Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) has emerged as a key area in AI for law, aiming to automate judicial outcome forecasting and enhance inter- pretability in legal reasoning. While previous approaches in the Indian context have relied on internal case content such as facts, issues, and reasoning, they often overlook a core element of common law systems, which is reliance on statutory provisions and judicial precedents. In this work, we propose NyayaRAG, a Retrieval- Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that simulates realistic courtroom scenarios by pro- viding models with factual case descriptions, relevant legal statutes, and semantically re- trieved prior cases. NyayaRAG evaluates the effectiveness of these combined inputs in pre- dicting court decisions and generating legal ex- planations using a domain-specific pipeline tai- lored to the Indian legal system. We assess per- formance across various input configurations using both standard lexical and semantic met- rics as well as LLM-based evaluators such as G- Eval. Our results show that augmenting factual inputs with structured legal knowledge signifi- cantly improves both predictive accuracy and explanation quality. 1 Introduction The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in le- gal judgment prediction (LJP) has the potential to transform legal systems by improving efficiency, transparency, and access to justice. This is partic- ularly crucial for India, where millions of cases remain pending in courts, and decision-making is inherently dependent on factual narratives, statu- tory interpretation, and judicial precedent. India follows a common law system, where prior deci- sions (precedents) and statutory provisions play a central role in influencing legal outcomes. How- ever, most existing AI-based LJP systems do not *These authors contributed equally to this work ' Corresponding author [EMAIL].in, [EMAIL] adequately replicate this fundamental feature of judicial reasoning. Previous studies such as Malik et al. (2021); Nigam et al. (2024b, 2025a) have focused on pre- dicting legal outcomes using the current case docu- ment, including sections like facts, arguments, is- sues, reasoning, and decision. More recent efforts have narrowed the scope to factual inputs alone (Nigam et al., 2024a, 2025b), yet these systems still operate in a vacuum, without considering how courts naturally rely on applicable laws and prior rulings. In reality, judges rarely decide in isolation; instead, they actively refer to relevant precedent and statutory law. To bridge this gap, we propose a framework that more closely mirrors actual court- room conditions by explicitly incorporating exter- nal legal knowledge during inference. Moreover, in critical domains like finance, medicine, and law, decisions must be grounded in verifiable information. Experts in these domains cannot rely on opaque, black-box inferences, and they require systems that ensure factual consistency. Hallucinations, common in large generative mod- els, can have severe consequences in legal decision- making. By retrieving and conditioning model re- sponses on grounded sources such as applicable laws and precedent cases, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a principled approach to mitigate hallucination and promote trustworthy out- puts. Furthermore, RAG frameworks like ours can be flexibly integrated into existing legal systems without requiring the retraining of core models or the sharing of private or sensitive case data. This enhances user trust while allowing the legal com- munity to benefit from AI without sacrificing trans- parency or data confidentiality. We introduce NyayaRAG, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for realistic legal judgment prediction and explanation in the Indian common law system. The term “NyayaRAG” is derived from two components: “Nyaya” mean- ing “justice” and “RAG” referring to “Retrieval- Augmented Generation”. Together, the name re- flects our vision to build a justice-aware genera- tion system that emulates the reasoning process followed by Indian courts, using facts, statutes, and precedents. Unlike prior models that operate purely on in- ternal case content, NyayaRAG simulates real-world judicial decision-making by providing the model with: (i) the summarized factual background of the current case, (ii) relevant statutory provisions, (iii) top-k semantically retrieved previous similar judg- ments. This structure emulates how judges deliber- ate on new cases, consulting both textual statutes and prior judicial opinions. Through this design, we evaluate how Retrieval-Augmented Generation can help reduce hallucinations, promote faithful- ness, and yield legally coherent predictions and explanations. Our contributions are as follows: 1. A Realistic RAG Framework for Indian Courts: We present NyayaRAG, a novel framework that emulates Indian common law decision-making by incorporating not only facts but also retrieved legal statutes and precedents. 2. Retrieval-Augmented Pipelines with Structured Inputs: We construct modular pipelines repre- senting different combinations of factual, statu- tory, and precedent-based inputs to understand their individual and combined contributions to model performance. 3. Simulating Common Law Reasoning with LLMs: We show that LLMs guided by RAG and factual grounding can produce legally faithful explana- tions aligned with how real-world decisions are made under common law reasoning. Our work moves beyond fact-only or self- contained models by replicating a more faithful le- gal reasoning pipeline aligned with Indian jurispru- dence. We hope that NyayaRAG opens new direc- tions for building interpretable, retrieval-aware AI systems in legal settings, particularly in resource- constrained yet precedent-driven judicial systems like India’s. For the sake of reproducibility, we have made our dataset, code, and RAG-based pipeline implementation via a GitHub repository!. 2 Related Work Recent advancements in natural language process- ing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs) have https://github.com/ShubhamKumarNigam/RAGLegal significantly improved the performance of ques- tion answering (QA) and legal decision support systems. Transformer-based architectures such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), GPT (Radford et al., 2019), and their instruction-tuned successors have led to robust capabilities in knowledge-intensive and multi-hop reasoning tasks. The integration of external information via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a particularly ef- fective approach for enhancing generation fidelity and reducing hallucinations (Han et al., 2024; Hei et al., 2024). Within the legal domain, Legal Judgment Pre- diction (LJP) has seen significant progress, with models trained to infer outcomes based on factual and procedural components of court cases (Strick- son and De La Iglesia, 2020; Xu et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2023). In the Indian legal context, the ILDC corpus (Malik et al., 2021) and its extended vari- ants (Nigam et al., 2024b; Nigam and Deroy, 2023) have enabled the development of supervised and instruction-tuned models for both judgment predic- tion and explanation. The emergence of domain- specific datasets and architectures has allowed LJP systems to move from simple binary classification to more complex reasoning tasks aligned with real judicial behavior (Vats et al., 2023). Parallel to these developments, there has been a sharp rise in interest in RAG techniques for legal NLP. Several benchmark and system-level contribu- tions have explored how retrieval-enhanced gener- ation can be leveraged to assist legal professionals, improve legal QA systems, and support document analysis. Notably, LegalBench-RAG (Pipitone and Alami, 2024) introduced a benchmark suite for eval- uating RAG in the legal domain. Survey papers like (Hindi et al., 2025) provide comprehensive overviews of techniques aimed at improving RAG performance, factual grounding, and interpretabil- ity in legal settings. Several system-level contributions have demon- strated the power of RAG in specialized applica- tions. Graph-RAG for Legal Norms (de Martim, 2025) and Bridging Legal Knowledge and AI (Bar- ron et al., 2025) proposed methods to integrate structured legal knowledge such as statutes and normative hierarchies into the retrieval pipeline. Similarly, CBR-RAG (Wiratunga et al., 2024) ap- plied case-based reasoning to leverage historical decisions, showing strong gains in legal question answering.

Further domain-specific applications include Al-powered legal assistants like Legal Query RAG (Wahidur et al., 2025) and RAG-based so- lutions for dispute resolution in housing law (Rafat, 2024). Optimizing Legal Information Access (Am- ato et al., 2024) showcased federated RAG architec- tures for secure document retrieval, and Augment- ing Legal Judgment Prediction with Contrastive Case Relations (Liu et al., 2022) illustrated the benefits of encoding contrastive precedents for pre- dictive reasoning. 3 Task Description India’s judicial system operates within the com- mon law framework, where judges deliberate cases based on three fundamental pillars: (i) the fac- tual context of the case, (ii) applicable statutory provisions, and (iii) relevant judicial precedents. Our task is designed to simulate such realistic legal decision-making by leveraging Retrieval- Augmented Generation (RAG), enabling models to access external legal knowledge during inference. Figure 1 illustrates our Legal Judgment Pre- diction (LJP) pipeline enhanced with RAG. The pipeline begins with a full legal judgment doc- ument, which undergoes summarization to re- duce its length and retain essential factual mean- ing. This is necessary because legal judgments tend to be long, and appending retrieved knowI- edge further increases the input size. Given limited model capacity and computational re- sources, we employ a summarization step (using Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-vQ.1) to create a con- densed representation of both the input case and the retrieved legal context. Prediction Task: Based on the summarized fac- tual description D and the retrieved top-k (e.g., k; = 3) similar legal documents (statutes or prece- dents), the model predicts the likely court judgment. The prediction label y € {0, 1} indicates whether the appeal is fully rejected (0) or fully/partially ac- cepted (1). This binary framing captures the most common forms of judicial decisions in Indian ap- pellate courts. Explanation Task: Alongside the decision, the model is also required to generate an explanation that justifies its output. This explanation should log- ically incorporate the facts, cited statutes, and rele- vant precedents retrieved during the RAG process. This step emulates how judges provide reasoned opinions in written judgments. By structuring the LJP task in this way, sum- marizing long documents and integrating retrieval- based augmentation, we study the effectiveness of RAG agents in producing judgments that are both faithful to legal reasoning and grounded in prece- dent and statute. The overall framework allows us to approximate a real-world decision-making environment within Indian courtrooms. 4 Dataset Our dataset is designed to simulate realistic court decision-making in the Indian legal context, incor- porating facts, statutes, and precedent, essential elements under the common law framework.

The web- site provides structural tags for various judgment components (e.g., facts, issues, arguments), which allowed for clean and structured scraping. These documents serve as the foundation for our summa- rization, retrieval, and reasoning experiments. 4.2 Dataset Composition The corpus supports multiple downstream pipelines, each focusing on specific judgment elements or legal context. Table 1 presents key statistics across different configurations, and an example breakdown is shown in the Appendix Table 7. 4.2.1 Case Text Each judgment includes complete narrative con- tent such as factual background, party argu- ments, legal issues, reasoning, and verdict. Due to length constraints exceeding model context windows, we summarized these documents us- ing Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 (Jiang et al., 2024), which supports up to 32k tokens. The summarization preserved critical legal elements through carefully designed prompts (see Table 2). 4.2.2 Precedents From each judgment, cited precedents were ex- tracted using metadata tags provided by Indi- anKanoon. These citations represent explicit legal reasoning and are retained for use during inference to replicate how courts consider prior judgments. 4.2.3 Statutes Statutory references were also programmatically extracted, including citations to laws like the Indian Penal Code and the Constitution of India. Where https ://indiankanoon.org/ statute sections exceeded length limits, they were summarized using the same LLM pipeline. Only statutes directly cited in the respective cases were retained, ensuring relevance. 4.2.4 Previous Similar Cases To simulate implicit precedent-based reasoning, we employed semantic similarity retrieval to identify relevant previous cases beyond explicit citations: ¢ Corpus Vectorization: All 56,387 documents were embedded into dense vector representations using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 sentence trans- former. ¢ Target Encoding: The 5,000 selected training samples were vectorized similarly. * Top-k Retrieval: Using ChromabDB, we retrieved the top-3 most semantically similar cases for each document based on cosine similarity. ¢ Augmentation: Retrieved cases were appended to the factual input to form the “casetext + previous similar cases” input during model inference. This retrieval step enriches context with prece- dents that are semantically close, even if not cited, enhancing the legal realism of our setup. 4.2.5 Facts We separately extracted the factual portions of all 56,387 judgments. These include background infor- mation, chronological events, and party narratives, excluding legal reasoning. These fact-only subsets were used to simulate realistic courtroom scenarios where judges primarily rely on facts, relevant law, and precedent for decision-making. Overall, our dataset is uniquely structured to test legal decision-making under realistic constraints, aligning with the Indian legal system’s reliance on factual narratives, statutory frameworks, and prior rulings. 5 Methodology To simulate realistic judgment prediction and eval- uate the role of RAG in enhancing legal decision- making, we design a modular experimental setup. This setup explores how different types of legal information, such as factual summaries, statutes, and precedents, affect model performance on the dual tasks of prediction and explanation. To en- sure reproducibility and transparency, we detail the full experimental setup, including model configu- rations, training routines, and task-specific hyper- parameters, in Appendix A. This includes separate Summarization Prompt The text is regarding a court judgment for a specific case. Summarize it into 1000 tokens but more than 700 tokens. The summarization should highlight the Facts, Issues, Statutes, Ratio of the decision, Ruling by Present Court (Decision), and a Conclusion.

Each pipeline configu- ration represents a distinct input scenario reflecting different degrees of legal context and retrieval aug- mentation. These pipelines are as follows: ¢ CaseText Only: Includes only the summarized version of the full case judgment, which contains factual background, arguments, and reasoning. ¢ CaseText + Statutes: Appends summarized statutory references cited in the judgment to the case text, simulating scenarios where relevant laws are explicitly considered. CaseText + Precedents: Incorporates prior cited judgments mentioned in the original case, repre- senting explicitly relied-upon precedents. CaseText + Previous Similar Cases: Adds top- 3 semantically similar past judgments (retrieved via ChromaDB using all-MiniLM-L6-v2 em- beddings), allowing the model to learn from precedents not explicitly cited. CaseText + Statutes + Precedents: A compre- hensive legal input pipeline combining the full judgment summary, statutes, and cited prior judg- ments. Facts Only: A minimal pipeline containing only the factual summary, excluding all legal reason- ing and verdicts. This setup evaluates whether a model can infer judgments from facts alone. Facts + Statutes + Precedents: Combines fac- tual input with statutory and precedent context to simulate realistic courtroom conditions where judges rely on facts, applicable law, and relevant past cases. This modular design enables granular control over input features and facilitates direct compari- son of how each knowledge source contributes to judgment prediction and explanation generation. 5.2. Prompt Design To ensure consistency and interpretability across all pipelines, we used fixed instruction prompts with minor variations depending on the available contextual inputs (e.g., facts only vs. facts + law + precedent). These prompts guide the model in producing both binary predictions and natural lan- guage explanations. Prompts were structured to reflect real judicial inquiry formats, aligning with the instruction-following capabilities of modern LLMs. Full prompt templates are listed in Ap- pendix Table 8, along with prediction examples. 5.3 Inference Setup We use the LLaMA-3.1 8B Instruct (Dubey et al., 2024) model for all experiments in a few-shot prompting setup. Each input sequence, composed according to one of the pipeline templates, is paired with a relevant prompt. The model is required to output: ¢ A binary judgment prediction: 0 (appeal rejected) or 1 (appeal fully/partially accepted) ¢ A justification: a coherent explanation based on legal facts, statutes, and precedent The model is explicitly instructed to reason with the provided information and emulate judicial writ- ing. Retrieved knowledge (via RAG) is included in-context to enhance legal reasoning while mini- mizing hallucinations. This experimental design allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of legal retrieval and summariza- tion under realistic judicial decision-making con- straints in the Indian common law setting. 6 Evaluation Metrics To evaluate the effectiveness of our Retrieval- Augmented Legal Judgment Prediction framework, we adopt a comprehensive set of metrics covering both classification accuracy and explanation qual- ity. The evaluation is conducted on two fronts: the judgment prediction task and the explanation gen- eration task. These metrics are selected to ensure a holistic assessment of model performance in the Pipeline Name Partition Accuracy Precision Recall F1-score Single 62.27 33.50 30.88 29.45 CaseText Only Multi 53.10 25.26 [PHONE] Case Text + Statut Single 67.07 45.29 4455 44.32 AseheNt + statutes Multi 60.36 64.22 64.04 60.35 ; Single 61.73 [PHONE] 40.81 CaseText + Precedents Multi 57.53 6134 61.19 57.53 Co Single 57.53 61.34 61.19 57.53 CaseText + Previous Similar Cases Multi 61.73 41.92 4135 57.53 Single 64.71 43.50 42.98 42.78 CaseText + Statutes + Precedents Multi 65.86 63.94 63.99 63.96 CaseFacts Only Single 51.13 5136 51.30 50.68 Multi 53.71 51.18 51.18 51.18 Single 50.58 33.57 33.56 33.24 Facts + Statutes + Precedents Multi 52.57 52.01 52.01 52.01 Table 3: Performance of Various Pipelines on Binary and Multi-label Legal Judgment Prediction. The best result has been marked in bold. legal domain. We report Macro Precision, Macro Recall, Macro F1, and Accuracy for judgment pre- diction, and we use both quantitative and qualita- tive methods to evaluate the quality of explanations generated by the model. 1. Lexical-based Evaluation: We utilized stan- dard lexical similarity metrics, including Rouge- L (Lin, 2004), BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), and METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005). These metrics measure the overlap and order of words between the generated explanations and the ref- erence texts, providing a quantitative assessment of the lexical accuracy of the model outputs. 2. Semantic Similarity-based Evaluation: To capture the semantic quality of the generated explanations, we employed BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020), which measures the semantic simi- larity between the generated text and the ref- erence explanations. Additionally, we used BLANC (Vasilyev et al., 2020), a metric that estimates the quality of generated text without a gold standard, to evaluate the model’s ability to produce semantically meaningful and contextu- ally relevant explanations. 3. LLM-based Evaluation (LLM-as-a-Judge): To complement traditional metrics, we incorpo- rate an automatic evaluation strategy that uses large language models themselves as evaluators, commonly referred to as LLM-as-a-Judge. This evaluation is crucial for assessing structured ar- gumentation and legal correctness in a format aligned with expert judicial reasoning. We adopt G-Eval (Liu et al., 2023), a GPT-4-based eval- uation framework tailored for natural language generation tasks. G-Eval leverages chain-of- thought prompting and structured scoring to as- sess explanations along three key criteria: fac- tual accuracy, completeness & coverage, and clarity & coherence. Each generated legal ex- planation is scored on a scale from | to 10 based on how well it aligns with the expected content and a reference document. The exact prompt format used for evaluation is shown in Appendix Table 9. For our experiments, we use the GPT- 4o0-mini model to generate reliable scores with- out manual intervention. This setup provides an interpretable, unified judgment metric that captures legal soundness, completeness of rea- soning, and logical coherence, beyond what tra- ditional similarity-based metrics can offer. 4. Expert Evaluation: To validate the inter- pretability and legal soundness of the model- generated explanations, we conduct an expert evaluation involving legal professionals. They rate a representative subset of the generated out- puts on a 1-10 Likert scale across three criteria: factual accuracy, legal relevance, and complete- ness of reasoning. A score of 1 denotes a poor or misleading explanation, while a 10 reflects high legal fidelity and argumentative soundness. This evaluation provides critical insights beyond automated metrics. 5. Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA): To ensure the reliability and consistency of expert judg- ments, we compute standard JAA statistics, in- cluding Fleiss’ Kappa, Cohen’s Kappa, Krippen- dorff’s Alpha, Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), and Pearson Correlation. These metrics quantify the degree of agreement across expert raters, reinforcing the credibility of the expert evaluation framework. Full details and scores are available in Appendix B. 7 Results and Analysis We conducted extensive evaluations across mul- tiple pipeline configurations to study the impact of different legal information components on both judgment prediction and explanation quality. Ta- bles 3 and 4 summarize the model’s performance across these configurations for binary and multi- label settings. 7.1 Judgment Prediction Performance As shown in Table 3, the pipeline combining Case- Text + Statutes achieved the highest accuracy in the single-label setting. This suggests that legal statutes provide substantial contextual cues for the model to infer the likely decision.

Interestingly, the CaseText + Previous Sim- ilar Cases pipeline showed the highest precision, recall, and Fl-score in the single-label case, indicat- ing that semantically retrieved precedents, despite not being explicitly cited, help the model align with actual judicial outcomes. In the multi-label setting, the best accuracy was observed for the CaseText + Statutes + Precedents pipeline. This comprehensive context provides the model with structured legal knowledge, im- proving generalization across different outcome labels. Conversely, the Facts Only pipeline per- formed worst overall, reaffirming that factual nar- ratives alone, without legal context, are insufficient for reliably predicting legal outcomes. The poor performance of the Facts + Statutes + Precedents pipeline in the single-label setting suggests that factual sections might lack the interpretive cues that full case texts offer when combined with legal references. 7.2 Explanation Generation Quality Table 4 presents the results of explanation evalua- tion using a diverse set of metrics, including both automatic lexical and semantic metrics (ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, BERTScore, BLANC) and a large language model-based evaluation (G-Eval). Across both single and multi-label setups, the Case- Text + Statutes pipeline consistently outperformed all other configurations. In the single-label setting, it achieved the highest scores across key dimen- sions, substantially outperforming the CaseText Only baseline. This result underscores the criti- cal role of statutory references in enhancing both the factual alignment and interpretability of model- generated legal explanations. Interestingly, while the CaseText + Previous Sim- ilar Cases pipeline yielded strong lexical overlap (e.g., top ROUGE-L in the unabridged version), it lagged behind the statute-enhanced pipeline in metrics that assess semantic and contextual align- ment, such as G-Eval and BLANC. This indicates that while similar cases might help the model repli- cate surface-level language, they may not consis- tently offer legally grounded or complete reason- ing. Meanwhile, the CaseText + Statutes + Prece- dents pipeline also performed competitively, sug- gesting that combining structured legal references with precedent data can lead to balanced and high- quality explanations. In contrast, configurations that relied solely on factual narratives (CaseFacts Only and Facts + Statutes + Precedents) exhibited comparatively poor performance across all evaluation metrics. For example, the Facts + Statutes + Precedents pipeline recorded a G-Eval score as low in the single-label setting. This reinforces the notion that factual descriptions, while essential, are insufficient for constructing legally persuasive rationales. The absence of structured legal arguments, statutory alignment, or precedent citation in these setups ap- pears to undermine their explanatory effectiveness. Expert Evaluation: To complement automatic evaluations, we also conducted a small-scale expert evaluation involving experienced legal profession- als. Each expert independently rated a subset of model-generated explanations based on factual ac- curacy, legal relevance, and completeness using a 10-point Likert scale. The results from this human evaluation corroborated the trends observed in au- tomatic metrics. Notably, the CaseText + Statutes pipeline received the highest expert score among all configurations, reinforcing the positive impact of statutory knowledge on explanation quality. In contrast, fact-only pipelines again received the low- est expert ratings, echoing concerns about their insufficient legal reasoning depth. To ensure the reliability of expert scores, we conducted a detailed Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) analysis across multiple evaluation dimen- sions. The IAA results (Appendix B, Table 5) re- veal substantial agreement between legal experts, with consistently high values across Fleiss’ Kappa, ICC, and Krippendorff’s Alpha. These findings re- inforce the consistency and trustworthiness of our expert-based human evaluation framework. Overall, the results emphasize the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) when paired with structured legal content, especially statutes, in producing accurate, interpretable, and legally coherent explanations. The inclusion of G-Eval and expert ratings provides a multifaceted lens for assessing explanation quality, bridging the gap between automatic evaluation and real-world legal judgment standards. 8 Ablation Study: Understanding the Role of Legal Context Components To assess the individual contribution of each le- gal context component, factual narratives, statutory provisions, cited precedents, and semantically simi- lar past cases, we perform an ablation study by sys- tematically removing or altering these inputs across pipeline configurations. This study highlights how each component affects prediction accuracy and explanation quality, as reported in Tables 3 and 4. Impact on Judgment Prediction: The CaseText + Statutes + Precedents pipeline serves as the most comprehensive baseline. Removing statutory references (i.e., CaseText + Precedents) leads to a noticeable drop in Fl-score (from 63.96 to 57.53 in the multi-label setting), indicating that legal provisions provide structured grounding essential for accurate predictions. Similarly, eliminating precedents (i.e., CaseText + Statutes) also reduces performance, though the drop is less steep, suggesting complementary roles of statutes and precedents. Pipelines relying solely on factual case narratives (e.g., CaseFacts Only) perform the worst, reaffirming that factual information alone is insufficient for robust legal outcome prediction. Impact on Explanation Quality: A similar pat- tern emerges in explanation generation. The CaseText + Statutes pipeline consistently out- performs others across ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, BERTScore, and G-Eval metrics, underscoring the importance of grounding explanations in ex- plicit statutory language. When only precedents are added (without statutes), as in CaseText + Precedents, explanation scores drop significantly (e.g., G-Eval: 4.21 to 3.45 in the single-label case). The worst-performing setup is Facts + Statutes + Precedents, highlighting that factual inputs, even when supplemented with legal references, do not suffice for generating coherent and persuasive explanations if the core case context is missing. Insights: These findings validate the design choices in NyayaRAG, where integrating factual case text with statutory and precedential know!- edge mimics real-world judicial reasoning. Statu- tory references provide normative structure, while precedents offer context-specific analogies. Their absence not only reduces predictive performance but also degrades the factuality, clarity, and legal coherence of the generated explanations. This ablation analysis also offers practical guid- ance: for retrieval-augmented systems deployed in legal contexts, careful curation and combination of retrieved statutes and relevant precedents are critical to ensure trustworthy outputs. 9 Conclusion and Future Scope This paper introduced NyayaRAG, a Retrieval- Augmented Generation framework tailored for re- alistic legal judgment prediction and explanation in the Indian common law system. By combining factual case details with retrieved statutory provi- sions and relevant precedents, our approach mirrors judicial reasoning more closely than prior meth- ods that rely solely on the case text. Empirical results across prediction and explanation tasks con- firm that structured legal retrieval enhances both outcome accuracy and interpretability. Pipelines enriched with statutes and precedents consistently outperformed baselines, as validated by lexical, se- mantic, and LLM-based (G-Eval) metrics, as well as expert feedback. Future directions include extending to hierar- chical verdict structures, integrating symbolic or graph-based retrieval, modeling temporal prece- dent evolution, and leveraging human-in-the-loop mechanisms. NyayaRAG marks a step toward court- aligned, explainable legal AI and sets the founda- tion for future research in retrieval-enhanced legal systems within underrepresented jurisdictions. Limitations While NyayaRAG marks a significant advance in realistic legal judgment prediction under the Indian common law framework, several limitations merit further attention. First, although Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps reduce hallucinations by grounding outputs in retrieved legal documents, it does not fully eliminate factual or interpretive inaccuracies. In sensitive domains such as law, even rare errors in reasoning or justification may raise concerns about reliability and accountability. Second, the current framework supports binary and multi-label outcome structures but does not yet handle the full spectrum of legal verdicts, such as hierarchical or multi-class decisions involving com- plex legal provisions. Expanding to richer verdict taxonomies would enable broader applicability and deeper case understanding. Third, NyayaRAG assumes the availability of clean, well-structured legal documents and relies on summarization pipelines to manage input length. However, real-world legal texts often contain noise, OCR errors, or inconsistent formatting. Although summarization aids conciseness, it may inadver- tently omit subtle legal nuances that affect judg- ment outcomes or explanation quality. Finally, due to computational resource con- straints, the current system utilizes instruction- tuned LLMs guided by domain-specific prompts rather than fully fine-tuning on large-scale Indian legal corpora. While prompt-based tuning remains efficient and modular, fine-tuning on in-domain le- gal texts could further enhance model fidelity and domain alignment. Despite these limitations, NyayaRAG provides a robust and interpretable foundation for judgment prediction and explanation, supported by both auto- matic and expert evaluations. Future work that ad- dresses these constraints, particularly hierarchical decision modeling and domain-specific fine-tuning, will further strengthen the framework’s legal rele- vance and practical deployment potential. Ethics Statement This research adheres to established ethical stan- dards for conducting work in high-stakes domains such as law. The legal documents used in our study were sourced from IndianKanoon (https: // indiankanoon.org/), a publicly available repos- itory of Indian court judgments. All documents are in the public domain and do not include sealed cases or personally identifiable sensitive informa- tion, ensuring that our use of the data complies with privacy and confidentiality norms. We emphasize that the proposed NyayaRAG sys- tem is developed strictly for academic research purposes to simulate realistic legal reasoning pro- cesses. It is not intended for direct deployment in real-world legal settings. The model outputs must not be construed as legal advice, official court pre- dictions, or determinants of legal outcomes. Any downstream use should be performed with over- sight by qualified legal professionals. We strongly discourage the use of this system in live legal cases, policymaking, or decisions that may affect individ- uals’ rights without appropriate human-in-the-loop supervision. As part of our evaluation protocol, we in- volved domain experts (legal professionals and re- searchers) to assess the quality and legal coherence of the generated explanations. The evaluation was conducted on a curated subset of samples, and all participating experts were informed of the research objectives and voluntarily participated without any coercion or conflict of interest. No personal data was collected during this process, and all expert feedback was anonymized for analysis. While we strive to enhance legal interpretabil- ity and transparency, we acknowledge that legal documents themselves may reflect systemic biases. Our framework, while replicating judicial reason- ing patterns, may inherit such biases from training data. We do not deliberately introduce or amplify such biases, but we recognize the importance of fur- ther work in fairness auditing, particularly across litigant identity, socio-demographic markers, and jurisdictional diversity.

A Experimental Setup and Hyper-parameters A.1 Summarization Hyper-parameters To condense lengthy Indian Supreme Court judg- ments into structured and model-friendly inputs, we employed Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v@.1, a mixture-of-experts, instruction-tuned language model developed by Mistral AI. The summariza- tion was conducted in a zero-shot setting using tailored legal prompts that extracted key elements such as facts, statutes, precedents, reasoning, and the final ruling. The model was accessed via the HuggingFace Transformers interface and run on an NVIDIA A100 GPU with 80GB VRAM. Inputs were trun- cated to a maximum of 27,000 tokens to com- ply with the model’s context window. The output length was constrained to between 700 and 1,000 tokens to ensure consistency and legal complete- ness. A low decoding temperature of 0.2 was used to encourage determinism and factual alignment. These summaries served as inputs to the Retrieval- Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines used for downstream judgment prediction and explanation. A.2. Judgment Prediction Hyper-parameters For the legal judgment prediction task, we used the LLaMA 3-8B Instruct model, which supports high-quality reasoning in instruction-following set- tings. The model was applied in a few-shot prompt- ing setup without any task-specific fine-tuning. In- put prompts consisted of structured summaries (produced by Mixtral) along with retrieved statutes and prior similar cases. These inputs followed a consistent legal instruction format to guide the model’s prediction and explanation generation. Inference was performed using the PyTorch backend with HuggingFace Transformers on an NVIDIA A100 GPU (80GB). The model was loaded using device_map=“auto” for automatic device allocation. We used deterministic genera- tion parameters (temperature = 0.2, top-p = 0.9) and controlled output format to ensure faithful and interpretable outputs. Each output consisted of a binary prediction (@ for appeal rejected, 1 for appeal accepted/partially accepted) followed by a free-text legal explanation. No supervised fine- tuning was used, which allows our framework to be easily adapted to different legal datasets without retraining. B_Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) for Expert Evaluation B.1 IAA Metrics and Methodology To ensure the reliability and consistency of expert ratings on the quality of generated legal explana- tions, we computed five widely accepted inter-rater agreement metrics: ¢ Fleiss’ Kappa (Fleiss, 1971): Evaluates agree- ment among multiple raters for categorical judg- ments, adjusting for chance. Cohen’s Kappa (Cohen, 1960): Measures the pairwise agreement between two annotators, con- trolling for expected chance agreement. Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) (Shrout and Fleiss, 1979): Assesses the degree of consistency in continuous ratings across multiple raters. Krippendorff’s Alpha (Krippendorff, 2018): A versatile metric capable of handling varying scales and missing data, suitable for ordinal and interval data. Pearson Correlation Coefficient (Benesty et al., 2009): Quantifies the strength of the linear rela- tionship between expert rating scores. Three experienced legal experts independently rated a shared subset of model-generated legal ex- planations on a 10-point Likert scale, considering factual accuracy, legal relevance, and complete- ness. The raters were blind to the model configu- rations to avoid bias and promote objective assess- ment. B.2_ IAA Findings and Observations Interpretation: The overall inter-annotator agreement across all evaluation settings demon- strates moderate to substantial reliability. In the Single partition, pipelines such as CaseText + Statutes and CaseText + Statutes + Precedents achieved the highest agreement scores across most metrics (e.g., Fleiss’ & > 0.49, ICC almost 0.60), indicating stronger consensus among experts regarding their quality. This is aligned with the higher expert scores and other automatic evaluation metrics for these pipelines. In contrast, pipelines using only factual input or combining facts with retrieved statutes and prece- dents (CaseFacts Only and Facts + Statutes + Precedents) yielded relatively lower agreement scores (e.g., Fleiss’ & < 0.35, ICC < 0.50), re- flecting the increased ambiguity or inconsistency in explanation quality when limited or noisy con- textual information is used. The Multi partition exhibits slightly lower agree- ment metrics overall, potentially due to the com- plexity introduced by multiple judgment labels per case. Still, pipelines with richer legal con- text (CaseText + Statutes, CaseText + Statutes + Precedents) maintained comparatively higher con- sistency among annotators. Conclusion: These results reinforce the inter- pretability and credibility of our expert evaluation process. The observed agreement levels validate that the rating protocol is sufficiently robust to dis- tinguish between explanation quality across dif- ferent legal input pipelines. Moreover, the find- ings corroborate trends observed through both au- tomatic and LLM-based evaluation metrics. Pipelines Fleiss’ « Cohen’sx ICC Kripp.a _ Pearson Corr.

Pipeline Decision and Explanation Ground Truth Decision: Rejected. Explanation: 1. The parties to these appeals belong to Chokkura Thaliyadath tarwad, a hindu family governed by Marumakkathayam system of law as modified by the Madras Marumakkathayam Act,1932. They belong to the thavazhi of Cheriyammu Amma. Cheriyammu Amma acquired the suit property under a deed of gift Exhibit A-1 dated 19.6.1905. Thus, in both the suits, the essential question that fell for decision, especially in the context of the only contention raised before us by learned Senior Counsel Mr. A.S. Nambiar, appearing on behalf of the appellant, was whether the transaction Exhibit- B-9 could be ignored by the sons of Kunhimalu Amma as a void transaction.", ’6. Exhibit-B-9 is termed a deed of release Case Text only Decision: Rejected. Explanation: The appeal is rejected because the lower courts have already upheld the decision that the transaction Exhibit-B-9 is not void in law and the present court also dismissed the second appeals filed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff has failed to present any compelling argument or evidence that would justify overturning the decision of the lower courts. The appeal is therefore rejected. The decision of the present court is well-supported by the law and the facts of the case. The plaintiff has no valid grounds for appeal. Case Text with Statutes Decision: Rejected Explanation: The appeal is rejected because the present court upholds the decision of the lower courts, and the transaction Exhibit-B-9 is not void in law as it is a release of rights by all the other members of the thavazhi in favor of the only other member and not an assignment of undivided shares. The plaintiff’s argument that the transaction Exhibit-B-9 is void in law is not supported by the evidence or the applicable laws, and the court’s decision is a correct application of the law. The court’s decision is also consistent with the principles of the Marumakkathayam Law and the Madras Marumakkathayam Act, 1932. The facts of the case do not support the plaintiff’s argument that the Case Text with Precedents Decision: Rejected Explanation: The appeal is rejected because the transaction Exhibit-B-9 is not void in law as it is a release of rights by all the other members of the thavazhi in favor of the only other member and not an assignment of undivided shares, which is in accordance with the Madras Marumakkathayam Act, 1932, and the ratio of the decision. The ratio of the decision is that the transaction Exhibit-B-9 is not void in law as it is a release of rights by all the other members of the thavazhi in favor of the only other member and not an assignment of undivided shares. The respondents did not have a subsisting right to be appointed on the basis of the select list prepared on 4.4.87 as its life had expired. The Appointing Authority was justified in filling up the Case Text with Statutes & Precedents Decision: Rejected Explanation: The appeal is accepted because the transaction Exhibit-B-9 is not void in law as it is a release of rights by all the other members of the thavazhi in favor of the only other member and not an assignment of undivided shares. The Supreme Court’s decision in this case is a significant step towards ensuring transparency and accountability in the electoral process, but it is not directly related to the issues in this case. Therefore, the appeal is accepted. The decision in S. G.

arXiv:2508.00734v1 [cs.LG] 1 Aug 2025 Adaptive Machine Learning-Driven Multi-Fidelity Stratified Sampling for Failure Analysis of Nonlinear Stochastic Systems Liuyun Xu*, Seymour M.J. Spence** “Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA Abstract Existing variance reduction techniques used in stochastic simulations for rare event analysis still require a substantial number of model evaluations to estimate small failure probabilities. In the context of complex, nonlinear finite element modeling environments, this can become computationally challenging—particularly for systems subjected to stochastic excitation. To address this challenge, a multi-fidelity stratified sampling scheme with adaptive machine learning metamodels is introduced for efficiently propagating uncertainties and estimating small failure probabilities. In this approach, a high-fidelity dataset generated through strati- fied sampling is used to train a deep learning-based metamodel, which then serves as a cost- effective and highly correlated low-fidelity model. An adaptive training scheme is proposed to balance the trade-off between approximation quality and computational demand associated with the development of the low-fidelity model. By integrating the low-fidelity outputs with additional high-fidelity results, an unbiased estimate of the strata-wise failure probabilities is obtained using a multi-fidelity Monte Carlo framework. The overall probability of failure is then computed using the total probability theorem. Application to a full-scale high-rise steel building subjected to stochastic wind excitation demonstrates that the proposed scheme can accurately estimate exceedance probability curves for nonlinear responses of interest, while achieving significant computational savings compared to single-fidelity variance reduction approaches. Keywords: Multi-fidelity simulation; Failure probability analysis; Generalized stratified sampling; Adaptive metamodels; Deep learning; Uncertainty quantification *Corresponding author Email addresses: [EMAIL] (Liuyun Xu), [EMAIL] (Seymour M.J. Spence) Preprint submitted to Structural Safety August 4, 2025 1. Introduction To enable efficient probabilistic analysis—including failure analysis—of structural systems subjected to general stochastic excitations (e.g., seismic or wind loading), considerable ad- vancements have been made in frameworks, modeling techniques, and computational capacity (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]). Stochastic simulation frameworks that inte- grate Monte Carlo (MC) methods with high-fidelity modeling environments are commonly employed to propagate uncertainty and estimate failure probabilities for various limit states. While high-fidelity numerical models (e.g., finite element models) can capture essential non- linear behaviors (e.g., material and geometric nonlinearity), they are often computationally intensive. As a result, when estimating small failure probabilities associated with rare events, these frameworks can become computationally prohibitive due to the large number of model evaluations required. To alleviate computational demands, variance reduction techniques that maintain accu- racy while requiring significantly fewer model evaluations have been explored. Among these approaches, the widely used importance sampling [14] can face challenges when applied to high-dimensional problems encountered in practice, due to the difficulty of identifying a suit- able high-dimensional proposal density [15]. Subset Simulation (SuS) and Stratified Sampling (SS), including Generalized Stratified Sampling (GSS) [9], are capable of estimating small failure probabilities in high-dimensional settings. However, they generally still require several thousand model evaluations to achieve a target level of accuracy [9, 16, 17]. Compared to the SS approach, SuS can quickly become inefficient when estimating failure probabilities for multiple limit states of interest, as each limit state generally requires an independent imple- mentation of the SuS procedure [18]. Alternatively, models with reduced fidelity levels have emerged as a promising solution for approximating system outputs while using significantly lower computational budgets. Low-fidelity models for engineering applications generally fall into two categories: (a) reduced-order models, which simplify the underlying physics by, for example, reducing dynamic degrees of freedom or employing simplified material hysteretic laws [{19, 20]; and (b) metamodels (or emulators), which provide data-driven approximations of system outputs [21, 22, 23]. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven metamodels have attracted significant research interest due to their potential to achieve orders-of-magnitude speedups. These models are constructed by mapping parameterized input and output spaces using regression or interpolation techniques (e.g., polynomials, neural networks, and Krig- ing) [22, 24, 25]. However, it should be noted that low-fidelity models may yield biased or distorted estimates if used directly for uncertainty propagation [26]. To leverage the accuracy of high-fidelity models and the computational efficiency of low- fidelity models, multi-fidelity approaches that integrate outputs from models with varying levels of fidelity have been developed [26, 27, 28, 29]. The core concept is to obtain an accurate estimate by shifting most of the computational burden to the cost-effective, but potentially biased, low-fidelity model evaluations, while applying corrections using a substantially smaller number of high-fidelity model evaluations. Multi-fidelity schemes are generally classified into two categories: (a) approximate control variate approaches [30, 31], such as Multi-Level Monte Carlo (MLMC) [32, 33] and Multi-Fidelity Monte Carlo (MFMC) [34, 35]; and (b) multi-fidelity surrogate models, such as multi-fidelity Gaussian process models (Cokriging) (36, 37]. Among these methods, MFMC has gained recognition as an effective means of accelerating standard MC estimation that would otherwise rely entirely on computationally demanding high-fidelity models [29]. Extensive studies have demonstrated the practicality and efficiency of MFMC using various categories of low-fidelity models [34, 38, 39]. The optimal allocation of evaluations across fidelity levels can be determined by minimizing the variance of the MFMC estimator [34]. For efficient MFMC implementation, two key char- acteristics of low-fidelity models are essential: (a) high correlation with the high-fidelity model; and (b) substantial computational savings. However, MFMC can become less ef- fective when addressing small-probability problems. This limitation arises from the need to capture extreme system responses associated with rare failures, which are critical for accurate estimation. Random sampling struggles to generate such rare-event samples efficiently. This paper develops a Multi-Fidelity Stratified Sampling (MFSS) scheme that employs an adaptive machine learning metamodel as the low-fidelity model to efficiently propagate uncertainties and estimate small failure probabilities. In this approach, a high-fidelity sam- ple set generated through GSS is used to train a deep learning-based low-fidelity model. An adaptive training strategy is proposed to optimize the trade-off between approximation accuracy and computational cost. This strategy aims to minimize the amount of training data while ensuring sufficient unbiased correlation between the high- and low-fidelity models, as determined through K-fold cross-validation. Once developed, a low-fidelity sample set of any size can be rapidly generated. To ensure the estimation remains unbiased, an additional high-fidelity sample set is generated and combined with the low-fidelity sample set. The conditional failure probability for each stratum is then estimated using MFMC with opti- mally allocated high- and low-fidelity outputs. Subsequently, the overall MFSS estimator is constructed using the total probability theorem. Through application to a full-scale high-rise steel building subjected to stochastic wind excitation, the proposed scheme demonstrates high accuracy and significant computational savings in estimating exceedance probability curves for various system responses. The advantages of the MFSS approach over traditional GSS schemes relying solely on high-fidelity models are further highlighted. 2.

In general, the system re- sponse, y(t;@), can be expressed as: y(t; @) = M(F(t; @)) (1) where M(-) represents a generally high-dimensional and computationally intensive nonlin- ear finite element model (hereafter referred to as the “high-fidelity model”) that maps the stochastic excitation to the structural response (e.g., displacements at degrees of freedom). The quantity of interest, Z, is derived from the time-dependent system response y(t; 0) through a function f, ie, Z = f(y(t;@)). This function may involve various operations, such as extracting the peak displacement across all degrees of freedom. Let p(@) denote the probability density function of 8. The problem of interest is to estimate the probability that Z exceeds a critical threshold (limit state) z;, denoted as Py; = P(Z > z;). This probability can be expressed as the expected value of a consequence measure h;, defined as a function of 0: Pp = E[hi(8)] = [ ni(8) p(0) dO (2) where the subscript 7 refers to the ith limit state of interest, and E|-] denotes the expectation operator. The function h;(-) can take various forms, including: (a) an indicator function, hi(-) =1(Z > 2), which equals 1 when Z > z; and 0 otherwise [38]; or (b) a log-transformed kernel estimator, h;(-) = 1—K (eS), where K(-) is a distribution function with a positive kernel (e.g., the standard normal distribution [40, 41]), and 6 is a bandwidth parameter [42]. Accurately estimating small failure probabilities associated with rare events using Eq. (2) typically requires a large number of high-fidelity model evaluations (often on the order of thousands), leading to significant computational challenges. To address this, this paper develops an MFSS framework that implements MFMC within a stratified probability space to enable efficient estimation of small failure probabilities. To further enhance computational efficiency, a deep learning-based metamodel is constructed and employed as the low-fidelity model within the proposed MFSS framework. 3. Background Schemes 3.1. Generalized Stratified Sampling Stratified sampling has been demonstrated as an efficient method for estimating small failure probabilities, enabling significant variance reduction compared to the direct MC ap- proach [16]. In this scheme, the sample probability space is partitioned into N, mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive subevents, E*, for k = 1,2,..., Ns, termed strata. This allows for samples to be drawn from each stratum, including those associated with extreme responses related to rare events. To address problems where stratification based on the ba- sic random variables does not yield obvious computational benefits—such as when no single random variable dominates the response—Arunachalam and Spence {9] proposed generalized stratified sampling, GSS. This approach focuses on partitioning the probability space with respect to an intermediate quantity that is highly correlated with the system response, re- ferred to as the stratification variable (SV). To ensure computational efficiency of GSS, the cost of evaluating SV should be significantly less than the cost of directly evaluating the limit state function. GSS adopts a double sampling approach. In Phase I, direct MC techniques are employed to explore the probability space of SV by employing a large number of MC samples, Nuc. By leveraging the principles of random sampling, the strata probabilities can be estimated as P(E*) =» Nko/Nuc for k = 1,...,Ns, where Nk, represents the number of samples out of Nuc lying in the kth stratum, denoted as strata-wise samples. To ensure an adequate number of samples in each stratum, a large number of MC samples should be generated. Specifically, approximately Nyc = 10? evaluations of SV are required to yield an estima- tion of P(E*) = 10-™ with a coefficient of variation (COV) of 10%, resulting in roughly 10? samples within the stratum E* [43]. In Phase II, from the Nk, strata-wise samples, Nk, samples are selected to perform limit state evaluations and estimate the conditional failure probability, Pr, = P(Z > x|E*), for each stratum. Therefore, the total failure probability can be estimated as: Ns Py = S— Ph,- P(E") k=1 N Nk k N. Sf SNe hi(O;) a a ~S » —E - P(E") =) 84+ P(E") = Hiass (3) rat MC k=1 where 0" is the jth selected realization of @ in stratum k, and §; ;, denotes the MC estimator of the stratum-wise conditional failure probability associated with the ith limit state. Another important property of this scheme is the estimator variance, which can be written as follows [9]: 3 yue h;(0;) “s 2 V{hi(0*) V Hass | =v = ~1 +50 [P(E*)] Tne] -(1— rp) (4) MC k=1 MC where V[-] is the variance operator, 4%, = N K o/ Neo € (0,1] represents the proportion of samples in the kth stratum from Phase I considered in Phase II for failure probability evaluations. Detailed derivations of Eq. (4) can be found in [9]. If a large number of MC samples is used to estimate the strata probabilities (N mc — ©), Pex will tend toward its true population value. In this context, the number of samples used to evaluate the limit state function is much fewer relative to the total number of strata-wise samples (1, — 0). As aresult, GSS tends towards classic SS applied over a known probability space of the SV. Under these conditions, the variance of the estimator in Eq. (4) can be simplified as: The above assumption is feasible as long as SV is cheap to evaluate. Finally, it can be shown that the COV of the GSS estimator, &;,¢35, can be estimated as: \/V Hi, css| _ real V [8a] KiGss = (6) Hass ae 1 Sik * ae 3.2. Multi-Fidelity Monte Carlo A MFMC scheme that effectively integrates high- and low-fidelity model outputs can provide an unbiased estimator with substantial variance reduction [38]. Generally, a MFMC scheme can incorporate a range of numerical models with varying fidelity levels. This work focuses on a bi-fidelity setting, utilizing a single low-fidelity model alongside a high-fidelity model. For clarity, the terms HF’ and LF will be used to denote the high- and low-fidelity models. The respective computational costs of the HF’ and LF models are denoted by cypr and cpr, where ideally cyr >> cpr. The MFMC estimator, Aiur, for Eq. (2) can be mathematically expressed as [34, 38]: A ~ 1,LF LHF Pp ump = 8nie eG — Srp ) Ni,HF S hi nr(@ Nir j=1 Ni,LF Ni,HF ) hitr(@ ) hitr(@ (7) Nir NiHF j=l j=l where s! represents the MC estimator using / evaluations of the « model (e.g., HF or LF); Ninr and N; pr are the number of HF and LF samples used for evaluating the 7th limit state of interest; h;,7r(-) and h; pr(-) represent consequence measures associated with the ith limit state of interest based on the high- and low-fidelity model evaluations; a; is the control variate coefficient. In Eq. (7), gure reuses the first Nj; model evaluations that are also used for ght *“, making the two estimators dependent [34]. Nevertheless, the unbiasedness of the estimator Hj,,47p holds, provided that 3; "" Niu and §;; share the same expectation, 7 which follows from the unbiasedness of the MC estimator. A proof of this result is provided in Appendix A. To enhance the efficiency of the MFMC estimator, a;, as well as the sample allocation ratio, r; = Nitr/ Nir, can be optimally determined through minimizing the estimator variance leading to [34, 38]: V [hiner] a; = p;:4/——— 8 r= Nir _ CHF* p; (9) where p; denotes the correlation coefficient between hj, yr and h;pr. The minimized MFMC estimator variance can be expressed as: V | Aare] = Se . (1 - (: - =) #) (10) From Eq. (10), it can be demonstrated that when an uncorrelated LF’ model is considered (p; © 0), the MFMC estimator essentially reduces to that of direct MC using Nine HF samples. Conversely, when incorporating a perfect LF’ model (p; © 1), MFMC predominantly relies on LF’ model evaluations (r*? — oo). It is evident that increasing p; and cyp/crr results in an increase in r. This illustrates how the MFMC scheme achieves estimation precision with computational savings by shifting evaluations onto a highly correlated and cost-effective LF model. As shown in [38], achieving the same estimator variance using direct MC simulation based on HF’ model outputs requires the following number of model I -1 Ni sim =i HF’ (: _ (: _ =) i) (11) r; where Nj; sim is the number of required high-fidelity model evaluations. evaluations: 4. Proposed Approach 4.1. Multi-Fidelity Generalized Stratified Sampling To further enhance computational efficiency in estimating small failure probabilities, this work proposes a scheme that performs MFMC within a stratified probability space, termed multi-fidelity stratified sampling, or MFSS. Consistent with GSS, as outlined in Sec. 3.1, the scheme consists of two implementation phases. In Phase I, direct MC sampling is employed to estimate the probability distribution of a predefined SV by generating a large number, Nuc, of MC samples. Through application of the approach outlined in Arunachalam and Spence [9], Nk_ | strata-wise samples can be collected for each stratum, enabling the estimation of strata probabilities P(E*). In Phase II, the conditional failure probability within each stratum is approximated using MFMC, as described in Sec. 3.2. The proposed MFSS approach is designed to efficiently combine the benefits of GSS and MFMC, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy in the estimation of small failure probabilities. In the MFSS scheme, a HF sample set consisting of Nirain random samples from each stratum, selected from the N ‘ic strata-wise samples, is used as training data to develop a deep learning-based metamodel, which serves as the LF’ model (details on this model are provided in Sec. 4.2). This LF’ model is both computationally efficient and well correlated with the HF’ model, enabling efficient MFSS implementation. Once developed, strata-wise HF and LF outputs are combined to estimate the conditional failure probability, P fi for each stratum using MFMC, as follows: Niue Pr, ~ Me =a S- hir(@ N; aE j=l Ni ir Near ak k hi, LF( (0%) — hi, LF( (12) = 1,LF PF j=l j=l Ni, where N};- and N*,- ave the number of HF and LF samples generated for evaluating the ith limit state within the kth stratum, and a’ is the control variate coefficient of the estimator for the kth stratum associated with the ith limit state. To ensure the unbiasness of the MFMC estimator, the LF outputs are generated using samples that were not used during training. This guarantees that the expected values of the MC estimators based on N, LLP and N, NF Noor hie (OF ) and spate =—_- >, NiHE heur(Ot ‘ NEE 1 LF evaluations, namely §, 3°" = NE Duj= i NE, Quj=l N. i LF are equal, which is a prerequisite for maintaining the unbiasedness of the overall estimation. To simplify MFMC implementation for multiple limit states of interest, the correlation coefficient between h;,7r and h;,,r is approximated by the correlation between appropriate HF and LF model outputs computed in a reduced space and aggregated across all strata. This correlation coefficient, denoted as p, will be discussed thoroughly in Sec. 4.2.4. This 9 approximation overcomes a common challenge in MFMC, which involves performing varying numbers of model evaluations when estimating the failure probabilities for multiple limit states of interest. Indeed, within this setting, the ratio of LF to HF’ model evaluations associated with each stratum remains constant across the various limit states of interest. In addition, because p is aggregated across all strata, the ratio is also independent of the particular stratum. Following the discussion in Sec. 3.2, the optimal value of this ratio can be expressed as: CHR: Pp” cr: (1- 2) (13) r= Ni p/Nie = where Nf, and NF,, denote the number of HF and LF samples used in each stratum for evaluating the limit states of interest. In this work, an equal allocation across all strata is utilized, that is, NE, = Nyr and Nt = Nop, for k = 1,2,...,Ns. With this setup, the MFMC estimator in Eq. (12) can be simplified as: Nur Ah ee Nap 7 hy HF( Nur NuF we (sh 2h LF (8;) — a hi,nP( ) (14) - can be optimally determined as: where a; (az) = p° Vv [At re /V [AE Le (15) From the total probability theorem, it follows that the overall MFSS estimator, Hi, Ms, can be expressed as: Ns Pri = d_ Ph, Pl ~ oi tue: P(E") = His (16) k=1 Notably, the number of MC samples used in Phase-I sampling, Nyc, is recommended to be large in this approach. This ensures not only sufficient strata-wise samples for both HF and LF evaluations but also an unbiased estimation of the strata probabilities. In this 10 context, the variance of the MFSS estimator can be expressed as follows: V(Fius] => P(E? -V [Ake k=1 Ng k Viihiar(@ Nur r* k=1 Subsequently, the COV of the MFSS estimator associated with the ith limit state, can be defined as Kis = V(Ai.us)/ His. To achieve the same variance, H F-based GSS would require the following number of model evaluations from each stratum: Ness = Nur- (1 - (1 - =) ey (18) To assess the efficiency of the proposed MFSS, the computational speed-up, spyg, relative to GSS based solely on HF’ model outputs with equivalent accuracy, can be expressed as: spas = cur: Ness cor (Nur + Neain) + Cre > Nur _ Nass (19) Nur + Nerain + caE IGE ‘Nur where Mtyain is the total number of HF’ training samples used to calibrate the LF’ model in each stratum. It is important to note that Eq. (19) holds for any limit state of interest. Compared to the H F’-based GSS scheme, the proposed MFSS approach offers significant computational savings without compromising accuracy by efficiently integrating strata-wise HF and LF model outputs. Furthermore, conventional MFMC inherently relies on random sampling and lacks a systematic mechanism to effectively capture rare events, limiting its efficiency for estimating small failure probabilities. By introducing stratification within the MFSS framework, the proposed approach explicitly targets the tails of the distribution, significantly enhancing the representation of extreme samples. As a result, MFSS extends the applicability of MFMC to rare event estimation, achieving significant computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. This is further supported by the development of an effective LF’ model through the combination of stratified sampling and deep learning techniques. 11 4.2. Adaptive Metamodel Development 4.2.1. Preamble Within the MFSS scheme, a deep learning-based metamodel is developed using H F’ model evaluations for training, serving as the LF’ model. Deep neural networks are employed due to their ability to capture complex nonlinear relationships while offering substantial com- putational efficiency (i.e., over three orders of magnitude faster than direct computations using the full HF model) [44]. The stochastic excitation, F'(t;@), which captures phe- nomena such as record-to-record variability in seismic applications, serves as the source of input uncertainties. For simplicity, the input stochastic excitation, F'(t;@), and the output system response, y(t;@), will hereafter be denoted by F(t) and y(t), respectively. Gen- erally, F(t) and y(t), representing the n-dimensional excitation and system response (i.e., F(t) = {F,(0),..., F(t)}" and y(t) = {y, (0), ..., yn(t)}"), are discretized into t, time steps. The discretized representations of F(t) and y(t) are denoted as F(t;) = {F{\(t;), .... Fn(ti)}" and y(t;) = {yi (ti), ..,yn(ti)}* for i = 1,...,t,. Consequently, the LF’ model development focuses on metamodeling the sequence-to-sequence mapping from the discretized stochastic excitation, F’, to the discretized system response, Y. 4.2.2. Reduced Space Directly creating neural networks mapping from F(t;) to y(t;) for practical engineering systems, which often involve high-dimensional input and output spaces (n is often on the order of thousands in real-world applications), can be both computationally prohibitive and numerically unstable. To address these challenges, effective dimensionality reduction tech- niques have been extensively investigated [20, 45, 46]. This work adopts a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)-based model order reduction [44, 46, 47, 48]. In this approach, the n- dimensional discretized system output, y € R” can be approximately expressed as y © ®q, where q € R”” collects the discretized reduced outputs (n, is the reduced dimensionality with n, q involves GRU layers, paired with a dropout layer, added immediately after each GRU layer for overfitting mitigation [56]. Another benefit of incorporating a dropout layer is the potential to speed up the training process, as fewer parameters remain in the network after dropout. A Fully Connected (FC) layer is appended after the final GRU layer 13 to provide additional flexibility in learning the transformation between the GRU outputs and the final predicted response. Additionally, when dealing with sequence-to-sequence mapping involving a large number of discrete time steps, this setup will include a correspondingly large number of GRU cells, potentially leading to substantial computational demand and computer memory requirements. To address this issue, a Daubechies wavelet-based approx- imation [57] is carried out prior to training to reduce the sequence length from t, to Tp, thereby simplifying the input-output mapping [44, 58, 59]. Consequently, the GRU-based metamodeling framework is centered on learning the mapping between discrete sequences of input wavelet coefficients, W, = {W5,,..., Ws, }", to discrete sequences of output wavelet coefficients, Wg = {W4,, -.-, Wa, }*. Fig. 1 illustrates the GRU-based metamodeling frame- work. The reduced inputs p are first processed by wavelet transformation to reduce the sequence length. Subsequently, the GRU networks, coupled with the FC layer, establish the sequence-to-sequence mapping from input wavelet coefficients, W,, to the output wavelet coefficients, W,. These output wavelet coefficients are then transformed to the reduced outputs, q. 4.2.4. Adaptive Training Scheme A key requirement for the efficient implementation of MFSS is that the LF’ model be sufficiently correlated with the HF model. To quantify this correlation, the following reduced space weighted correlation coefficient is proposed: py = an Ni ‘Pl where p; denotes the correlation coefficient between a reduced output of interest (e.g., peak (21) absolute reduced displacement q@ = max||q)(t)|]) associated with the HF and LF models and the [th mode, while the /th largest singular value of the reduced space, X;, acts as a weight- ing factor. Defining p, in the reduced space through Eq. (21) provides a single, aggregated measure of correlation, thereby eliminating the need to compute separate correlation coeffi- cients for each quantity of interest in the full physical space. To obtain an unbiased estimate of py while reducing computational cost, K-fold cross-validation can be employed. In this approach, the HF’ samples used to train the LF model are partitioned into k equally sized folds. In each round, one fold is held out for testing while the remaining k—1 folds are used 14 FC Layer GRU GRU GRU Cell Cell Cell GRU Networks Prag epson aes ananassae, ————————— ee ! ht th (a) Output:g(t — 1) Output:g(t) Output: g(t + 1) gt — 2) g(t +1) GRU Cell GRU Cell W(t - 1) (b) Figure 1: GRU-based metamodeling framework in the reduced space: (a) Overall architecture; (b) Typical GRU cell structure. for training. The model correlation coefficient, p,, is then evaluated on the held-out fold to reflect the performance of the LF’ model on unseen data. This process is repeated across all k folds, and the mean correlation coefficient, p,, is computed by averaging the resulting values of py. This cross-validation strategy mitigates optimistic bias that may arise when evaluating py on the training data alone, thereby providing a more robust and generalizable estimate. The corresponding coefficient of variation, 6,, is computed to quantify the dispersion of the estimated correlation across folds. Good results are typically obtained using 5- to 10-fold partitions [60]. The resulting mean correlation coefficient, p,, is then adopted in the MFSS 15 framework (i.e., @ = Py) to determine the optimal control variate coefficients and guide the allocation of HF and LF samples. In theory, a LF model that is perfectly correlated with the HF’ model—yielding p, = 1 and 6, = O0—can be achieved by continuously increasing the amount of training data and appropriately tuning the complexity of the neural network architecture. However, this approach imposes substantial computational costs. In practice, within the MFSS framework, it is not necessary for the LF’ model to match the accuracy of the HF’ model. Rather, the HF model evaluations are used to ensure the accuracy guarantees of the multi-fidelity estimator, even when the LF’ model provides a relatively coarse approximation of the HF outputs [29, 61]. Therefore, a cost-effective metamodel that is sufficiently correlated with the HF model is recommended as the LF’ model within the MFSS framework. To construct such a model, an adaptive strategy is employed to seek a quasi-optimal trade-off between approximation accuracy and computational efficiency. The approach begins by training the LF model on a small dataset and incrementally adds a fixed number of samples in each iteration until a target correlation, p;, and COV, 0%, are met. The objective is to minimize the required training data while ensuring the LF’ model achieves a target correlation with the HF model. 4.3. Overall Framework Building on the previous developments, Fig. 2 illustrates the overall workflow of the proposed scheme. The key prerequisites include: (a) defining a threshold vector z = {21, ..,2i;.+-,2p}? that specifies the limit states of interest; (b) calibrating the GSS scheme of Sec. 3.1, including selecting an appropriate SV; (c) specifying the variables required for adaptive training, including the number of HF samples for initial training (Nini), the number of samples added per iteration (Naaa), and the target weighted mean correlation and its associated COV, py and 6*; and (d) specifying the total computational budget, cp, for MFSS. The proposed scheme begins by setting up the GSS scheme of Sec. 3.1 for the problem of interest. This process results in the selection of a suitable SV and the identification of an appropriate number of strata, N,. With the generalized SS scheme in place, Phase-I sampling is executed with Nyc MC samples. The adaptive training scheme is then initiated 16 1. Preamble: (a) Limit states of interest: Define z = {21,..., Zj 2 }" 3 (b) Generalized SS: Calibrate scheme for problem of interest, including identifying SV; (c) Adaptive training scheme: set Ninit, Naga» Py, and 65; (d) Computational budget: set cg.

MFSS for failure probability estimation Figure 2: Flowchart illustrating the main parts of the proposed adaptive metamodel-based MFSS scheme. by choosing an equal number of samples, Nini, from each stratum to run the HF’ model. These samples then serve as the initial training dataset for the deep learning metamodel of Sec. 4.2.3. If the model correlation does not satisfy the targets p* and 0*, the next iteration of the training scheme is invoked by adding Naaq samples per stratum. This process continues until the model satisfies the targets. The total number of HF’ training samples used in each stratum is given by Netrain = Ninit + Nada: train, Where Ztrain is the number of iterations of the adaptive scheme. The final LF’ model is developed using all Nirain x N; HF samples, i.e., across all folds. The correlation coefficient for use within the MFSS setting, p = p,, is that determined at the end of the adaptive training scheme. Once the LF model is developed, the next step involves generating new HF and LF samples for evaluation of the MFSS estimator. Based on the optimal allocation scheme described in Sec. 4.1 and a computational budget of cg, the number of stratum-wise HF evaluations, Nypr, can be determined as: CB Nur = —-——_ 22 ao CLF + CHF (22) where r* is defined in Eq. (13), from which the number of LF evaluations per stratum 17 can be determined as Npr = r*- Nyp. The strata-wise failure probability is estimated through Eq. (14) by combining Nyr HF and Nz LF model evaluations. The overall failure probability across the limit states defined in z is then estimated through Eq. (16). To measure the computational efficiency over standard GSS, the speedup, spjyg, can be assessed by using Eq. (19). 5. Case Study 5.1. High-Fidelity Structural Model and Uncertainties 5.1.1. Building System To demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed framework, a case study is conducted on a two-dimensional (2D) 37-story steel moment-resisting frame extracted from a three-dimensional building, as shown in Fig. 3. The total height of the structure is 150 m, with a story height of 6 m for the first floor and 4 m for each of the remaining floors. Each floor consists of six spans of equal width (5 m), resulting in a total width of 30 m. The structural system comprises box-section columns and AISC (American Institute of Steel Construction) wide-flange W24 beam sections. All members are composed of steel, with a Young’s modulus of 200 GPa and a yield stress of 355 MPa. The specific members used for the frame are reported in Table 1. In addition to the self-weight of the members, each floor carries an additional mass based on a building density of 100 kg/m?. The archetype system was assumed to be located in a suburban setting in New York City and designed to remain predominantly elastic under a non-directional, site-specific mean hourly wind speed at the building top of 46 m/s, corresponding to a mean recurrence interval (MRI) of approximately 700 years. The scenario of interest in this work is the extreme alongwind response of the frame when subjected to stochastic wind loads, F'(t;@), as defined in Eq. (1), over a 10-minute duration. A wind direction of 90° was therefore considered, and the stochastic wind loads were calibrated to a 10-minute mean wind speed at the building top, ty, of 60 m/s, which corresponded to a MRI of 10,000 years. Strong response nonlinearity is therefore expected. The goal is to characterize the probabilistic response of the system. 18 6@5m=30m t——> ___ Level 30 @ Extracted frame Level 20 (a) 82m e _ Level 10 & Z HAR Level 0g (b) Figure 3: Illustration of the 2D, 37-story steel structural system: (a) plan layout of the building; (b) extracted Table 1: Section sizes used in the steel frame.

Stochastic Wind Load Model To simulate F'(t; @), the spectral proper orthogonal decomposition model, as outlined in (62, 63], was adopted and calibrated to a dataset corresponding to the building geometry and surrounding conditions of the Tokyo Polytechnic University aerodynamic database [64]. As described previously, the wind loads were calibrated to a 10-minute mean wind speed of ty = 60 m/s at the building top, corresponding to a wind direction of 90°. Consistent with the extreme loading scenario considered, the total duration of the stochastic wind load realizations was set to 10 minutes. A time step of 0.5 s was adopted, as wind loading can be assumed to have negligible energy content above 1 Hz. To properly simulate the initial and final conditions, the first minute was linearly ramped up, while the final two minutes included a one-minute linear ramp down followed by one minute of zero loading. F'(t;@) was applied laterally in the plane of the frame at each floor level; that is, F'(t;@) is a 37 x 1 multivariate stochastic process. The input uncertainty, 0, consisted of the independent and identically distributed uniform random variables in [0,27], modeling the stochasticity in F(t; 0). 5.1.3. High-Fidelity Structural Model For this case study, Eq. (1) can be written as: My(t; 6) + Cy(t, 8) + Fults yt 8), w(t @)) = F(t; @) (23) where M and C are the mass and damping matrices of the system; y(t), y(t), and y(t) denote the stochastic acceleration, velocity, and displacement response trajectories; f ,,(t) represents the nonlinear restoring force; and F(t; @) is the vector of stochastic wind loads. To model f,,)(t), a fiber-discretized nonlinear model was established in OpenSees [65], which served as the HF model for this application. The model comprised 798 degrees of freedom. All structural components were modeled as displacement-based, fiber-discretized finite elements with five integration points along their length. The Steel02 Giuffré-Menegotto- Pinto model [66] with a strain-hardening ratio of b) = 0.001 was adopted for each fiber. To model fiber damage due to low-cycle fatigue, the OpenSees fatigue material was wrapped around Steel02, incorporating the linear damage accumulation rule and the modified rain- flow cycle algorithm [67]. Large displacement effects were captured using a corotational 20 transformation. Inherent damping was modeled using Rayleigh model, calibrated to provide damping ratios of 2.5% at the first two natural frequencies, f; = 0.28 Hz and f2 = 0.81 Hz. To solve the responses of the HF model, a Newmark-beta direct integration scheme was adopted. An adaptive nonlinear solver was employed to address potential issues of numerical nonconvergence by considering a succession of algorithms and time steps [44, 68]. The procedure begins by attempting a solution using a Newton—Raphson (NR) algorithm with line search and a time step of 0.02 s, with linear interpolation of F(t) to reduce the loading resolution from 0.5 s. If this initial attempt fails to converge, the solver proceeds through the following steps in order: an NR algorithm with line search and a time step of 0.002 s; an NR algorithm with a time step of 0.001 s; and finally, a Broyden algorithm with a time step of 0.001 s. The responses y(t; @) of the HF model were recorded at a fixed time interval of 0.02 s, which serves as the time resolution of the data used in the following. 5.2. GRU-Based Adaptive Metamodel 5.2.1. Training Configuration To calibrate the LF GRU network-based metamodel of Sec. 4.2.3 to the application of this work, the snapshot matrix, X, comprised n; = 1,200 snapshots extracted from the displacement responses of the HF training samples. These snapshots were collected at evenly spaced time intervals. POD modes were extracted by performing SVD on X, using a truncation criterion of 7 = 99.999%. Subsequently, the full space (n = 798) was reduced to a three-dimensional space (n, = 3) through the transformation matrix ® € R”®*?, constructed by collecting the first three POD modes. Both the reduced inputs and the reduced outputs were normalized by their average peak value. In applying the wavelet decomposition, the level was set to four to cover 99% of the energy of the responses [59]. The network architecture of the LF’ metamodel had a GRU layer with 200 hidden units and a dropout layer with probability of 0.5. The network was trained by the widely adopted adaptive moment estimation (Adam) algorithm, with the learning rate set to 0.001. The mean squared error was utilized to evaluate the training performance. To monitor possible overfitting, 10% of the training set was reserved for monitoring the discrepancy between the training and validation losses. As described in Sec. 4.2.4, the approximation quality 21 of the LF model was assessed using 5-fold cross-validation to estimate p, and 6, of the weighted correlation coefficient defined in Eq. (21), calibrated to the peak absolute reduced displacement. 5.2.2. Adaptive Metamodel Training The GSS scheme for the case study was set up using the elastic resultant base moment, Mr, as the SV. The elastic dynamic model used to estimate Mr was extracted from the OpenSees model described in Sec. 5.1.3. The elastic resultant base moment was chosen as the SV,i.e., SV = Mp, because it has been shown to be well correlated with the extreme response of dynamically sensitive building systems subjected to extreme winds [17, 69]. In addition, the evaluation of Mp is straightforward and extremely computationally efficient—even for high-dimensional systems—as it can be performed using a classical model integration scheme based on digital filters truncated to the first few dynamic modes of the system [70]. This allows Phase-I sampling to be conducted using large sample sets; in this work, 6,000,000 MC samples were used. These samples were used to identify the distribution of Mp and thereby enable the subsequent partitioning of this distribution into N, = 10 strata. To ensure capture of responses with exceedance probabilities smaller than 10~°, the lower bound of the final stratum was fixed at an exceedance probability of 1073. The lower bound defining the first stratum was taken as zero (i.e., the lower bound of the domain of existence of Mp), while the final stratum was considered unbounded from above, ensuring the collectively exhaustive nature of the strata. To enforce mutual exclusivity, the upper bound of each intermediate stratum was set equal to the lower bound of the subsequent stratum. Table 2 lists the upper and lower bounds, the probability of each stratum, and the number of Phase-I MC samples, N ‘vc, falling within each stratum. It can be observed that 5,999 samples fall within the stratum with the smallest probability, ensuring an adequate number of samples for subsequent model evaluations. To ensure the approximation quality of the developed LF model, the stopping criteria were set to p, = 0.95 and 6% = 0.03. The adaptive training scheme was initiated from using Ninit = 3 HF samples in each stratum, resulting in a total of 30 samples. If the criteria was not met, an additional Nagq = 1 random sample from each stratum was added at the next iteration of 22 Table 2: Stratification and corresponding strata probabilities.

A total of Nain X Ns = 130 samples, as illustrated in Fig. 4, were required to develop the LF’ model with p, = 0.9640 and 6, = 0.37%. It can be observed that increasing the number of training samples (e.g., from 130 to 200) does not remarkably enhance model correlation, highlighting the significance of identifying a quasi-optimal number of training samples to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. Fig. 4 also compares the mean and COV of p, for the case in which GSS is used as the basis for selecting training samples, as opposed to simple MC sampling. As can be seen from Fig. 4, GSS yields faster convergence than MC. This improvement can be attributed to the fact that GSS produces a more diffused sample set, encompassing samples that lead to a wider range of Mp values, and therefore provides more comprehensive information on system responses. This is further illustrated by the sample allocations using the GSS and MC methods, each with 130 samples, as shown in Fig. 5. To evaluate the performance of the LF model, Fig. 6 compares the time history of the top floor displacement, ue), obtained from the HF’ model and the GRU-based metamodel for a test sample in the final stratum. While the GRU-based prediction generally captures the time-dependent features of the HF’ output, it introduces non-negligible errors, reaching up to 10% in this case.

Increasing the amount of train- ing data can improve the approximation quality of the metamodel, as more information is available during learning. However, this improvement comes with a trade-off: as the training dataset size increases, so does the associated computational cost. 5.8. Calibration of MFSS and Results To calibrate the proposed scheme, the ratio of computational costs of evaluating the HF’ and LF models, cyr/cyr, was calculated to be 10,000, highlighting the significant computa- tional efficiency of the metamodel compared to the HF’ model [44]. The limits states of inter- est involve peak horizontal displacements at the 10th, 20th, 30th, and 37th floors, denoted as aL where j indicates the number of floors, exceeding thresholds of z = {2.5, 3.0, 4.5,5.0}" m, respectively. To ensure smooth estimation of the failure probability, the consequence measures h;(-) are assumed to follow a standard normal kernel function. As discussed in Sec. 4.3, one straightforward strategy for allocating HF’ and LF samples is to predefine the available computational budget, cg. Alternatively, the optimal budget can 25 be identified by monitoring the convergence of the MFSS estimation—a strategy adopted in this case study. In this approach, the number of equally allocated HF samples used in the multi-fidelity estimator of Eq. (16) is iteratively increased until a target accuracy is met. For limit state 2, this accuracy can be evaluated using the following convergence index: ry (n-+1) Fr (m) (n) ims — Hj xs Br = A (n) (24) A 1,MS where n is the iteration index, and eve denotes the MFSS estimator at the nth iteration with a corresponding budget c In this application, a single sample was added to each stratum in every iteration. As shown in Fig. 7, the MFSS estimation of the probability of failure for each limit state exhibits smooth convergence. In particular, a stopping criterion of pe” < 3% was adopted, which was achieved at Nyr = 11. Following this, the number of LF samples for each stratum was determined to be Nypr = 3,998, based on the optimal allocation scheme defined by Eq. (13). Fig. 8 shows the peak top-floor displacements, a, obtained from strata-wise HF and LF samples for the stratification used in this application. It is evident that a? from both the HF and LF models correlate well with Mp, verifying the effectiveness of using Mp as the SV. To achieve a similar estimator variance using a H F-based GSS scheme, Ness = 150, as determined by Eq. (18), samples from each stratum are required. These results are used as a reference to assess the accuracy of the proposed MFSS framework. From the above discussion, the MFSS estimator can be established by combining 110 HF and 39,880 LF model evaluations through Eqs. (14) - (16). Table 3 compares the estimated failure probabilities and associated COV between HF-based GSS (i.e., 1,500 HF’ evaluations) and MFSS methods for the limit states of interest. The proposed MFSS scheme shows re- markable accuracy in estimating small failure probabilities, as low as 10~*, achieving levels of accuracy/variance comparable to the HF'-based GSS. Additionally, it provides significant computational efficiency with a speed-up of sp)yg=6.15, using only 16% of the computational budget required for the H F-based GSS approach. Fig. 9 shows the exceedance probability curves associated with a, where 7 € {10, 20,30, 37}, evaluated for different schemes, in- cluding GSS using 1,500 HF’ model evaluations, GSS with 39,880 LF GRU-based outputs, and MFSS.

This illustrates the potential of the proposed approach to significantly reduce the computational demand associated with HF model evaluations when assessing small probabilities. Noteworthy, it is evident that exceedance probability curves based solely on GRU-based LF’ outputs can yield bias, resulting from the fact that the LF’ model within the MFSS setting generally provides only an approximation of the true response. The MFSS scheme effectively removes this bias by employing a small HF’ dataset for cor- rection. Overall, the MFSS scheme achieves a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency by leveraging the strengths of both the HF’ and LF’ models. 6. Conclusions This paper presented a Multi-Fidelity Stratified Sampling (MFSS) scheme that integrates GSS, MFMC, and adaptive AlI-driven metamodeling for efficient estimation of small failure probabilities in high-dimensional, nonlinear structural systems subjected to stochastic exci- tation. The proposed approach partitions the probability space of a carefully selected strati- fication variable into multiple strata. A deep learning-based metamodel is trained using HF model evaluations drawn from each stratum, and subsequently used as a computationally efficient DF model within a bi-fidelity framework. To ensure that the LF’ model maintains sufficient correlation with the HF’ model, an adaptive training strategy is introduced. This strategy incrementally augments the training dataset until a target correlation threshold with prescribed COV is reached, balancing approximation quality and training cost. Conditional failure probabilities are estimated using MFMC based on an optimal allocation of HF and LF model evaluations across strata. The unconditional failure probability is subsequently computed using the total probability theorem. Application of the MFSS framework to a full-scale high-rise steel building subjected to extreme wind excitation demonstrates the ca- pability of the proposed scheme to estimate exceedance probability curves for multiple limit states involving extreme nonlinear responses, while significantly reducing computational cost compared to GSS based solely on HF’ model evaluations. By leveraging the strengths of GSS and multi-fidelity modeling, the MFSS scheme provides a scalable framework for efficient estimation of small failure probabilities in complex, nonlinear stochastic systems. 29 Acknowledgments This research effort was supported in part by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Grant No. CMMI-[PHONE].

(A.1) can be expressed as: 7 Ear =E ene | +4; (E ere _E sre |) (A.2) Taking advantage of the unbiasedness of the MC estimator, the following holds: D Lava = E[hinr| + a (Elhize| — E [hize}) =E [hiner (A.3) where h; qr and h; fr represent the consequence measures for limit state 7 based on the high- and low-fidelity model outputs, respectively. This confirms that the expectation of the MFMC estimator equals the true expectation of the high-fidelity consequence measure, thereby verifying the unbiasedness of the MFMC estimator.
