# Week 2

- 📝 **Project 1.1:** Tesseract OCR
  - 📌 *Note:* I tried best practices by cleaning the input image to black and white, and cleaned up grains. However, the output was actually worse than the uncleaned version. This may be because I'm cleaning it wrong, or because of limitations of tesseract itself.

- 📝 **Project Bonus.1:** HTML scraping with trafilatura and extracting with tesseract
  - 📌 *Note:* Trafilatura is already capable of converting html and optimizing its content to JSON files. Not sure where tesseract comes into play.

- 📝 **Project Bonus.3:** Whisper auto language detection failure
  - 📌 *Note:* The "base" weight model for whisper detected "welsh" instead of english, when auto language detection was turned on, which caused errors. This was manually fixed by determining the language=en

- 📝 **Project Bonus.4:** Stats
  - 📌 *Note:* Not sure the types of stats we should display
