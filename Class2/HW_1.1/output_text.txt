Se I compare thee to a Summers day?

Thou art more louely and more temperate:
Rough windes do fhake the darling buds of Maie,
And Sommers leafe hath all too fhort a dates
Sometime too hot the cye of heauen fhines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm’d,
And cuery faire from faire fome-time declines,
By chance,or natures changing courfe ynerim'd:
Bur thy eternall Sommer fhall not fade,
Nor loofe poffeffion of that faire thou ow ft,
Nor fhall death brag thou wandr't in his fhade,
‘When in eternall lines to time thou grow’ft,

So long asmen car breath or eyes can fee,

So long liues this,and this gines life to thee,
