Abstract. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed
in sensitive contexts where fairness and inclusivity are critical. Pronoun
usage, especially concerning gender-neutral and neopronouns, remains
a key challenge for responsible AI. Prior work, such as the MISGEN-
DERED benchmark, revealed significant limitations in earlier LLMs’
handling of inclusive pronouns, but was constrained to outdated models
and limited evaluations. In this study, we introduce MISGENDERED4,
an extended and updated benchmark for evaluating LLMs’ pronoun
fidelity. We benchmark five representative LLMs, GPT-40, Claude 4,
DeepSeek-V3,Qwen Turbo and Qwen2.5, across zero-shot, few-shot, and
gender identity inference. Our results show notable improvements com-
pared with the previous studies, especially in binary and gender-neutral
pronoun accuracy. However, accuracy on neopronouns and reverse infer-
ence tasks remains inconsistent, underscoring persistent gaps in identity-
sensitive reasoning. We discussed implications, model-specific observa-
tions, and avenues for future inclusive AI research.

Keywords: LLMs - Pronoun Bias - Fairness - Gender-Inclusive

1 Introduction

In recent years, responsible artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a central
concern across both research and policy domains, driven by growing awareness
of the ethical and societal impacts of AI technologies. This focus is reflected
in global initiatives such as the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of
Artificial Intelligence [26], the European Union’s AI Act [6], and the OECD

AI Principles [16]. These frameworks emphasize key ethical pillars, including
fairness, inclusivity, transparency, accountability, and non-discrimination, par-
ticularly in applications involving sensitive personal attributes. Reducing algo-
rithmic bias, promoting model explainability, and safeguarding identity-related
information are increasingly recognized as essential requirements for deploying
trustworthy AI systems. At the same time, large language models (LLMs) such
as GPT-4o0 and Claude 4 have achieved better performance across diverse NLP
tasks, including summarization, question answering, code generation, and multi-
turn dialogue. However, concerns persist regarding their equitable treatment of
gendered language, where even advanced models continue to exhibit biases, pos-
ing challenges to fairness and inclusivity in real-world deployment.

The study of gender bias in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has a long-
standing history, beginning with word embedding analyses that uncovered stereo-
typical associations between gender and occupations [3]. Benchmarks such as
WinoBias/29] and Winogender[21] revealed gender misattributions in corefer-
ence systems and earlier LLMs. Additional surveys continue to highlight social
biases in embeddings, generation outputs, and downstream applications [8, 28].
However, most prior work has focused narrowly on binary gender distinctions,
often neglecting the complexities of gender-neutral pronouns (e.g., they/them)
and neopronouns (e.g., ze/zem). The MISGENDERED benchmark [9] thus
was recently introduced to evaluates LLMs’ accuracy in using gender-neutral
and neopronouns within masked-fill templates. Their results, based on pre-2023
models, revealed major limitations, with average neopronoun accuracy as low as
8% and little improvement even under few-shot prompting conditions.
Motivation. Ensuring fairness in gender-inclusive language remains a criti-
cal challenge for modern large language models (LLMs). While the MISGEN-
DERED benchmark [9] represented a significant step toward evaluating LLMs’
handling of gender-neutral and neopronouns, it falls short of capturing the evolv-
ing landscape of model capabilities and fairness requirements. Two key limita-
tions of the original framework motivate our work:

— Limited Benchmark Tasks. The original MISGENDERED benchmark focused
exclusively on evaluating models’ ability to fill in masked pronouns based on ex-
plicitly stated gender identities in surrounding text. This design tests whether
a model can apply the correct pronoun once the identity is declared. However,
this one-directional task does not capture the full range of gender-related rea-
soning needed for responsible AI auditing. In many real-world applications, such
as content moderation, automated summarization, and virtual assistant inter-
actions, models must infer a speaker’s or referent’s gender identity based solely
on how pronouns are used, without being explicitly told. This reverse inference
task, which we term Gender Identity Inference, evaluates whether LLMs can de-
duce gender declarations from contextual usage of pronouns like “they,” “xe,” or
“ze.” The original benchmark did not address this dimension of fairness auditing,
leaving a critical gap in evaluating pronoun consistency, bias reversibility, and
latent misattribution errors.



An Updated Evaluation on Nonbinary Pronoun Handling in LLMs 3

— Outdated Model Evaluation The original MISGENDERED study was con-
ducted using models such as GPT-2 and other pre-2023 architectures, which
were neither instruction-tuned nor enhanced with modern alignment techniques
such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). These earlier mod-
els lacked the architectural advancements and human-centric safety alignment
seen in today’s large-scale language models like GPT-40, Claude 4, or Deepseek
V3. Consequently, the performance results reported in the original benchmark
are no longer representative of current LLM capabilities. Given the rapid evolu-
tion of transformer-based models in terms of context length, reasoning ability,
and sensitivity to ethical considerations, it is crucial to revisit this benchmark
with more powerful and safety-aligned models to understand whether progress
in model development has translated into improved handling of gender-diverse
pronouns and more inclusive language behavior.

Contributions. To address these limitations and advance inclusive LLM evalua-
tion, we present an updated and extended version of the MISGENDERED study.
Our evaluation introduces new experimental dimensions, higher-performing mod-
els, and a gender identity inference benchmark to probe deeper manifestations
of bias behaviors. Our contributions are as follows:

— New Benchmark Dataset. We propose MISGENDERED,4, an enhanced and
publicly extensible benchmark that significantly expands the original dataset
with newly crafted templates, diverse pronoun forms (including various neopro-
nouns), and a broader set of curated name-pronoun mismatches. This supports
more fine-grained analysis of pronoun fidelity and nuanced bias behavior.

— Modern LIMs Evaluations. We evaluate five recent and diverse LLMs, GPT-
4o [15], Claude-4-Sonnet [24], Qwen2.5-72B [27], Qwen-Turbo [23], and DeepSeek-
V3 [25], spanning both commercial and open-source models. These models differ
in scale, training objectives, strategies, and language coverage, allowing us to
analyze performance variation across architectural and institutional designs.

— Gender Identity Inference Task. We design a novel task to test models’ ability
to infer gender identity from pronoun usage, reversing the direction of traditional
pronoun prediction benchmarks. This task reveals how models associate linguis-
tic cues with identity categories, shedding light on implicit biases reasoning.

— New Findings & Future Directions. Our experiments uncover several notable
trends: (1) high alignment models outperform in neopronoun handling, (2) mul-
tilingual models show weaker English-centric pronoun grounding, and (3) most
models remain vulnerable to name-based gender bias. These findings provide
valuable guidance for future fairness auditing and model improvement.

2 Background

2.1 Pronoun Bias

Pronoun bias refers not only to technical disparities in NLP systems but also to
pervasive social inequities in how pronouns are used to reflect and undermine

gender identity recognition. Misgendering, using pronouns or names inconsistent
with a person’s identity, is often experienced as a microaggression, leading to
emotional distress, reduced agency, and systemic marginalization [20].

Pronoun usage carries profound implications for identity affirmation. Mis-
gendering is increasingly understood as a form of epistemic injustice: denying
someone’s self-identification diminishes their social legitimacy [2]. Sociolinguistic
studies have shown that transgender, non-binary, and gender-diverse individuals
experience higher rates of psychological distress, such as anxiety or depression,
when repeatedly misgendered [10, 4]. In healthcare and public services, misgen-
dering also contributes to reduced access and trust in institutions [1]. A nuanced
understanding of pronoun bias requires distinguishing among [9]:

— Binary pronouns: he/him/his/himself, she/her/hers/herself. These are
traditional gendered pronouns corresponding to the binary categories of male and
female. They are the most commonly represented in natural language corpora
and are widely understood both socially and computationally. Their extensive
usage has led to relatively high LLM accuracy in resolving and generating such
pronouns, but also to the reinforcement of gender stereotypes when models over-
associate certain roles or attributes with binary gender.

— Gender-neutral pronouns: singular they/them/their/theirs/themself. Orig-
inally used as a plural pronoun, “they has gained widespread acceptance in re-
cent decades as a singular pronoun to refer to individuals who identify outside
the male/female binary or whose gender is unknown or unspecified. Its growing
presence in inclusive writing guidelines (e.g., APA, MLA, and various journalistic
standards) reflects broader societal acceptance. Computationally, models often
struggle with ambiguity due to “they” functioning as both singular and plural,
posing challenges for co-reference resolution and context-aware generation.

— Neopronouns: emerging forms such as xe/xem/xyr/xyrs/xemself etc. Neopro-
nouns are recently coined or reclaimed pronoun forms created to offer alternatives
beyond the binary and traditional gender-neutral options. These are often used
by individuals who feel that existing pronouns do not adequately express their
identity. While valid and increasingly adopted in LGBTQ+ communities, they
remain rare in training corpora, leading to significantly lower performance in
LLMs. Their novel morphology and lack of frequency in common datasets also
result in tokenization and modeling difficulties.

A list of commonly used binary, gender-neutral, and neopronouns are listed
in Table 1. While binary pronouns are typically well-represented in training data
and handled reliably by NLP models, gender-neutral and neopronouns remain
rare-resulting in lower accuracy, inconsistency, and pronounced misgendering in
both technological and social contexts.

2.2. Pronoun Bias in LLMs

The issue of pronoun bias was first identified in earlier NLP systems that re-
lied heavily on syntactic and rule-based models. Studies of word embeddings

showed that societal stereotypes, such as the association of “man“ with “com-
puter programmer“ and “woman“ with “homemaker“, were deeply embedded in
vector space representations [3]. Benchmarks like WinoBias [29] and Winogen-
der [21] were subsequently introduced to test the fairness of coreference resolu-
tion systems. These datasets used parallel sentence structures with controlled
gender and occupation variables to expose models’ preference for stereotypical
gender assignments. Despite advancements in deep learning, transformer-based
large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, BERT, and T5 continue to exhibit
pronoun-related biases. These models are trained on massive web-scale corpora
that replicate societal imbalances, and they often default to binary pronouns in
ambiguous contexts. Furthermore, inclusive pronouns, especially neopronouns,
are frequently tokenized into subword fragments by byte pair encoding (BPE)
and similar schemes, impairing their representation in model inputs and out-
puts [17]. The MISGENDERED benchmark [9] was developed to evaluate LLMs
on their ability to correctly use declared pronouns in context, with a particular
focus on non-binary and neopronouns. The study revealed alarmingly low per-
formance on neopronouns in zero-shot settings, with accuracy dropping below
10%. Even gender-neutral pronouns like “they“ posed challenges, with models
misattributing or substituting them with binary alternatives.

3 The MISGENERDERED Benchmark

Overview and Motivation. The MISGENDERED benchmark [9] was devel-
oped to systematically evaluate how well LLMs respect and apply user-declared
pronouns, with a particular focus on gender-neutral and neopronoun usage. Mo-
tivated by growing concerns around misgendering and pronoun fidelity in gener-
ative language models, this benchmark addresses a critical fairness dimension in
responsible AI development. Prior studies had predominantly focused on binary
gender forms, leaving a significant gap in evaluating models on non-binary and
underrepresented identities. MISGENDERED aims to close this gap by pro-

viding a comprehensive testbed for probing LLM behavior under various gram-
matical and contextual conditions.

Task Design. Each test instance in MISGENDERED follows a structured
two-part format. The first sentence explicitly declares an individual’s pronouns
(e.g., “Aamari’s pronouns are re/rem/xyr/xyrs/zemself.”). The second sentence
presents a naturalistic context containing a masked placeholder [PRONOUN],
which the model is asked to fill in with the correct grammatical form. The
benchmark covers five grammatical forms, nominative, accusative, possessive-
dependent, possessive-independent, and reflexive, with ten distinct syntactic
templates per form. This diversity ensures coverage of various linguistic pat-
terns and co-reference scenarios encountered in real-world usage.

Dataset Construction. The MISGENDERED benchmark contains over 3.8
million templated instances, systematically designed to assess LLMs’ pronoun
fidelity across a diverse range of gender identities. These instances span three
primary pronoun categories: (1) Binary pronouns, (2) Gender-neutral pronouns,
and (3) Neopronouns, as detailed in Section 2. Each example begins with an ex-

plicit pronoun declaration, followed by a contextual sentence containing a masked
slot [PRONOUN] that the model is asked to complete appropriately. Templates
are manually constructed to span five core grammatical forms: nominative, ac-
cusative, possessive-dependent, possessive-independent, and reflexive. For each
grammatical form, ten natural-sounding sentence templates are authored and
instantiated across a pool of names categorized by gender association (male, fe-
male, and unisex). This generation process results in a high-coverage test set
that balances syntactic diversity with identity variation.

Example 1. Figure 1 illustrates representative input-output pairs for the neo-
pronoun set “xe/xem/xyr/xyrs/xemself,” covering all five grammatical forms.

Empirical Results and Limitations. As originally reported, LLM perfor-
mance varied significantly by pronoun type. Zero-shot prompting yielded approx-
imately 75.9% accuracy for binary pronouns, 31.0% for gender-neutral pronouns,
and only 7.6% for neopronouns. Few-shot prompting improved neopronoun accu-
racy to 45-65%, but gains plateaued beyond six examples, revealing limitations
in generalization. While MISGENDERED establishes a strong foundation for
pronoun-specific evaluation, it also exhibits notable limitations. It is narrowly fo-
cused on forward-generation accuracy, that is, filling in correct pronouns without
considering reverse tasks such as deducing identity from usage or disambiguating
competing pronoun candidates. Furthermore, while name diversity is incorpo-
rated, the benchmark does not explicitly evaluate gender-pronoun mismatches
or biases, limiting its scope in intersectional fairness analysis.

4 Benchmark Revisited - MISGENDERED+

To address the limitations of the original MISGENDERED benchmark and
support more comprehensive analysis of LLMs’ pronoun capabilities, we intro-
duce MISGENDERED4, an enhanced benchmark suite. This includes a novel
task, Gender Identity Inference, which evaluates whether LLMs can infer
gender identity from pronoun usage in context.

Gender Identity Inference Design. The Gender Identity Inference task
builds on methodologies from bias auditing research. Rather than asking models
to generate appropriate pronouns (as in forward prediction), this task reverses
the prompt: given a sentence containing a pronoun and a name, the model must
infer the most likely gender identity of the subject. This format allows us to iso-
late interpretive bias, probing whether a model can correctly respect the gender
implication of the pronoun used, even when name-based priors might conflict.
For instance, in the mismatched prompt “Alex was very emotional. Xe cried
loudly and often,” the correct answer is non-binary, despite the name "Alex"
often being interpreted as masculine. Conversely, matched prompts like “ Abigail
was very outgoing. She likes swimming” reinforce typical name-pronoun pairings.
Each test case requires the model to select exactly one of three options: A) Male,
B) Female, or C) Non-binary, and respond using only the corresponding letter.
This constraint avoids explanation leakage and emphasizes pure classification
behavior based on the pronoun signal.

Total 6600 6600 6600 19800

Table 2: Gender Identity Inference Data Size

Dataset. As shown in Table 2, the dataset comprises 19,800 instances, con-
structed by systematically varying pronoun type (male, female, neopronoun) and
name type (male, female, neutral). A group of instances is templated using 20
names and 30 sentence structures. Each category contains several groups of such
instances. Pronoun mismatches are intentionally introduced to challenge stereo-
typical associations. Matched combinations (e.g., female name with she/her)
provide baseline examples aligned with societal expectations. Mismatched com-
binations (e.g., male name with neopronoun) test whether models default to
name-based priors or appropriately respect the pronoun. The dataset is balanced
across all name types, enabling controlled comparative evaluation.

Evaluation Framework. Each instance follows a standard prompt structure.
Models are evaluated based on their ability to infer the correct identity label,
based on the pronoun used in the sentence, while intentionally disregarding any
gender implications.

Example 2. Figure 2 presents representative input examples from the Gender
Identity Inference task. In the first case, the model is given a sentence with a
traditionally masculine name (“Alex”) and a neopronoun (“Xe”) and is prompted
to choose the most likely gender identity. The correct answer is “C” (Non-binary),
as dictated by the pronoun, but the model incorrectly selects “A” (Male), reveal-
ing a bias toward name-based inference. In the second case, the sentence aligns
a feminine name (“Abigail”) with a she/her pronoun, forming a matched condi-
tion. The model correctly selects “B” (Female), demonstrating correct alignment
between pronoun usage and identity inference.

This task probes a different facet of pronoun handling than standard fill-
in-the-blank or coreference resolution tasks, it evaluates interpretive alignment
rather than syntactic generation. It also allows researchers to investigate re-
verse biases: whether models tend to override explicit pronoun cues in favor of
name-based heuristics. As such, the gender identity inference task offers a criti-
cal lens into model assumptions and implicit bias mechanisms, especially when
dealing with underrepresented or non-traditional pronoun forms. By contrasting
matched and mismatched outcomes across model families, we gain insight into
how robustly each model respects pronoun declarations and avoids stereotypical
mappings, a central concern for fairness in identity-related tasks.

5 Experiments and Results

5.1 Experimental Setup

We designed three complementary experiments to evaluate the fidelity and ro-
bustness of LLMs in pronoun handling tasks:

Zero-shot prompting: Each instance includes only a pronoun declaration (e.g.,
“Aamari’s pronouns are xe/xem/xyr/zyrs/cemself”) followed by a masked sen-
tence with [PRONOUN] as a placeholder. Models must infer the correct pronoun
form without additional examples.

Few-shot prompting: In addition to the declaration, contextual in-context exam-
ples are provided. The original MISGENDERED study experimented with 0,
2, 4, 6, 10 and 20 examples; however, accuracy improvements plateaued at 6
examples. By exposing the model to labeled examples, we aim to improve its
pronoun interpretation through in-context learning, simulating a low-resource
training scenario without explicit fine-tuning.

Gender Identity Inference: This reverse task requires models to predict the pro-
noun declaration from example usage patterns. To test model biases, we system-

atically construct enhanced gender identity inference part based on gendered
name associations and pronoun types. This experiment expands on MISGEN-
DERED by using an augmented dataset (MISGENDERED+) containing new
combinations designed to probe misattribution errors.

5.2 Models Evaluated

We evaluate five high-performance large language models (LLMs), encompassing
both proprietary and open-source architectures, to benchmark their performance
in inclusive pronoun handling:

— GPT-4o0 (OpenAI, 2025) [15] A multimodal flagship model from Ope-
nAI, GPT-4o is optimized for fast response time and high alignment quality. It
demonstrates strong generalization across a range of tasks and languages, with
excellent latency performance and reasoning capacity.

— Claude-4-Sonnet (Anthropic, 2025) [24] Designed with a safety-first
alignment philosophy, Claude-4-Sonnet excels in tasks requiring nuanced reason-
ing, human preference modeling, and ethical decision-making. It is well-suited
for applications where interpretability and value sensitivity are critical.

— Qwen2.5-72B (Alibaba, 2024) [27] A large-scale open-source LLM
with 72 billion parameters, Qwen2.5 is trained on diverse multilingual corpora
and instruction-tuned for general-purpose reasoning. It offers strong performance
on standard NLP benchmarks and is capable of effective in-context learning.

— Qwen-Turbo (Alibaba, 2025) [23] A smaller and more efficient sibling
of Qwen2.5, Qwen-Turbo is optimized for low latency and resource-constrained
environments. Despite its compact size, it performs well on common tasks and
is designed for real-time applications.

— DeepSeek-V3 (DeepSeek, 2025) [25] An open-source model designed
with multimodal extensions and a large-scale pretraining corpus. DeepSeek-V3
emphasizes efficiency and broad task coverage, although prior studies suggest it
may face limitations in specialized linguistic domains.

All models were accessed via their official APIs with model checkpoints up-
dated as of July 2025. To ensure consistency and reproducibility, our experiments
were deployed using an internal benchmarking service that automated querying,
decoding, logging, and evaluation workflows for all tested systems.

varies. GPT-4o and Claude-4-Sonnet already perform strongly in zero-shot set-
tings, but still show marginal gains with few-shot examples, particularly on less
common neopronouns. In contrast, models like DeepSeek-V3, Qwen-Turbo, and
Qwen2.5 exhibit substantial improvement when few-shot demonstrations are in-
troduced. GPT-4o performs consistently well across both settings. In zero-shot,
it achieves high accuracy on canonical pronouns (e.g., he: 96.3%, she: 95.2%,
they: 98.2%) and maintains over 95% accuracy across most neopronouns. With
few-shot prompting, performance further improves, reaching above 99% for they,
co, ey, and xe, with most neopronouns exceeding 97.5%.Claude also benefits from
few-shot prompting, especially on difficult pronouns. For instance, ze improves
from 99.4% to 100%, while rare pronouns such as thon and vi jump from 99%
to a perfect 100%. Zero-shot accuracy is already robust across all categories,
but few-shot examples help consolidate near-perfect consistency. DeepSeek-V3
demonstrates a dramatic disparity between zero-shot and few-shot conditions.
In zero-shot, performance is notably poor on both common and rare pronouns
(e.g., he: 21.0%, e: 1.4%, vi: 1.2%), indicating a limited ability to generalize
without examples. However, with few-shot prompting, DeepSeek-V3 drastically
improves across the board, achieving 99.7% on they, 97.3% on ze, and over 85%
on most other neopronouns. Qwen-Turbo shows moderate zero-shot capabilities
on binary pronouns (e.g., he, she) but struggles with neutrality and neopro-
nouns. For example, they drops to 64.4%, and rare forms like thon fall below
50%. In the few-shot setting, we observe improvements across all pronouns, with
ze reaching 87.6% and even the weakest pronouns (e.g., co, xe) climbing above
70%. Similar to DeepSeek, Qwen2.5 benefits noticeably from few-shot prompt-
ing. Accuracy on pronouns like they, ae, and ey increases from the 60-80% range
in zero-shot to 95-98% in few-shot. The model exhibits the most improvement
on neopronouns, especially co (74.5% — 95.5%) and ze (71.5% — 97.7%).

ical forms, nominative, accusative, possessive dependent, possessive independent,
and reflexive, under both zero-shot and few-shot conditions, as shown in Ta-
ble 5 and Table 6. In the zero-shot setting, frontier models such as GP'T-40 and
Claude-4-Sonnet demonstrate strong consistency across grammatical categories,
with average accuracy scores of 96.7% and 96.9%, respectively. However, their
performance shows slight variation across categories: GPT-4o drops to 90.4% on
reflexive forms, and Claude dips to 94.6% in the same category. Other models
like Qwen2.5 and Qwen-Turbo exhibit larger fluctuations. For example, Qwen-
Turbo achieves above 91% on nominative and accusative cases, but struggles
with possessive-independent (34.2%) and reflexive (52.0%) forms. DeepSeek-V3
performs particularly poorly under zero-shot, with overall average accuracy at
only 27.8%, and some categories like accusative as low as 17.4%. With few-shot
prompting, we observe significant gains across all models and grammatical types.
GPT-4o improves its reflexive handling from 90.4% to 98.7%, and maintains high
scores across other forms. DeepSeek-V3, which previously failed in zero-shot, now
reaches an average of 88.5%, closing the gap with stronger competitors. Qwen-
Turbo also improves from 66.9% to 73.6%, but continues to lag in possessive and
reflexive pronouns. Interestingly, few-shot prompting not only raises the floor for
underperforming models but also narrows performance gaps across grammatical
types. The average accuracy across all forms increases from 73.3% in zero-shot
to 89.8% in few-shot, highlighting the value of minimal supervision in helping
LLMs resolve syntactic complexity in gendered language. In conclusion, while
GPT-4o0 and Claude exhibit grammatical robustness in both conditions, few-
shot examples are particularly crucial for boosting lower-performing models and
achieving more balanced pronoun handling across grammatical forms.


An Updated Evaluation on Nonbinary Pronoun Handling in LLMs 13

Exp3 - Gender Identity Inference. Table 7 shows the result of our experi-
ment conducted for Gender Identity Inference task for five models. In this task,
we evaluate whether models can accurately infer a user’s declared pronouns
based solely on contextual usage. Each example contains a consistent usage
of a pronoun set (e.g., xe/cem/ryr/ryrs/cemself ) within naturalistic sentences,
and the model must choose the correct pronoun set from a candidate list. This
setup probes reverse inference and bias, especially for uncommon or mismatched
name-—pronoun combinations. As shown in the table 7, GPT-40 and Claude-4-
Sonnet exhibit near-perfect accuracy across all name—pronoun groupings. GPT-
4o achieves 100% accuracy for both match and mismatch sets, confirming its
robust context-to-pronoun generalisation. Claude-4-Sonnet follows closely with
95.6% on mismatch and 99.0% on match sets. Qwen2.5-72B performs well over-
all, attaining 81.2% on mismatched combinations and 98.1% on matched ones.
However, the smaller Qwen-Turbo model struggles with mismatches, highlight-
ing its susceptibility to name-pronoun co-occurrence bias. DeepSeek-V3 achieves
relatively strong mismatch generalisation and excellent performance on matched
cases, yet still lags behind GPT-4o on rare pronoun inference. In the breakdown
by name, gender, and class, most models perform best when given unisex names
(e.g., Alex, Taylor) and matched pronoun forms. For example, Qwen2.5-72B
and DeepSeek-V3 show over 99% accuracy for unisex name-pronoun matches,
but performance degrades on mismatched gendered pairs (e.g., male name with
feminine pronouns), revealing residual bias in name-to-gender priors. Overall, re-
sults indicate that modern LLMs can correctly back-infer pronoun declarations
with high accuracy in controlled prompts, though biases persist for less-aligned
or nontraditional associations. This validates name-prediction as a useful diag-
nostic for identity inference and model bias detection.

6 Discussion

6.1 Result Analysis

The results from Experiments 1 through 3 reveal clear stratification in model
capabilities across pronoun resolution, grammatical consistency, and gender iden-
tity inference. Across all three tasks, GPT-40 and Claude-4-Sonnet consistently
demonstrate superior performance, while open-source models like DeepSeek-V3
and Qwen variants lag behind, especially in zero-shot conditions.

Few-shot prompting as a performance equalizer. Few-shot prompting
dramatically improves model performance, particularly for those with weaker
baseline abilities. As for DeepSeek-V3 jumps from 21.0% on he to 77.9%, and
similar leaps occur across other neopronouns. This suggests that while some
models may lack robust zero-shot generalization, they retain latent syntactic
capabilities that can be activated with minimal context. For models like GPT-4o
and Claude-4, the improvements are less dramatic but still notable, reinforcing
their robustness across diverse input styles.

English pronoun usage, may stem from the nature of their training datasets.
Both models originate from organizations primarily focused on the multilingual
market, and it’s plausible that English data constitutes a smaller portion of
their pretraining corpora. Moreover, less investment in English-centric alignment
and inclusive language modeling may result in limited exposure to nonbinary
pronoun usage or syntactic nuance, hampering generalization in these tasks. This
hypothesis is supported by the stark contrast between their zero-shot and few-
shot performance, suggesting a capability that exists but remains unactivated
without explicit contextual cues.

Comparative Trends with the MISGENDERED Study. The earlier study
evaluated models such as ChatGPT (March 2023), Alpaca, and Flan-T5 on the
orgininal benchmark. Several notable trends emerge when comparing the 2023
and 2025 evaluations. First, the overall accuracy of LLMs on neopronouns has
significantly improved. In 2023, even the best-performing model (ChatGPT)
struggled with less common forms like ze/xem, ze/zir, and thon, achieving only
around 75% accuracy under zero-shot settings. By contrast, our 2025 evaluations
show that GPT-4o and Claude-4-Sonnet exceed 95% accuracy on nearly all neo-
pronouns, with several exceeding 99% under few-shot prompting.This reflects
stronger internalization of inclusive linguistic forms and better alignment with
gender-diverse usage. Second, grammatical consistency has also improved. Re-

flexive and possessive-dependent forms posed persistent challenges, with lower
accuracy across all tested models. Our results show that modern LLMs have
narrowed these gaps. For instance, GPT-4o achieves 98.7% accuracy on reflexive
forms and over 95% on possessive-dependent forms in the few-shot setting, out-
performing past models by a large margin. This indicates modern LLMs have
become significantly better at handling the structure and rules of how words
change and relate to each other in a sentence, especially for pronouns with differ-
ent grammatical forms. While earlier models struggled to handle rare pronouns
and mismatched contexts, today’s top-performing models exhibit near-human
performance, provided minimal contextual guidance. This underscores the im-
pact of larger model sizes, improved training datasets, and instruction tuning in
bridging representational fairness gaps in LLMs.

6.2 Future Directions

Remaining Gaps. Despite considerable advancements over prior work, in-
cluding improved zero-shot accuracy and higher consistency across binary and
gender-neutral pronouns, several critical gaps persist:

— Incomplete Generalization Across Pronoun Types: Leading models such as GPT-
4o and Claude 4 demonstrate strong performance on commonly used pronouns.
However, they still falter on less frequent neopronouns like xe/xem, ze/hir, and
novel invented forms. These gaps reflect the underrepresentation of such forms in
pretraining data and the limitations of tokenization-based learning, particularly
for rare or fragmented tokens.

— Name-Based Gender Heuristics Persist: In the reverse name-to-pronoun pre-
diction task, several models defaulted to binary pronouns based on stereotypical
gender associations of names, even when such predictions contradicted explicitly
declared or implied pronoun usage. This suggests that implicit social priors still
override context-aware reasoning in many LLMs.

— Ethical Incompleteness in Benchmark Design: Although the original MISGEN-
DERED benchmark was a major step forward, its structure did not require
explicit consent. Our MISGENDERED-+ variant improves this by mandating
pronoun declarations and including name—pronoun mismatches, but gaps in cov-
erage (e.g., intersectional identities, multilingual settings) remain.

Key Challenges. Building on the identified gaps, we outline three fundamental
challenges facing the development of gender-inclusive LLMs:

— Inclusive Data Scarcity: Collecting sufficiently diverse, high-quality, and context-
rich training data that includes inclusive pronoun usage, especially neopronouns
and nonbinary identity expressions, remains a significant challenge. These forms
are often underrepresented in mainstream corpora, leading to gaps in represen-
tation and limiting LLMs’ exposure.

— Evaluation Ambiguity: Measuring pronoun fidelity and inclusivity in LLMs is
inherently complex due to the lack of standardized metrics, context-sensitive



16 X. Tang et al.

interpretations, and overlapping grammatical and social cues. This makes it
challenging to reliably assess whether a model’s output is both syntactically
correct and socially respectful, especially in edge cases involving neopronouns or
ambiguous identity contexts.

Future Work. To advance the responsible development of inclusive language
models, we propose several research directions:

— Augmented Training with Inclusive Corpora: Future LLMs should be finetuned
or adapted using corpora enriched with gender-diverse, non-binary, and neopronoun-
inclusive narratives. Such data augmentation can mitigate exposure bias and
improve generalization to underrepresented forms.

— Probabilistic Pronoun Modeling: Inspired by Bayesian and non-parametric frame-
works, integrating dynamic pronoun preferences as learned distributions may
support better personalization and context adaptation. Models could be designed
to condition on user-declared identities with formal uncertainty representations.

— Community-Centered Evaluation and Co-Design: Inclusive benchmarks should
be built in collaboration with queer, trans, and non-binary communities. Crowd-
sourcing and participatory design can help ensure that metrics reflect lived expe-
rience and that systems are not only technically accurate but socially respectful.

Fairness Surveys in LLMs. Recent comprehensive surveys [12] systematically
categorise bias evaluation methods across multiple demographic dimensions, in-
cluding race, gender, religion, and socio-economic status. They highlight that
many evaluation strategies still inadequately address the spectrum of pronoun
diversity, especially where non-binary and neopronouns are concerned. This sur-
vey distinguishes between intrinsic fairness, bias inherent in model representa-
tions, and extrinsic fairness, manifested in downstream tasks. They argue that
even with debiasing interventions, underrepresented identities continue to suf-
fer disproportionately in open-ended generations and reasoning contexts. Simi-
larly, another study [8] provides a three-tier taxonomy (embeddings, probabil-
ities, text-generation) to evaluate bias and notes that most existing datasets
fail to adequately reflect gender diversity and pronoun usage. In addition, the
work [18] expands on these frameworks, offering a broader overview of bias types
and mitigation strategies across model scales, yet still lack targeted coverage of
pronoun robustness. Further study [7] introduces a multi-turn conversational
fairness benchmark, demonstrating how biases can accumulate across dialogue,
notably when pronouns are used, and yet it omits fine-grained pronoun diversity
evaluation.

Demographically Diverse Benchmarks. The work [22] introduced the Parity
Benchmark, which systematically evaluates LLMs across demographic attributes
such as gender, race, age, and ability. It employs controlled, balanced prompts to
assess model parity in responses; however, their benchmark design omits explicit


An Updated Evaluation on Nonbinary Pronoun Handling in LLMs 17

attention to pronoun diversity, especially non-binary and neopronouns. Futhere-
more, the CCSV-based diversity benchmarks [11] were proposed, analyzing how
LLMs self-critique and self-vote to improve demographic representation in gen-
erated lists (e.g. names or entities). While this benchmark explicitly measures
people diversity, it still does not examine whether models correctly adapt pro-
noun forms in discourse contexts. A study [19] complement this perspective with
DiversityMedQA, focusing on medical question answering across patient gender
and ethnicity. Their findings reveal significant performance disparities, under-
scoring that even domain-specific benchmarks must account for demographic
variation. Yet, similar to other studies, pronoun usage is treated only indirectly
through gender perturbations. Moreover, existing surveys and theoretical anal-
yses [5,13] highlight that benchmark effectiveness is contingent on capturing
data attributes like diversity, difficulty, and linguistic nuance. Pronoun diver-
sity remains a major blind spot in this context, even though benchmarks like
SoFa [14] begin to explore nuanced identity expressions. Overall, while these
benchmark efforts significantly improve our understanding of LLM fairness and
representation, they commonly omit fine-grained assessments of pronoun varia-
tion, particularly non-binary and neopronouns.

8 Conclusion

In this paper, we presented MISGENDERED-, an enhanced benchmark for
evaluating large language models (LLMs) on their ability to handle inclusive
pronoun usage. Building upon the original MISGENDERED framework, we in-
troduced new task designs and evaluated five recent LLMs, including both com-
mercial (GPT-40, Claude-4-Sonnet) and open-source (Qwen2.5, Qwen-Turbo,
DeepSeek-V3) models. Our results show that while modern aligned models have
significantly improved in handling gender-neutral and neopronouns, challenges
persist, particularly for open-source systems and in gender identity inference
tasks where name-based bias can mislead predictions. The benchmark reveals
key insights into how current LLMs process identity cues, highlights persistent
gaps in fairness under conditions of syntactic ambiguity and pronoun complexity,
and provides essential groundwork for further research into bias detection, inclu-
sive language generation, and the development of more equitable, accountable,
and socially responsible LLM systems worldwide.
