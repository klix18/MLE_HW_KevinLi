I may not be your typical Product Designer candidate, but here’s why you want me on your team.
At NBCUniversal, I was hired to manually create, duplicate, and rename 300 images per movie. Instead, I reimagined the process from a user’s perspective. With no prior Airtable experience, I taught myself the platform and built a fully automated, intuitive workflow using Airtable automations, Photoshop scripts, and shell commands — cutting task time from one hour to ten minutes.
For a large-scale NDA project with an urgent deadline of creating a functional workflow within 1 week, I applied the same principles — streamlining user flows, simplifying interfaces, and prioritizing clarity — and ultimately delivered 20,000+ assets in 30 days
with a 1.5% error rate across 19 operators. The system enabled asynchronous, cross-team collaboration while maintaining data integrity and compliance. Most importantly, it was easy to use. Colleagues described it as:
“Everything is pretty clear on my end.”
“Thanks again for your excellent work... you’re great at explaining it all and writing up consistent instructions!!”
“The training doc is extremely helpful... Makes it harder to forget any steps.”
These testimonials reflect my design philosophy: create simple and enjoyable systems that reduce friction, make complex workflows feel effortless, and empower users to focus on the work that matters.
Now, I’m expanding my skills into Agentic AI, training in fine- tuning, RAG, prompt engineering, MCP, and LangChain to
create AI-powered tools that autonomously manage and optimize workflows. I thrive in cross-functional environments, collaborating with engineers, product managers, and stakeholders to translate requirements into simple, polished, and highly usable solutions.
I’d welcome the chance to bring my passion for usability, my proven record in system design, and my drive for simplicity to your team at Whop — helping craft product experiences that set a new bar for excellence.
Best, Kevin Li
