# Week 4  

- Built different **RAG Pipelines**
  - **Langchain** Langchain has built in classes for embedding, indexing, etc. which makes the technical code much easier
  - **Python** You can also build the RAG pipeline using python from scratch, which allows more flexibility, but takes longer.
- HW_4_RAG_w_ARXIV is the main homework
