    "STEPWISER: STEPWISE GENERATIVE JUDGES FOR WISER REASONING Wei Xiong1,2, Wenting Zhao1, Weizhe Yuan1,3, Olga Golovneva1, Tong Zhang2, Jason Weston1,3, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar1 1FAIR at Meta, 2University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, 3NYU ABSTRACT As models increasingly leverage multi-step reasoning strategies to solve complex problems, supervising the logical validity of these intermediate steps has become a critical research challenge. Process reward models address this by providing step-by-step feedback, but current approaches have two major drawbacks: they typically function as classifiers without providing explanations, and their reliance on supervised fine-tuning with static datasets limits generalization. Inspired by recent advances, we reframe stepwise reward modeling from a classification task to a reasoning task itself. We thus propose a generative judge that reasons about the policy model\u2019s reasoning steps (i.e., meta-reasons), outputting thinking tokens before delivering a final verdict. Our model, STEPWISER, is trained by reinforce- ment learning using relative outcomes of rollouts. We show it provides (i) better judgment accuracy on intermediate steps than existing methods; (ii) can be used to improve the policy model at training time; and (iii) improves inference-time search. 1 INTRODUCTION As large language models (LLMs) increasingly tackle complex problems, they rely on multi-step reasoning strategies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) and ReAct (Yao et al., 2022) to decompose tasks and formulate better solutions. Consequently, ensuring these intermediate reasoning steps possess logical validity has become a critical research challenge. Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a potential tool to meet this need, providing step-by-step feedback for supervising learning, instead of relying on a single, often sparse, outcome-based reward (Lightman et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023). However, this approach suffers from two major drawbacks. First, current PRMs typically function as \u201cblack-box\u201d classifiers, providing a score or label without explaining why a step is correct or flawed. Second, their reliance on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with static datasets can limit their ability to generalize to new reasoning patterns (Lightman et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023; Xiong et al., 2024b; Zhang et al., 2024a). In contrast, reasoning models themselves are trained to produce CoTs with reinforcement learning (RL) for best performance (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025). In this paper we propose to reward intermediate reasoning steps by first reasoning about those reasoning steps, before making a judgment \u2013 a meta-reasoning process which itself is trained by RL. Our overall method (as shown in Figure 1) to build such a stepwise generative judge involves 3 components: (1) a new self-segmentation technique to equip the base policy model with the ability to produce coherent and informative reasoning chunks (chunks-of-thought); (2) assignment of target rewards to chunks via relative outcomes of rollouts; and (3) online training of judgment reasoning chains (i.e.,",

Our stepwise judge, termed STEPWISER, can then be used to provide rewards either at training time or inference time in order to improve the reasoning ability of the policy model. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our method across three key dimensions: (i) the judge\u2019s classification accuracy on intermediate steps, e.g., via its score on ProcessBench (Zheng et al., 2024); (ii) its performance in a new inference-time search paradigm where the judge cleans up the reasoning history and re-samples \u2013 a method we propose for efficiently scaling sequential computation while maintaining the original generation length; and (iii) its utility in data selection for downstream model training.

To improve the reliability of multi-step reasoning in LLMs, one can consider methods beyond evaluating only the final answer \u2013 an approach known as Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) \u2013 to evaluating each intermediate step, a method pioneered by Process Reward Models (PRMs).

    "final answer \u2013 an approach known as Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) \u2013 to evaluating each intermediate step, a method pioneered by Process Reward Models (PRMs). Lightman et al. (2023) first demonstrated that a process-supervised model can significantly outperform an outcome-supervised one in guiding best-of-n sampling. However, their PRM800K dataset relied on intensive human annotation for each reasoning step, which is generally infeasible for larger, more diverse and challenging datasets. Subsequent research has focused on automating this annotation process. Wang et al. (2023) proposed using Monte Carlo (MC) rollouts to estimate the Q-value of each step, while Luo et al. (2024) introduces a binary search method to efficiently identify faulty steps. Our work builds upon the MC-based annotation approach, exploring various methods for converting these Q-value estimates into effective learning signals. In parallel, another line of work has established a theoretical connection between intermediate step values and the final outcome within the framework of KL-regularized Markov Decision Processes (Zhong et al., 2024; Rafailov et al., 2024). This result has been used to derive DPO-like objectives for learning an implicit PRM from outcome-only data (Xiong et al., 2024a; Cui et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2025) or a KL-regularized version of the MC-based estimator (Zhang et al., 2024a). A recent work (Zha et al., 2025) prompts LLMs to evaluate each individual step before producing a final judgment, but supervises only the evaluation of the final answer. These methods share the goal of learning a stepwise judge from sparse signals. The major advantage of this line of work is that it is easy to train the judge in an online manner. A central question, which our work addresses, is whether the rich, explicit signals from extensive Monte Carlo sampling provide a more effective learning signals for RL-based reward training. Concurrent work by He et al. (2025) uses a prompting approach to segment thought process into coherent chunks similar to ours. However, their stepwise judge is based only on prompting techniques 2 that leverages hints in CoT like \u201dWait, I made a mistake\u201d. In contrast, our method focuses on training a judge using stepwise labels grounded in final verified answers. 2.2 JUDGE ARCHITECTURES The process rewards described above can be used to train judges with different distinct architectures and training paradigms. Discriminative PRMs The most straightforward approach is to treat the task as a classification problem. This involves replacing the language model\u2019s final layer with a linear head and fine-tuning it to predict a binary label for each step using a cross-entropy loss (Lightman et al., 2023). A more recent method formulates the task as next-token prediction, prompting the LLM to generate a pre-defined token (e.g., + or -) as its judgment (Wang et",

A more recent method formulates the task as next-token prediction, prompting the LLM to generate a pre-defined token (e.g., + or -) as its judgment (Wang et al., 2023; Xiong et al., 2024b). This approach further dates back to preference reward model training (Dong et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Although this method uses a generative mechanism, its function remains purely discriminative, as it outputs a simple judgment without justification. We therefore group both under the discriminative category. Generative judges with CoT reasoning In sharp contrast, the second and most recent paradigm is the generative reasoning judge. Here, the evaluation itself is framed as a reasoning task. The judge first generates an explicit CoT to explain its rationale before outputting its final judgment. This approach was initially explored for preference learning and ORMs (Zhang et al., 2024b; Chen et al., 2025). There are also a few very recent works studying this paradigm shift in the context of stepwise judges, including Zhao et al. (2025); Zha et al. (2025); Khalifa et al. (2025). Though we share similar spirit of leveraging the inherent reasoning ability of the LLMs to train a stepwise judge, the algorithmic designs are distinctly different. In contrast to Zhao et al. (2025) and Khalifa et al. (2025), who focus on offline rejection sampling fine-tuning, our investigation shows that such static training methods suffer from scalability issues, where the performance quickly stagnates after the initial few steps. In contrast, we cast the stepwise judgment as a reasoning task, and focus on online RL training. Zha et al. (2025) do use RL, but with sparse, trajectory-level supervision. Specifically, they prompt the LLMs to evaluate each individual step and final answer but only the final verification is supervised. Their approach assumes that to get an accurate evaluation of the final answer, models implicitly become an stepwise judge. In contrast, our framework is built on dense, stepwise supervision via rollouts. Our experiments will show that this explicit, online, stepwise signal is critical for training state-of-the-art generative judges. 3 METHOD: TRAINING STEPWISE GENERATIVE JUDGES WITH RL As depicted in Figure 1, our overall method STEPWISER consists of three components: \u2022 We equip the base policy model with the ability to self-segment Chain-of-Thoughts into coherent and informative reasoning chunks, called Chunks-of-Thought. This is done by creating SFT data with informative segments, so that the model can be trained to self- segment. We show that this causes no loss in performance for the base model. \u2022 Given the chunks generated by the policy model, we annotate each chunk to create training",

We show that this causes no loss in performance for the base model. \u2022 Given the chunks generated by the policy model, we annotate each chunk to create training data for our generative stepwise judge with binary target labels. This is done by comparing outcomes of rollouts starting before and after the given chunk using the outcome rewards. \u2022 We perform online RL training using GRPO which trains our stepwise judge model to produce judgment reasoning chains (i.e., reasoning about reasoning) and reward final judgments that match the chunk labels from the previous step. We describe the three components in detail in the following three subsections. 3.1 COT GENERATION WITH SELF-SEGMENTATION (CHUNKS-OF-THOUGHT) To train judges that can evaluate individual steps in a reasoning process, a key challenge is defining what a \u201cstep\u201d is. While CoT reasoning enables models to reason step by step, properly segmenting this reasoning remains a difficult problem. 3 Table 1: Rules that we provide for an LLM to create segmented Chunks-of-Thought SFT data. Rules for CoT Trajectory Segmentation Segmentation Principles 1. Unified purpose: A chunk should serve a single, clear objective. For example: setting up an initial equation, executing a self-contained calculation (like integration by parts), or stating a final/intermediate conclusion. All content within the chunk must directly serve this one core goal. 2. Logical Cohesion: All lines within a chunk must form a continuous and uninterrupted logical flow. A new chunk should begin as soon as the focus or purpose of the reasoning shifts. 3. Clear Transition: A new chunk must begin when the problem-solving process enters a new phase. This includes transitioning from \u201dsolving for a variable\u201d to \u201dverifying the answer,\u201d or inserting an \u201dexplanatory side-note\u201d into the main workflow. Format rules. 1. Use <chunk>... </chunk> to mark the beginning and end of each segment. The text and newlines inside the tags must not be altered. 2. The final output should only contain the tagged content, without any additional text, titles, or blank lines. 3. You must preserve all original text and newlines exactly as they appear within the tags. Current methods often segment reasoning trajectories using pre-defined tokens, like \u201cStep 1, Step 2\u201d or simply using double line breaks as delimiters. However, these heuristics frequently result in segments that are neither logically complete nor self-contained. Each segment contains only limited information, making it unsuitable as a standalone unit for a judge model to evaluate effectively. We present a representative example in Table 2, where the model tends to insert double line breaks before and after a mathematical equation. This breaks an intuitively",

We present a representative example in Table 2, where the model tends to insert double line breaks before and after a mathematical equation. This breaks an intuitively unified logical step into three different chunks, where one chunk contains a textual explanation, and the next with the corresponding equation. Achieving better step definition via self-segmentation. To mitigate this issue, we propose a method to teach the model to generate and simultaneously self-segment its own reasoning chains into more meaningful steps. First, we define the criteria for a high-quality reasoning step. The core idea is that each step should represent a complete logical leap or a self-contained part of the problem-solving process. Our definitions are given in Table 1. We then We then create our training data by: 1. Generating a set of initial reasoning trajectories from the base model. 2. Using an LLM prompted with our rules, to automatically segment these trajectories into logically coherent steps. 3.2 STEPWISE DATA ANNOTATION Stepwise data annotation via Q value estimation. Previous work has used human labelers to annotate correctness of each reasoning step (Lightman et al., 2023), although most such data is collected for proprietary models that we cannot access. Other works annotate steps automatically using methods like Monte Carlo estimation (Wang et al., 2023). We follow this second approach, using an estimated Q-value to measure the quality of each step. For a given training prompt x with verifiable outcome rewards, we generate a response from our policy model \u03c0 which segments its CoT into chunks a = [a1, a2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , aH], where ai is the i-th reasoning chunk. Then, the Q value of an individual step ai and its history is the expected final reward starting from that point: Q\u03c0\u0000[x, a1:i\u22121], ai \u0001 := Q\u03c0(si\u22121, ai) = Eai+1:H\u223c\u03c0(\u00b7|x,a1:i)r\u22c6(x, a1:H), (1) where si := [x, a1:i\u22121] is the history, and r\u22c6is a final reward, which can be 1 for correct answers and 0 otherwise. We estimate this Q-value by generating M full completions aj i+1:H from that step ai 4 Table 2: A representative example illustrating CoT segmentation methods based on a response from Qwen2.5-1.5B-it. Standard splitting by newlines (left) results in too many chunks, often separating textual explanations from their corresponding mathematical equations. In contrast, our self-segmentation approach (right) yields more coherent and meaningful chunks, with a clear, self- contained purpose\u2014simplifying the second term in the previously established equation (note that the summary of this goal is for illustration and not generated by the model).

Since z2 + 4i \u22123 = x2 \u2212y2 + 2xyi + 4i \u22123 = (x2 \u2212y2 \u2212 3) + (2xy + 4)i, we get: z \u2212i + 2 = x + (y \u22121) = x + yi \u2212i + 2 = (x + 2) + yi. Using the same logic as above, the magnitude is: q\u0000x2 \u2212y2 \u22123 + x + y + 2 \u00012 + (2xy + 4 + x + y)2 = q\u0000x2 \u2212y2 \u22121 + x + y \u00012 + (2xy + x + y + 4)2. and calculating the average final reward, i.e. the ratio of correct final answers: bQ\u03c0\u0000si\u22121, ai \u0001 = 1 M M X j=1 r\u22c6(x, a1:i, aj i+1:H). (2) Following prior work (Wang et al., 2023; Xiong et al., 2024b), we can then assign a binary label to the step based on this Q-value: yi = ( + if bQ\u03c0\u0000si\u22121, ai \u0001 > 0, \u2212 if bQ\u03c0\u0000si\u22121, ai \u0001 = 0. For convenience, we refer to this labeling approach as Absolute Q value thresholding (Abs-Q). Rewarding the progress. One drawback of Abs-Q is its insensitivity to the dynamics of the reasoning process. For instance, it does not differentiate between a step that raises the success probability from 10% to 50% and one that drops it from 60% to 55%. To reward progress, we also explore methods that consider the change in Q-value. Setlur et al. (2024) proposes to consider the change in value. Specifically, they define the notion of",
    "a step that raises the success probability from 10% to 50% and one that drops it from 60% to 55%. To reward progress, we also explore methods that consider the change in Q-value. Setlur et al. (2024) proposes to consider the change in value. Specifically, they define the notion of effective reward as a combination of Q value and advantage function of the best-of-n policy induced by r\u22c6: Q\u03c0(si\u22121, ai) + \u03b1 \u00b7 A\u00b5(si\u22121, ai), (3) where \u03b1 > 0 is a hyperparameter, and A\u00b5(si\u22121, ai) := Q\u00b5(si\u22121, ai) \u2212Q\u00b5(si\u22122, ai\u22121). Here \u00b5 is taken as the best-of-n policy with r\u22c6. In other words, we generate n responses from \u03c0 and use r\u22c6to select the best one. In this case, \u00b5 satisfies that Q\u00b5(si\u22121, ai) = 1 \u2212(1 \u2212Q\u03c0(si\u22121, ai))n. Therefore, the effective reward can also be estimated via Q value estimation. Accordingly, we consider an alternative approach of data annotation: yi = ( + if bQ\u03c0\u0000si\u22121, ai \u0001 + \u03b1 \u00b7 bA\u00b5\u0000si\u22121, ai \u0001 > 0, \u2212 if bQ\u03c0\u0000si\u22121, ai \u0001 + \u03b1 \u00b7 bA\u00b5\u0000si\u22121, ai \u0001 = 0. 5 We refer to this labeling approach as Relative Effective Reward Thresholding (Rel-Effective). As a simpler alternative to capture relative improvement, we also consider a method based on the value ratio, where the label is determined as: yi = ( + if bQ\u03c0\u0000si\u22121, ai \u0001 / bQ\u03c0\u0000si\u22122, ai\u22121 \u0001 > \u03b3, \u2212 if bQ\u03c0\u0000si\u22121, ai \u0001 / bQ\u03c0\u0000si\u22122, ai\u22121 \u0001 \u2264\u03b3. Here \u03b3 > 0 is a threshold and we refer this labeling approach as Rel-Ratio. Using one of these methods, we can assign binary label yi to every step ai in a reasoning trajectory. Since these labels come from unbiased estimates of the actual Q-values, they are likely to be more reliable compared to more ad-hoc methods. For example, if a step ai is the first step with a mistake, rollouts starting after ai are more likely to fail compared to ones that start before the flawed step ai. 3.3 TRAINING THE JUDGE VIA RL At this stage we now have the recipe to create segmented (chunked) reasoning chains, each with a stepwise target label, across our training data. A straightforward approach would be to train a judge model as a classifier using standard SFT, as done in prior works (Wang et al., 2023; Xiong et al., 2024b). However, recent studies suggest that a more robust and effective judge can be created by having it generate its own CoT analysis to evaluate the models\u2019 responses (Zhang et al., 2024b; Chen et al., 2025; Whitehouse et al., 2025). In the meantime, this generative formulation naturally allows us to train the judge via reinforcement learning. We therefore frame the stepwise evaluation",

In the meantime, this generative formulation naturally allows us to train the judge via reinforcement learning. We therefore frame the stepwise evaluation as a reasoning task where the judge model first generates an analytical rationale and then concludes with a final judgment. This approach is compelling also because it forces the judge to \u201cshow its work\u201d, providing a more transparent and potentially more accurate evaluation process. Task formulation and prompt dataset balancing. We decompose the full trajectories into step- level training prompts. For each training prompt, the model is provided with the original problem x, the reasoning history a1:i\u22121, and the new reasoning chunk ai to be evaluated. The model is prompted to generate its own Cot reasoning about the correctness of the step ai, followed by a final judgment in a predefined format (e.g., enclosed in a box). Such CoT reasoning in the judge allows it to spend more compute and perform thorough analysis of a reasoning step ai, which is likely necessary given ai itself is a part of CoT that performs non-trivial reasoning. See Table 3 for the prompt template used. A critical but often overlooked aspect of the stepwise judge training is that the stepwise labels can be highly imbalanced due to the data annotation process in Section 3.2. For example, with the Qwen2.5- 1.5B-chunk model, 70.2% of Abs-Q samples are labeled as correct. In our early experiments, we observe that these imbalanced prompt set can cause model degeneration, as the model can achieve a high score by simply predicting \u201ccorrect\u201d in most cases. To mitigate this, we make prompt dataset balancing an explicit part of our method: we down-sample the majority class so that the numbers of positive and negative prompts are equal. We find this balancing step to be essential for stable RL training, as it ensures the reward signal reflects the model\u2019s discriminative ability rather than class frequency bias. We will study its impacts on the final model performance in Section 4.3. Reward and RL training. The training signal for RL is direct and intuitive. For each step ai, the judge model receives a reward of 1 if its judgment aligns with the label yi (created by Monte-Carlo estimations), and 0 otherwise. We use GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) as our optimization algorithm due to its demonstrated effectiveness across multiple studies (Shao et al., 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025). 4 EXPERIMENTS 4.1 EXPERIMENT SETUP Model and data.

Before training, we preprocess the dataset by first removing duplicate prompts. We then use Math-Verify to extract the final answer from each reference solution and score it against the labeled ground truth. We discard any prompts where Math-Verify cannot successfully verify the answer. Unless otherwise specified, we focus on using the same base model to initialize both the policy and the judge. We will also conduct experiments to study how the choice of base model affects the judge\u2019s evaluation ability. Self-segmentation fine-tuning.

After self-segmentation fine-tuning, the resulting models achieve comparable or slightly better test accuracy on MATH500, while maintaining similar response lengths. Notably, the number of steps decreases significantly compared to commonly used splitting by \\n\\n, from 9.6 to 6.0 with 1.5B model and from 9.9 to 6.8 with the 7B model, suggesting that the models generate responses in a more organized and structured manner. An illustrative example is shown in Table 2, and additional case studies can be found in the Appendix. Meanwhile, we observe that for most current open-source thinking models that do long reasoning before answering, the number of steps exceeds 150 when trajectories are segmented 2https://github.com/axolotl-ai-cloud 7 Table 4: Comparison of the base policy with and without self-segmentation fine-tuning. Overall performance is comparable, but self-segmentation results in less chunks than using split by \\n \\n. Here Avg@32 is the test accuracy averaged over 32 trajectories with random seeds.

Due to resource constraints, we do not experiment with these thinking models. However, we expect that our self-segmentation technique would be particularly beneficial in this setting, which we leave for future exploration. Stepwise data annotation. We select a subset of 40k prompts from NuminaMath for stepwise data annotation based on a pre-filtering process using the pass@k metric. Specifically, for each prompt, we generate 16 responses using our chunk-tuned models (e.g., Qwen2.5-1.5B-chunk). To ensure the selected prompts are of a suitable difficulty, we filter out prompts where the responses were either all correct or all incorrect. During generation, we use a temperature of 1.0 and set the maximum token limit to",
    "prompt, we generate 16 responses using our chunk-tuned models (e.g., Qwen2.5-1.5B-chunk). To ensure the selected prompts are of a suitable difficulty, we filter out prompts where the responses were either all correct or all incorrect. During generation, we use a temperature of 1.0 and set the maximum token limit to 8192, or until the model produced a final answer. Then, for each intermediate step in a solution, we sample another M = 16 completions staring from that step for estimating Q-values, as specified in Equation 2. The intermediate labels are then assigned according to the methods described in Section 3.2. Here we mainly follow the annotation framework from previous literature (Wang et al., 2023; Xiong et al., 2024b), which is well-suited to our specific research questions. While advanced engineering\u2014such as employing model ensembles for generation or using powerful LLMs/human for label verification (Zhang et al., 2025)\u2014may enhance results, these engineering strategies are orthogonal to our main contribution, and we believe they could be integrated for future improvements. The data annotation takes approximately 14 days on 8 A100 GPUs using Qwen2.5-7B-chunk model, making it computationally expensive. We notice that self-segmentation fine-tuning significantly reduces the number of chunks during trajectory splitting, thereby saving substantial compute and annotation time. We also present additional ablation results with and without chunking in Appendix A.3. Judge RL training details. We implement the GRPO algorithm using the verl library (Sheng et al., 2024). During each training step, we use a per-prompt batch size of 1024 and a gradient update mini-batch size of 256. For the GRPO training process, the judge model generates 4 responses for each prompt. The maximum prompt length is set to 3096 tokens, and the model can generate up to 3096 new tokens. The learning rate is set to 1e \u22126. In our initial experiments, we observe that the model\u2019s entropy decreases rapidly, particularly for the 7B model. Since our verification task is a binary classification (correct/incorrect), low entropy causes the model to generate 4 responses with identical final judgments. This leads to zero gradients during the GRPO update, causing performance to get stuck after approximately 200 training steps. To mitigate this issue, we adopt the clip higher technique (Yu et al., 2025), using \u03f5h = 0.28 and \u03f5l = 0.2. We expect that more advanced methods, such as those proposed by Lanchantin et al. (2025), could further alleviate this issue. We apply a heuristic filtering process to remove prompts that were overly short or excessively long. Additionally, we find that our threshold-based labeling method often results in an imbalance between positive and negative examples. Therefore, we down-sample the majority class to create a balanced training set to stabilize training. We will also include",

Additionally, we find that our threshold-based labeling method often results in an imbalance between positive and negative examples. Therefore, we down-sample the majority class to create a balanced training set to stabilize training. We will also include an ablation study on this process. We run the training for 800 steps, which takes approximately 5 days on 8 A100 GPUs (for Qwen2.5- 7B-chunk models). We present a typical reward curve and an entropy loss curve in Appendix Figure 4. 8 4.2 EVALUATION ON PROCESSBENCH We first evaluate our method STEPWISER on ProcessBench (Zheng et al., 2024), a benchmark designed to test the ability to identify the first incorrect step in a reasoning trajectory, as labeled by human annotators. The benchmark contains 3500 problem-solution pairs from diverse math datasets (GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021), Olympiad Bench (He et al., 2024a), and Omni-MATH (Gao et al., 2024)). Performance is measured by the harmonic mean3 of the accuracy on problems with correct final answers acc1 and those with incorrect final answers acc2, calculated as: 2 \u00d7 acc1 \u00d7 acc2 acc1 + acc2 . (4) Our RL-trained STEPWISER judge significantly outperforms SFT-trained discriminative judges Our primary results on ProcessBench are presented in Table 5. The findings show that our RL-trained STEPWISER judge significantly outperforms all variants of the SFT-trained discriminative judge. This holds true across all learning signals (Abs-Q, Rel-Ratio, Rel-Effective) and model scales. For instance, on the 7B model with the Rel-Effective signal, STEPWISER achieves an average score of 61.9, far surpassing the discriminative baseline\u2019s 39.7. This demonstrates that combining explicit reasoning generation with online RL training is a more effective strategy. As a reference, we also include several models from the open-source community that adopt similar discriminative training pipelines. These include model Math-Shepherd-PRM-7B (Wang et al., 2023), based on Mistral-7B, and RLHFlow-Llama3-8B-it (Xiong et al., 2024b), and Skywork-Qwen2.5- Math-7B-it (He et al., 2024b). Notably, the performance of these community-trained models is worse or comparable to that of our reproduced SFT-trained discriminative judge, and they similarly lag far behind our RL-trained STEPWISER judge. Therefore, we conclude that the stepwise judge benefits from our proposed recipe of explicit reasoning traces and online reward optimization by RL. Our RL-trained STEPWISER judge significantly outperforms existing RL-trained judges Fur- thermore, we benchmark STEPWISER against other models trained with online methods like online DPO (Xiong et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023) or GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) (e.g., Eurus-7B, RL-TANGO- 7B). Unlike our method, these models are supervised at the trajectory level, using only the final answer\u2019s correctness as a reward signal, denoted by \u201cOutcome\u201d in Table 5. STEPWISER models,",
    "like online DPO (Xiong et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023) or GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) (e.g., Eurus-7B, RL-TANGO- 7B). Unlike our method, these models are supervised at the trajectory level, using only the final answer\u2019s correctness as a reward signal, denoted by \u201cOutcome\u201d in Table 5. STEPWISER models, which are trained on explicit step-level signals from Monte-Carlo estimation, also surpass these baselines by a large margin. For example, our best 7B model scores 61.9 while RL-TANGO scores 43.9. This result strongly suggests that direct, step-level supervision provides a much richer and more effective learning signal than a sparse, outcome-only reward. Test-time compute scaling via majority voting. Since STEPWISER perform evaluation via CoT reasoning, a natural extension is to generate multiple judgments and use majority voting to decide the final judgment. We apply majority voting with the Qwen2.5-7B-chunk model, and the results are presented in Table 5. We can see that the majority voting shows consistent improvements in the Processbench score across various labeling methods. However, the overall gain from majority voting is modest compared to what is often observed in standard mathematical reasoning tasks. We hypothesize this is because our evaluation at each step is binary (correct vs. incorrect), resulting in a much narrower output space than the richer answer spaces typical in math reasoning. In such broader tasks, majority voting is more effective at reducing noise and improving robustness. In contrast, the binary nature of our judgments limits the potential benefit from aggregating multiple outputs. 4.3 ANALYSIS OF THE PERFORMANCE GAP To better understand the source of the performance gap observed on ProcessBench, we isolate the contribution of each component by comparing STEPWISER against three specialized baselines: \u2022 Ablate RL. A STEPWISER judge trained with rejection sampling fine-tuning (RS-FT, offline): We fine-tune the base model on a static dataset created via rejection sampling, a common offline approach. This isolates the effect of using the CoT format without online RL. 3Note that while this score was referred to as the F1 score in the original paper, it is different from the standard F1 score. 9 Table 5: ProcessBench results. The score of each subset is computed via Equation 4. Average accuracy (Avg) of our method STEPWISER is better than all variants of our discriminative baselines, and existing baselines in the literature (first rows).

Right: the training loss of rejection sampling fine-tuning, which saturates quickly. baseline. On ProcessBench results with Qwen2.5-1.5B-chunk model, the RS-FT model achieves an average score of only 23.1, which is substantially lower than STEPWISER\u2019s score of 36.2 and is even worse than the standard discriminative SFT baseline (24.1). To understand this phenomena, we plot the loss curve of rejection sampling fine-tuning in Figure 2 (right). We notice that its training loss on a large, static dataset plateaus quickly. This trend is consistent with other learning signals and the larger 7B model, indicating that offline methods are insufficient to capture the complexity of CoT reasoning and reward modeling, making online RL a critical component. STEPWISER judges with CoT leverage the intrinsic reasoning ability to obtain better evaluation. The benefit of the generative CoT format is illustrated by the \u201cNo CoT\u201d baseline. With Qwen2.5-1.5B- chunk model, augmenting a discriminative-style judge with RL boosts the ProcessBench score from 24.1 (SFT) to 34.3 (RL), but it still falls short of STEPWISER\u2019s 36.2. Moreover, the in-distribution accuracy results in Figure 2 (left) show that STEPWISER with CoT reasoning achieves higher accuracy on the held-out data. This suggests that generating explicit rationales provides a more expressive and informative structure for learning and modeling the stepwise reward signal. The gap between the generative CoT model and the discriminative model becomes much larger with the stronger Qwen2.5-7B-chunk. Specifically, the generative STEPWISER admits an average score of 60.5, while the discriminative only achieves 47.9.

    "The gap between the generative CoT model and the discriminative model becomes much larger with the stronger Qwen2.5-7B-chunk. Specifically, the generative STEPWISER admits an average score of 60.5, while the discriminative only achieves 47.9. This is because we are leveraging the intrinsic reasoning ability of the base model through CoT in the judgment so the stronger model offers more advantages. Prompt dataset balancing stabilizes training and mitigate overfitting. The practice of balancing the prompt dataset is also crucial for robust performance. Our ablation study on the Qwen2.5-7B- chunk model shows that removing this balancing step causes a substantial performance drop, with the average ProcessBench score drops from 60.5 to 47.9. A deeper analysis reveals that while both the \u201cNo CoT\u201d ablation and the lack of dataset balancing hurt performance, their underlying failure modes are different. The \u201cNo CoT\u201d model suffers from a general decline in its ability to recognize correct and incorrect steps. In contrast, without balancing, the prompt dataset is heavily biased towards positive examples. This trains the model to be overly optimistic, developing a strong bias towards predicting any given step as correct. This bias is particularly enhanced during online training. This eventually leads to training instability and model collapse. A detailed analysis of this phenomenon is provided in the Appendix A.4. 4.4 USING STEPWISER JUDGE TO OBTAIN BETTER SOLUTIONS In this section, we evaluate the practical utility of our RL-trained STEPWISER judge in two common applications: guiding an LLM\u2019s reasoning process at inference time and selecting high-quality data for subsequent fine-tuning. 11 Table 7: Inference time search via Chunk-Reset Reasoning. We report results with both Qwen2.5- 1.5B-chunk and Qwen2.5-7B-chunk, using them as both the response generators and the initialization checkpoints for the STEPWISER judge. We see clear improvements using STEPWISER judge across both model sizes, with similar accepted responses lengths (on MATH500). Rejected length is the number of tokens in removed chunks during inference time search.

Inference-Time Search via Chunk-Reset Reasoning To leverage STEPWISER judge for improved reasoning, we employ an inference-time search strategy. The base policy model generates a solution \u201cchunk-by-chunk\u201d. After each chunk is produced, STEPWISER judge evaluates it. If the chunk is considered to be good, it is accepted, and the model proceeds to the next step. If it is rejected, the flawed chunk is discarded, and the model re-generates a new one from the same point (up to 5 attempts). This allows the model to self-correct and explore alternative reasoning paths without committing to an early mistake, enhancing the final solution\u2019s quality. Meanwhile, this reasoning paradigm allows for scaling sequential compute (i.e., the compute used to extend a single inference trajectory with additional steps, rather than running many independent trajectories in parallel), while the overall number of accepted tokens remains similar. 2. Training Data Selection via Stepwise Rejection Sampling Fine-tuning. Rejection Sam- pling Fine-tuning (Dong et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023) is a standard technique to improve a base policy by fine-tuning it on its own best outputs. The high-level intuition is that, when the models are allowed to generate N responses per prompt, the pass@N is usually much higher than the random one (pass@1). Therefore, we can use a proxy reward model to select a training set from the self-generated responses, and train on this set to improve the base policy. However, for mathematical reasoning, verifying only the final answer provides a coarse, binary signal (correct/incorrect) that struggles to differentiate between multiple correct solutions. Here we use STEPWISER judge to compute the scores for each individual reasoning chunk, and use the average score as a proxy to pick the best response. The results for inference-time search and data selection are presented in Table 7 and Table 8, respectively. We summarize the key findings below. Consistent performance improvements in both setups In both applications, using our STEP- WISER judge leads to superior outcomes. For inference time search (Table 7), with the Rel-Ratio learning signal, our approach guides the 1.5B model to achieve an average accuracy of 36.9%, a significant improvement over the 31.2% of the base model. We also see clear trends of STEPWISER model being superior to the disciminative models across all learning signals. This trend holds for the 7B model, demonstrating the scalability",

We also see clear trends of STEPWISER model being superior to the disciminative models across all learning signals. This trend holds for the 7B model, demonstrating the scalability of our method. Similarly, when used for data selection (Table 8), models fine-tuned on data selected by STEPWISER judge achieve the highest performance (63.0%), surpassing the original base model (60.1%), as well as data selected by a discriminative judge (61.9%) or outcome-based selection (60.9%). 12 Table 8: Data selection via Stepwise Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning.

However, the \u201cRejected Length\u201d column, which corresponds to chunks that judged to be flawed, indicates that our model generates more total tokens to arrive at its final answer. We interpret this as direct evidence of STEPWISER\u2019s superior ability to identify incorrect or unproductive steps. This triggers the reset mechanism more effectively, forcing the model to discard flawed reasoning and find a better path. This is also consistent with the higher accuracy of identifying the error step on ProcessBench (see also Table 10 in the appendix). Relative signals are more effective for assigning chunk labels. We also observe that across both tables, training signals that reward relative progress (Rel-Effective, Rel-Ratio) consis- tently yield better judges than a signal that only measures a step\u2019s absolute quality (Abs-Q). This appears to be consistent across all results in the paper, for all model sizes and evaluation setups. For example, in inference time search, the Rel-Effective judge achieves a 64.3% average accuracy, outperforming the Abs-Q judge (61.9%). This pattern is also confirmed in data selection, where the Rel-Effective judge produces the best fine-tuning dataset, leading to a final model with 63.0% accuracy, again surpassing the Abs-Q judge (62.5%). 5 CONCLUSION Reasoning models that output internal thought tokens before a final response have proven to outper- form non-reasoning models.

In this paper we have shown that further improvements can be found by making models reason about the reasoning decisions made within those internal thoughts. We provide a recipe to: (1) segment reasoning into chunks-of-thought; (2) assign rewards to chunks via relative outcomes of rollouts; and (3) train a judge model to reason about the quality of CoT chunks via reinforcement learning (RL). Our stepwise generative judge STEPWISER is shown to be superior to existing methods on Process- Bench, to provide improved inference time search, and better training time rewards for building better response models. We show that both the use of reasoning during judgement, and training with RL in order to reason about reasoning, are important components to achieve this performance.

Sweet-rl: Training multi-turn llm agents on collaborative reasoning tasks. arXiv preprint arXiv:2503.15478, 2025. 16 A ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENT DETAILS AND RESULTS A.1 DISCRIMINATIVE JUDGE TRAINING AND RL TRAINING Discriminative stepwise judge training. We follow Xiong et al. (2024b) to formulate the discrimi- native stepwise judge as a multi-turn conversation task. Specifically, in every user turn, we provide a single step of reasoning, while in the next assistant turn, the model will decode either \u201c+\u201d or \u201c-\u201d token to indicate its judgment. For training, we use standard SFT code. The data is packed into block with length 8192 tokens. We use a learning rate of 1e \u22125, a global batch size of 32. We also mask out the user turn\u2019s loss. We present the representative training loss curves in Figure 3. 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 Optimization Steps 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 Training Loss Discriminative: Rel-Effective + SFT, 1.5B Discriminative: Rel-Ratio + SFT, 1.5B Discriminative: Abs-Q + SFT, 1.5B 0 200 400 600 800 1000 Optimization Steps 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 Training Loss Discriminative: Rel-Effective + SFT, 7B Discriminative: Rel-Ratio + SFT, 7B Discriminative: Abs-Q + SFT, 7B Figure 3: The training loss curves of discriminative stepwise judge under different learning signals.

Left: 1.5B model, Right: 7B model. Hyperparameter search for stepwise labeling. We conduct hyperparameter tuning for the learning signals labeling. We mainly search by training discriminative models and SFT training, as this is more computationally efficient than full RL training. For Rel-Ratio, we search over \u03b3 \u2208 {0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2}, and for Rel-Effective, we search over \u03b1 \u2208{0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0} with a fixed N = 4. For Qwen2.5-1.5B-chunk, we choose \u03b3 = 0.8 and \u03b1 = 0.4, while for Qwen2.5-7B-chunk, we use \u03b3 = 0.7 and \u03b1 = 0.8. Learning curves of RL training. We present a representative example of training reward, entropy loss, and response length with and without clip higher technique. The model is Qwen2.5-7B-chunk and the learning signal is Rel-Ratio with threshold 0.7. We can see that clip higher helps to encourage exploration and leads to a higher training curve. Prompt dataset balance technique. In our early experiments, we observed that the prompt sets could be highly imbalanced. For example, using the Qwen2.5-1.5B-chunk model, the proportion of positive samples for Rel-Ratio with a threshold of 0.8 is 56.5%, while for Abs-Q, it is 70.2%. Such imbalance may cause model degeneration, as the model can achieve a high score by simply predicting \u201ccorrect\u201d in most cases. To address this, we consider a prompt balance technique that down-samples the majority class. We defer a detailed analysis to Appendix A.4. A.2 ADDITIONAL RESULT ON CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY We plot the stepwise classification accuracy under different learning signals in Figure 5. For Rel-Ratio and Rel-Effective, we observe that the RL-trained generative STEPWISER judge achieves significantly higher test accuracy on both intermediate steps and final answer correctness. This suggests that the additional reasoning steps enable a more expressive model class that better fits the learning signal. In contrast, for Abs-Q, the performance gap between the discriminative and generative judges is relatively small. We suspect this is because the Abs-Q dataset has a high proportion (70.2%) of positive samples. To stabilize RL training, we down-sample the positive class, which may introduce distribution shift and affect test classification accuracy. Nevertheless, our STEPWISER model still achieves substantially higher accuracy in evaluating final answer correctness. 17 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Optimization Steps 0.58 0.60 0.62 0.64 0.66 0.68 0.70 Training Reward Generative Reasoning:Rel-Ratio with Clip Higher Generative Reasoning:Rel-Ratio without Clip Higher 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Optimization Steps 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 Entropy Loss Generative Reasoning:Rel-Ratio with Clip Higher Generative Reasoning:Rel-Ratio without Clip Higher 0 100",

The primary goal was to assess the efficacy of teaching a model to segment its own reasoning trajectories. One of the most significant findings is the substantial improvement in computational efficiency. By implementing self-segmentation, the number of required processing steps was reduced early 40%. This optimization is critical, as it translates to considerable savings in computational resources; for context, the annotation of 40000 prompts typically requires 2 to 3 weeks with 8x A100 GPUs. In terms of task performance, the benefits of self-segmentation are most apparent in the context of RL training. While the average scores for SFT are closer (27.5",
    "to considerable savings in computational resources; for context, the annotation of 40000 prompts typically requires 2 to 3 weeks with 8x A100 GPUs. In terms of task performance, the benefits of self-segmentation are most apparent in the context of RL training. While the average scores for SFT are closer (27.5 vs. 27.2 for Abs-Q), models trained with RL show significant improvements. Specifically, the average score for Abs-Q + RL increased from 32.4 to 36.1, and the Rel-Ratio + RL score rose from 31.0 to 36.2. This disparity suggests that the self-segmentation process effectively filters out noisy and less informative steps from the reasoning trajectories. The resulting cleaner signal is highly beneficial for the RL training process, which is more sensitive to data quality. This observation is also consistent with our findings from the prompt filtering and balancing experiments. Conversely, SFT appears more robust to this type of noise, and thus its performance is less impacted. A.4 ADDITIONAL ABLATION RESULT ON COT AND PROMPT DATASET BALANCING We present the detailed results of ablation on CoT and prompt dataset balancing in Table 10. The results reveal that while the absence of either component degrades the final F1 score, the underlying reasons for the performance drop are fundamentally different. The removal of CoT appears to weaken the model\u2019s overall ability to discriminate between correct and incorrect reasoning steps. This is evidenced by a general decline in accuracy for both the \u201cCorrect\u201d and \u201cError\u201d classifications across the datasets. In contrast, removing dataset balancing introduces a strong class bias. Without balancing, the model is trained on a dataset where correct steps are overrepresented, causing it to overfit and develop a tendency to classify most steps as correct. This is clearly demonstrated by a sharp increase in accuracy for the \u201cCorrect\u201d class, coupled with a significant decrease in accuracy for the \u201cError\u201d class. While the model becomes proficient at identifying correct steps, it largely loses its ability to detect errors. This trade-off is ultimately detrimental, as shown by the identical drop in the average F1 score from 60.5 to 47.9 for the Rel-Ratio model.

Again, since 7 \u22656, we use the first case of the piecewise function: f(7) = 7 \u22123 = 4. chunk 6 Thus, we have: f(5) = 4. chunk 7 The final answer is: 4 . chunk 1 (Initial Expansion) To find the value of f(5) for the given function f(x) = ( x \u22123, x \u22656 f(f(x + 5)), x < 6 , we need to follow the recursive definition of the func- tion for x < 6.

The given equation is: chunk 2 z2 + 1 z + i + z2 + 4i \u22123 z \u2212i + 2 = 4. chunk 3 First, let\u2019s express the magnitudes of the complex numbers. For the first term, we have: chunk 4 z2 + 1 z + i = (x + yi)2 + 1 x + yi + i . chunk 5 Since (x + yi)2 = x2 \u2212y2 + 2xyi, we get z2 + 1 = x2 \u2212y2 + 2xyi + 1 = (x2 \u2212y2 + 1) + 2xyi. Therefore, the magnitude is: chunk 6 (x2 \u2212y2 + 1) + 2xyi + i(x + yi) = (x2 \u2212y2 + 1 + x + y) + (2xy + x + y)i . chunk 7 This magnitude can be simplified to the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts: chunk 8 q (x2 \u2212y2 + 1 + x + y)2 + (2xy + x + y)2. chunk 9 Similarly, for the second term, we have: chunk 10 z2 + 4i \u22123 z \u2212i + 2 = (x + yi)2 + 4i \u22123 x + yi \u2212i + 2 . chunk 11 Since z2 + 4i \u22123 = x2 \u2212y2 + 2xyi + 4i \u22123 = (x2 \u2212y2 \u2212 3) + (2xy + 4)i, we get: chunk 12 z \u2212i + 2 = x + (y \u22121) = x + yi \u2212i + 2 = (x + 2) + yi. chunk 13 Using the same logic as above, the magnitude is: ... chunk 21 0 . chunk 1 (Express the Equation in Terms of Real and Imaginary Parts) To solve the given problem, we start by expressing z in its standard form z = x + yi, where x and y are real numbers. The given equation is: z2 + 1 z + i + z2 + 4i \u22123 z \u2212i + 2 = 4. chunk 2 (Simplify the first Term) First, let\u2019s express the magnitudes of the complex numbers. For the first term, we have: z2 + 1 z + i = (x + yi)2 + 1 x + yi + i . Since (x + yi)2 = x2 \u2212y2 + 2xyi, we get z2 + 1 = x2 \u2212y2 + 2xyi + 1 = (x2 \u2212y2 +",

Therefore, the magnitude is: (x2 \u2212y2 + 1) + 2xyi + i(x + yi) = (x2 \u2212y2 + 1 + x + y) + (2xy + x + y)i . This magnitude can be simplified to the square root of the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts: q (x2 \u2212y2 + 1 + x + y)2 + (2xy + x + y)2. chunk 3 (Simplify the Second Term and Formulate Equations) Similarly, for the second term, we have: z2 + 4i \u22123 z \u2212i + 2 = (x + yi)2 + 4i \u22123 x + yi \u2212i + 2 . Since z2 + 4i \u22123 = x2 \u2212y2 + 2xyi + 4i \u22123 = (x2 \u2212y2 \u2212 3) + (2xy + 4)i, we get: z \u2212i + 2 = x + (y \u22121) = x + yi \u2212i + 2 = (x + 2) + yi. Using the same logic as above, the magnitude is: q\u0000x2 \u2212y2 \u22123 + x + y + 2 \u00012 + (2xy + 4 + x + y)2 = q\u0000x2 \u2212y2 \u22121 + x + y \u00012 + (2xy + x + y + 4)2. chunk 4 (Solve the System of Equations to Find z) Given that these two magnitudes sum to 4, and recognizing that the equality a2 + b2 = 4 indicates that each term must separately be 2 (because the maximum magnitude of any complex number is 2), we derive: (x2 \u2212y2 + 1 + x + y)2 + (2xy + x + y)2 = 4, \u0010 x2 \u2212y2 \u22123 + x + y + 2 \u00112 + (2xy + 4 + x + y)2 = 4. This leads to x2 \u2212y2 + x = 1 and x2 \u2212y2 \u2212x = \u22121. Solving these equations simultaneously, we get x = 1 and y = 0, so z = 1. chunk 5 (Calculate the Final Minimum Value) Finally, we need to find the minimum value of |z \u22121|. This simplifies to: |z \u22121| = |1 \u22121| = 0. Thus, the minimum value of |z \u22121| is: 0 . 22 Table 14: A representative example illustrating CoT segmentation methods based on a response from Qwen2.5-1.5B-it.

From the problem statement, we know: \u2022 The French book weighs 4 pounds. \u2022 The English book weighs 3 pounds. \u2022 The history book weighs twice as much as the English book, so the history book weighs 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 pounds. \u2022 The math and science books each weigh 2 pounds, and Cindy has 2 math books and 2 science books.

Example Mathematical Problem An n-label is a permutation of the numbers 1 through n. For example, J = 35214 is a 5-label and K = 132 is a 3-label. For a fixed positive integer p, where p \u2264n, consider consecutive blocks of p numbers in an n-label. For example, when p = 3 and L = 263415, the blocks are 263, 634, 341, and 415. We can associate to each of these blocks a p-label that corresponds to the relative order of the numbers in that block. For L = 263415, we get the following: 263 415 \u2192132; 263415 \u2192312; 263415 \u2192231; 263415 \u2192213 Moving from left to right in the n-label, there are n \u2212p + 1 such blocks, which means we obtain an (n \u2212p + 1)-tuple of p-labels. For L = 263415, we get the 4-tuple (132, 312, 231, 213). We will call this (n \u2212p + 1)-tuple the p-signature of L (or signature, if p is clear from the context) and denote it by Sp[L]; the p-labels in the signature are called windows. For L = 263415, the windows are 132, 312, 231, and 213, and we write S3[263415] = (132, 312, 231, 213) More generally, we will call any (n \u2212p +",
    "if p is clear from the context) and denote it by Sp[L]; the p-labels in the signature are called windows. For L = 263415, the windows are 132, 312, 231, and 213, and we write S3[263415] = (132, 312, 231, 213) More generally, we will call any (n \u2212p + 1)-tuple of p-labels a p-signature, even if we do not know of an n-label to which it corresponds (and even if no such label exists). A signature that occurs for exactly one n-label is called unique, and a signature that doesn\u2019t occur for any n-labels is called impossible. A possible signature is one that occurs for at least one n-label. In this power question, you will be asked to analyze some of the properties of labels and signatures. Compute the 3-signature for 52341. Historical Reasoning Path To compute the 3-signature of the 5-label L = 52341, we need to identify all the consecutive blocks of 3 numbers in the label and then convert each block into its corresponding 3-label based on the relative order of the numbers. First, identify the first block: 523. The relative order of the numbers 5, 2, and 3 is 3, 1, and 2 respectively. Therefore, the 3-label for this block is 312. Second, identify the second block: 234. The relative order of the numbers 2, 3, and 4 is 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Therefore, the 3-label for this block is 123. New Reasoning Chunk Third, identify the third block: 341. The relative order of the numbers 3, 4, and 1 is 2, 3, and 1 respectively. Therefore, the 3-label for this block is 231. Judgment To determine if the \u201dNew Reasoning chunk\u201d contains any explicit errors, we need to verify the logic for identifying the 3-label of the block 341 in the 5-label 52341. The new reasoning chunk states: Third, identify the third block: 341. The relative order of the numbers 3, 4, and 1 is 2, 3, and 1 respectively. Therefore, the 3-label for this block is 231. Let\u2019s check the relative order of the numbers in the block 341: \u2022 The number 3 is greater than 1 but less than 4. \u2022 The number 4 is greater than both 3 and 1. \u2022 The number 1 is the smallest. Thus, the relative order of the numbers 3, 4, and 1 is indeed 2, 3, and 1 respectively. This means the 3-label for the block 341 is 231. Since the reasoning follows correctly from the definition of a 3-label, the \u201dNew Reasoning chunk\u201d does not contain any explicit errors. Therefore, the final judgment is: Positive 25 Table 17: Illustrative example from the Process-Bench dataset, where the ground-truth label is \u201cincorrect.\u201d The judge model",

(b) Alice picks one of these two groups, adds one pebble to each box in that group, and removes one pebble from each box in the other group. Bob wins if, at the end of any round, some box contains no pebbles. Find the smallest n such that Alice can prevent Bob from winning. Historical Reasoning Path To find the smallest n such that Alice can prevent Bob from winning, we need to understand the constraints imposed by Bob\u2019s moves and how Alice can counter them. Let\u2019s consider the minimum number of pebbles each box must have after the first round. Since there are 60 boxes and Alice distributes n pebbles among them, the minimum number of pebbles each box will get is \u0004 n 60 \u0005 , where \u230ax\u230brepresents the greatest integer less than or equal to x. New Reasoning Chunk Now, let\u2019s analyze Bob\u2019s move in each round. In step (a), he splits the boxes into two groups of size k and 60 \u2212k. In step (b), Alice adds a pebble to each box in the chosen group and removes a pebble from each box in the other group. For Alice to prevent Bob from winning, each box must have at least one pebble after her move. This means that the difference between the total number of pebbles in the chosen group and the other group should be at most 1. Judgment Let\u2019s break this down step by step: 1. **Understanding Bob\u2019s Move**: In step (a), Bob splits the boxes into two groups of size k and 60 \u2212k. In step (b), Alice adds one pebble to each box in the chosen group and removes one pebble from each box in the other group. This means that",
    "by step: 1. **Understanding Bob\u2019s Move**: In step (a), Bob splits the boxes into two groups of size k and 60 \u2212k. In step (b), Alice adds one pebble to each box in the chosen group and removes one pebble from each box in the other group. This means that the total number of pebbles in the chosen group increases by k and the total number of pebbles in the other group decreases by 60 \u2212k. 2. **Condition for Alice to Prevent Bob from Winning**: For Alice to prevent Bob from winning, each box must have at least one pebble after her move. However, the statement \u201dthe difference between the total number of pebbles in the chosen group and the other group should be at most 1\u201d is not necessarily true. The correct condition would be that the difference in the total number of pebbles between the two groups after Alice\u2019s move should not cause any box to have zero pebbles. The reasoning in the new reasoning chunk assumes that the difference in the number of pebbles between the two groups should be at most 1, which is not necessarily the case. The correct condition would be that after Alice\u2019s move, the number of pebbles in each box should be at least 1, not necessarily that the difference in the total number of pebbles between the two groups should be at most 1. Therefore, the \u201dNew Reasoning chunk\u201d contains explicit errors. The correct interpretation of the condition for Alice to prevent Bob from winning is not correctly stated in the new reasoning chunk. The final judgment is: Negative 26 Table 18: Illustrative example from the Process-Bench dataset, where the ground-truth label is \u201cincorrect.\u201d The judge model is STEPWISER with Rel-Ratio and Qwen2.5-7B-chunk.

We are given 2n lamps numbered 1 through 2n; each of them can be on or off. At the beginning all lamps are off. We consider sequences of k steps. At each step one of the lamps is switched (from off to on or from on to off). Let N be the number of k-step sequences ending in the state: lamps 1, . . . , n on, lamps n+1, . . . , 2n off. Let M be the number of k-step sequences leading to the same state and not touching lamps n + 1, . . . , 2n at all. Find the ratio N/M. Historical Reasoning Path To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of k-step sequences that end in the state where lamps",
    "number of k-step sequences leading to the same state and not touching lamps n + 1, . . . , 2n at all. Find the ratio N/M. Historical Reasoning Path To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of k-step sequences that end in the state where lamps 1, . . . , n are on and lamps n + 1, . . . , 2n are off, and compare it to the number of such sequences that do not touch lamps n + 1, . . . , 2n at all. New Reasoning Chunk First, we determine N. The total number of lamps is 2n, and we need exactly n of them to be on and n to be off. Since the sequence ends with lamps 1, . . . , n on and n + 1, . . . , 2n off, we need to switch exactly n times among the first n lamps and the remaining k \u2212n times among the last n lamps. However, since the last n lamps are always off, these k \u2212n switches do not affect their state. Therefore, we only need to count the number of ways to choose n steps out of k to switch the first n lamps. This is given by the binomial coefficient: N = k n ! . Judgment To determine if the \u201dNew Reasoning chunk\u201d contains any explicit errors, we need to carefully analyze the statement and check its logic step by step. The reasoning chunk suggests that N, the number of k-step sequences ending in the state where lamps 1, . . . , n are on and lamps n + 1, . . . , 2n are off, is given by the binomial coefficient \u0000k n \u0001. However, this conclusion is not necessarily correct because it does not take into account the specific sequence of switching the lamps. The correct approach to find N is to consider that we need exactly n switches among the first n lamps to turn them on, and the remaining k \u2212n switches can be any combination of the n lamps (including possibly switching some lamps on and off multiple times, but ensuring that at the end, each of the first n lamps is on). The number of such sequences is not simply \u0000k n \u0001, because it does not account for the specific order in which the switches occur. In fact, the correct way to calculate N is more complex and involves considering the parity of k and n (which are the same) and the specific sequences of switching. The reasoning chunk simplifies the problem incorrectly by assuming that any n switches among the first n",
    "the switches occur. In fact, the correct way to calculate N is more complex and involves considering the parity of k and n (which are the same) and the specific sequences of switching. The reasoning chunk simplifies the problem incorrectly by assuming that any n switches among the first n lamps will result in all of them being on, without considering the constraints of the problem. Therefore, the \u201dNew Reasoning chunk\u201d contains explicit errors. The correct reasoning would involve a more detailed analysis of the sequences of switches, taking into account the parity and the specific requirements of the problem. The final judgment is: Negative 27 Table 19: Illustrative example from the Process-Bench dataset, where the ground-truth label is \u201cincorrect.\u201d The judge model is STEPWISER with Rel-Ratio and Qwen2.5-7B-chunk.

Example Mathematical Problem Determine all functions f from the set of positive integers into the set of positive integers such that for all x and y there exists a non degenerated triangle with sides of lengths x, f(y) and f(y + f(x) \u22121). Historical Reasoning Path To determine all functions f from the set of positive integers into the set of positive integers such that for all x and y there exists a non-degenerate triangle with sides of lengths x, f(y), and f(y + f(x) \u22121), we need to use the triangle inequality. The triangle inequality states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Therefore, we have the following three inequalities: First, x + f(y) > f(y + f(x) \u22121) Second, x + f(y + f(x) \u22121) > f(y) Third, f(y) + f(y + f(x) \u22121) > x We will analyze these inequalities one by one. ### Step 1: Analyze the inequality x + f(y) > f(y + f(x) \u22121) This inequality can be rewritten as: f(y + f(x) \u22121) < x + f(y) This tells us that f(y + f(x) \u22121) is strictly less than x + f(y). New Reasoning Chunk ### Step 2: Analyze the inequality x + f(y + f(x) \u22121) > f(y) This inequality can be rewritten as: f(y + f(x) \u22121) > f(y) \u2212x This tells us that f(y + f(x) \u22121) is strictly greater than f(y) \u2212x. Since f(y) and x are positive integers, f(y) \u2212x could be negative or zero, but f(y + f(x) \u22121) must be a positive integer. Therefore, the smallest possible value for f(y) \u2212x is 0, which means f(y) \u2265x. Judgment To determine if the \u201dNew Reasoning chunk\u201d contains any explicit errors, we need to analyze the given inequality x + f(y +",
    "negative or zero, but f(y + f(x) \u22121) must be a positive integer. Therefore, the smallest possible value for f(y) \u2212x is 0, which means f(y) \u2265x. Judgment To determine if the \u201dNew Reasoning chunk\u201d contains any explicit errors, we need to analyze the given inequality x + f(y + f(x) \u22121) > f(y) and see if it leads to the conclusion that f(y) \u2265x. Starting with the inequality: x + f(y + f(x) \u22121) > f(y) we can rearrange it to: f(y + f(x) \u22121) > f(y) \u2212x Since f(y) and x are positive integers, f(y) \u2212x could be negative or zero. However, f(y + f(x) \u22121) must be a positive integer. This means that f(y) \u2212x must be less than f(y + f(x) \u22121), but it does not necessarily mean that f(y) \u2265x. The inequality f(y + f(x) \u22121) > f(y) \u2212x only tells us that f(y) \u2212x is less than a positive integer, which does not imply that f(y) itself must be at least x. Therefore, the reasoning in the new reasoning chunk contains an explicit error in its conclusion that f(y) \u2265x. The correct interpretation of the inequality f(y + f(x) \u22121) > f(y) \u2212x does not necessarily lead to f(y) \u2265x. The final judgment is: Negative 28 Table 20: Illustrative example from the Process-Bench dataset, where the ground-truth label is \u201cincorrect.\u201d The judge model is STEPWISER with Rel-Ratio and Qwen2.5-7B-chunk. We highlight the key parts of the reasoning trajectory in red. Example Mathematical Problem How many ways are there to put 4 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are distinguishable but the boxes are not? Historical Reasoning Path To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of ways to distribute 4 distinguishable balls into 3 indistinguishable boxes. Step 1: Counting the total number of distributions if the boxes were distinguishable. If the boxes were distinguishable, each ball would have 3 choices (3 boxes). Since there are 4 distinguishable balls, the total number of distributions would be 34 = 81. However, since the boxes are indistinguishable, we need to adjust for overcounting. Step 2: Identifying the cases where the boxes are indistinguishable. There are three main cases where the boxes are indistinguishable: First, all 4 balls in one box (1 way). Second, 3 balls in one box and 1 ball in another box (4 ways, since the balls are distinguishable and we can choose any of the 4 balls to be alone). Third, 2 balls in one box and 2 balls in another box (6 ways, since there are 6 pairs of balls that can be in the same box). However, these cases also include some overcounting since the boxes are indistinguishable. We",
    "choose any of the 4 balls to be alone). Third, 2 balls in one box and 2 balls in another box (6 ways, since there are 6 pairs of balls that can be in the same box). However, these cases also include some overcounting since the boxes are indistinguishable. We need to adjust for this overcounting. New Reasoning Chunk Step 3: Adjusting for overcounting. In case 2, when we have 3 balls in one box and 1 ball in another box, we counted each distribution 3 times (since there are 3 boxes and we could swap the lone ball with the other balls). So, we divide by 3 for this case. In case 3, when we have 2 balls in one box and 2 balls in another box, we counted each distribution 6/2 = 3 times (since there are 3 pairs of boxes). So, we divide by 3 for this case. Now we have: \u2022 Case 1: 1 way \u2022 Case 2: 4 / 3 ways \u2022 Case 3: 6 / 3 ways Judgment To determine if the \u201dNew Reasoning chunk\u201d contains any explicit errors, we need to carefully analyze the reasoning step by step. The new reasoning chunk states: In case 2, when we have 3 balls in one box and 1 ball in another box, we counted each distribution 3 times (since there are 3 boxes and we could swap the lone ball with the other balls). So, we divide by 3 for this case. In case 3, when we have 2 balls in one box and 2 balls in another box, we counted each distribution 6/2 = 3 times (since there are 3 pairs of boxes). So, we divide by 3 for this case... Let\u2019s evaluate each case: Case 2: 3 balls in one box and 1 ball in another box When we have 3 balls in one box and 1 ball in another box, we do indeed count each distribution 3 times because we can place the single ball in any one of the 3 boxes. Therefore, the correct number of distinct distributions for this case is 4 (the number of ways to choose which ball will be the single ball) divided by 3, but this division is incorrect because it assumes that each distribution is counted exactly 3 times, which is not necessarily true. The correct approach would be to consider the different ways to assign the balls without overcounting due to the indistinguishability of the boxes. The correct count for this case is actually 4, not 4/3. Case 3: 2 balls in one box and 2 balls in another box When we have 2 balls in one box and 2 balls in another box,",
    "assign the balls without overcounting due to the indistinguishability of the boxes. The correct count for this case is actually 4, not 4/3. Case 3: 2 balls in one box and 2 balls in another box When we have 2 balls in one box and 2 balls in another box, we need to count the number of ways to partition the 4 balls into two groups of 2. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 4 is \u00004 2 \u0001 = 6, but since the boxes are indistinguishable, we have counted each distribution twice (once for each way to assign the groups to the boxes). Therefore, the correct number of distinct distributions for this case is 6/2 = 3, which the reasoning chunk correctly states. Given the above analysis, the reasoning in the new reasoning chunk contains an explicit error in its calculation for Case 2. Therefore, the final judgment is: Negative 29 Table 21: Illustrative example of chunk-reset reasoning. The judge model is STEPWISER with Rel-Effective and Qwen2.5-7B-chunk. In the first attempt of chunk 3, it contains a significant algebraic mistake in the formula relating \u03bb and r. Example Mathematical Problem 8 singers participate in the arts festival, preparing to arrange m performances, each time 4 of them will perform on stage, requiring that any two of the 8 singers perform together the same number of times. Please design a scheme so that the number of performances m is the least. Chunk 1 To solve this problem, we need to ensure that each pair of singers performs together in the same number of performances. This is a specific type of combinatorial design problem, and the solution can be approached using the concept of a balanced incomplete block design (BIBD). Here are the steps to find the solution: 1. Identify the parameters of the BIBD: \u2022 Let ( v = 8 ) (the number of singers). \u2022 Let ( k = 4 ) (the number of singers performing in each performance). \u2022 Let ( r ) be the number of performances each singer participates in. \u2022 Let ( \u03bb ) be the number of performances each pair of singers participates in together. \u2022 Let ( b ) be the number of performances (the number we need to determine). Chunk 2 2. Use the BIBD parameters to derive equations: The equation for the number of performances each singer participates in is ( r(k-1) = (v-1)\u03bb ). The equation for the number of performances is (b = vr k ). Chunk 3 (first attempt): This step uses the incorrect formula \u03bb = 4(r\u22121) 7 instead of the correct one \u03bb = 3r 7 . 3. Determine the value of",
    "participates in is ( r(k-1) = (v-1)\u03bb ). The equation for the number of performances is (b = vr k ). Chunk 3 (first attempt): This step uses the incorrect formula \u03bb = 4(r\u22121) 7 instead of the correct one \u03bb = 3r 7 . 3. Determine the value of (\u03bb): \u2022 From the first equation, we can express (\u03bb) as (\u03bb = r(k\u22121) v\u22121 ). \u2022 Substituting ( v = 8 ) and ( k = 4 ), we get (\u03bb = 4r\u22124 7 = 4(r\u22121) 7 ). \u2022 Since (\u03bb) must be an integer, ( 4(r-1) ) must be divisible by 7. The smallest positive integer ( r ) that satisfies this condition is ( r = 2 ) (since ( 4(2-1) = 4 ), and 4 is not divisible by 7, the next is ( r = 8 ) which gives ( 4(8-1) = 28 ), which is divisible by 7). \u2022 Therefore, (\u03bb = 28 7 = 4). Chunk 3 (second attempt) 3.Calculate the parameters: \u2022 First, we need to find (\u03bb). We know that (r = (v\u22121)\u03bb k\u22121 ). For (\u03bb) to be an integer, (v \u22121)\u03bb must be divisible by (k \u22121 = 3). So, \u03bb must be a multiple of 3. \u2022 Let\u2019s try (\u03bb = 1). Then (r = (8\u22121)\u00b71 4\u22121 = 7 3 ), which is not an integer. \u2022 Let\u2019s try (\u03bb = 3). Then (r = (8\u22121)\u00b73 4\u22121 = 21 3 = 7). \u2022 Now, we can calculate ( b ): (b = 8\u00b77 4 = 14). Chunk 4 4. Verify the design: \u2022 We need to check if we can indeed arrange 14 performances with 8 singers, 4 at a time, such that each pair of singers performs together exactly 3 times. \u2022 his can be verified using known designs or by constructing a specific design, but for the sake of this problem, we assume the existence of such a design. Therefore, the least number of performances m is 14 . 30 Table 22: Illustrative example of chunk-reset reasoning. The judge model is STEPWISER with Rel-Effective and Qwen2.5-7B-chunk. In the first attempt of chunk 3, the model fails to verify the condition. Example Mathematical Problem Which is the two-digit number that, when divided by the digit in the units place, gives a quotient of 9 and a remainder of 6? Chunk 1 To solve the problem, let\u2019s break it down step by step. 1. Identify the structure of the number and the division operation: \u2022 Let the two-digit number be represented as 10a + b, where a is the tens digit and b is the units digit. \u2022 According to the problem, when this number is divided by",

This can be expressed as: 10a + b = 9b + 6 Chunk 2 2. **Simplify the equation: \u2022 Rearrange the equation to isolate terms involving a: 10a + b \u22129b = 6 \u2022 Simplify:10a \u22128b = 6 \u2022 Further simplify by dividing the entire equation by 2: 5a \u22124b = 3 Chunk 3 (first attempt) This step fails verify the condition and stop with b = 3. 3.Solve for a and b: \u2022 We need to find integer values of a and b that satisfy the equation 5a - 4b = 3. Since a and b are digits (0-9) and a cannot be 0 (as 10a would not be a two-digit number), let\u2019s test possible values for b. \u2022 If b = 2: 5a \u22124(2) = 3 =\u21d25a \u22128 = 3 =\u21d25a = 11 5a = 11 does not give an integer value for a. \u2022 If b = 1: 5a \u22124(1) = 3 =\u21d25a \u22124 = 3 =\u21d25a = 7 5a = 7 does not give an integer value for a. \u2022 If b = 3: 5a \u22124(3) = 3 =\u21d25a \u221212 = 3 =\u21d25a = 15 =\u21d2a = 3 This gives an integer value for a.

    "Preprint GENERATIVE INTERFACES FOR LANGUAGE MODELS Jiaqi Chen\u2217, Yanzhe Zhang\u2217, Yutong Zhang, Yijia Shao, Diyi Yang Stanford University ABSTRACT Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly seen as assistants, copilots, and consultants, ca- pable of supporting a wide range of tasks through natural conversation. However, most systems remain constrained by a linear request-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in multi-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these limitations, we propose Gen- erative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm in which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces (UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework leverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative refinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic evaluation, we introduce a multidimen- sional assessment framework that compares generative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks, interaction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and emotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces consistently outper- form conversational ones, with humans preferring them in over 70% of cases. These findings clarify when and why users favor generative interfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human- AI interaction. Data and code are available at https://github.com/SALT-NLP/GenUI. 1 INSTRUCTION A longstanding goal in computing is to design systems that not only respond to users but also adapt by dynamically reshaping interfaces to facilitate users\u2019 interaction and help them achieve their goals (Apple Inc., 1987; Lyytinen & Yoo, 2002). While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have brought us closer to this vision by enabling flexible natural language understanding, the dominant interaction paradigm, which we call the conversational UI, remains static and linear: most LLM outputs are still rendered as long blocks of text, regardless of task complexity or user preference, limiting the model\u2019s ability to support the diverse ways users seek to learn, explore, and interact. At the same time, state-of-the-art LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities in automatically generating high-quality, functional webpages from sketches, queries, or natural language descriptions (Si et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024; Xiao et al., 2024). Together, these developments raise an exciting research question: How can LLMs go beyond conversational interfaces to enable adaptive, goal-driven interactions that meaningfully serve human needs? In this work, we introduce Generative Interfaces, a new paradigm that differs from conversational UIs. Rather than delivering static text responses within a predefined chatbot window, Generative Interfaces dynamically create entirely new interface structures that adapt to users\u2019 specific goals and interaction requirements. While recent tools like OpenAI\u2019s Canvas and Claude\u2019s Artifacts enhance user interaction by providing dedicated workspaces for documents, code, and visualizations, our approach extends this vision by supporting deeper engagement and enabling richer, task- specific experiences. For example, as shown in Figure",

While recent tools like OpenAI\u2019s Canvas and Claude\u2019s Artifacts enhance user interaction by providing dedicated workspaces for documents, code, and visualizations, our approach extends this vision by supporting deeper engagement and enabling richer, task- specific experiences. For example, as shown in Figure 1, when users pose questions such as \u201cI want to understand neural networks\u201d or \u201cHow can I learn piano effectively?\u201d, conversational interfaces typically return long blocks of text. In contrast, Generative Interfaces transform these queries into an interactive neural network animation or a piano practice tool that offers real-time feedback. This paradigm shift presents two key challenges: (1) building the infrastructure to generate user interfaces on the fly in response to users\u2019 queries, and (2) rigorously evaluating whether such generated interfaces actually improve user experience. To address the first challenge, our framework introduces a structured interface-specific representation coupled with an iterative refinement procedure. The structured representation enables more controllable and interpretable gen- eration by explicitly modeling high-level interaction flows, interface state transitions, and component dependencies, which we formalize using finite state machines (Shehady & Siewiorek, 1997; Wagner et al., 2006). The iterative re- finement procedure further enhances output quality by prompting LLMs to generate query-specific evaluation rubrics and repeatedly refine interface candidates through generation-evaluation cycles until the system converges on a pol- ished, context-appropriate solution. To address the second challenge, we establish a systematic evaluation framework \u2217Equal contribution. 1 arXiv:2508.19227v1 [cs.CL] 26 Aug 2025 Preprint How can I learn piano e\ufb00ectively?

Specifically, we construct a diverse prompt suite, User Interface eXperience (UIX), that strategically covers diverse domains and prompt types to reflect real-world us- age scenarios (Tamkin et al., 2024). For each user query, we recruit experienced annotators to interact with different interfaces and conduct pairwise comparisons. This comprehensive evaluation not only demonstrates the superior per- formance of generative interfaces but also reveals when they excel (in structured and information-dense domains) and why users prefer them (through enhanced visual organization, interactivity, and reduced cognitive load). Our main contributions are as follows: \u2022 We propose Generative Interfaces, a paradigm that enables adaptive, goal-driven interactions with LLMs by dynamically generating user interfaces. \u2022 We develop a technical infrastructure with structured representations and iterative refinement, and an evalua- tion framework that systematically compares generative and conversational interfaces. \u2022 We demonstrate that generative interfaces significantly outperform conversational ones across diverse query types and interaction patterns. 2 GENERATIVE INTERFACE FOR LANGUAGE MODELS We begin by introducing the structured interface-specific representation (Sec.2.1). Next, we outline the generation pipeline: user queries are first mapped into intermediate representations and then decoded into UI code (Sec.2.2). Finally, we describe the iterative refinement process that applies adaptive reward functions to further optimize the generated interfaces (Sec. 2.3). 2 Fr.\u2019 gd + fe pe Functional Perception Interactive Perception hy Emotional Perception Interactive Practice Tools Try These Famous Melodies 00 00 00 0.0 oo 00 00 0.0 Preprint I want to understand quantum physics principles.

This structured representation guides the generation of (c) functional code and user interfaces. The system employs (d) iterative refinement with (e) adaptive reward functions containing query-specific evaluation rubrics. 2.1 STRUCTURED INTERFACE-SPECIFIC REPRESENTATION Directly generating interfaces is challenging due to the vast search space and the complexity of interactive contexts. To address this, we translate user queries into a structured interface-specific representation that anchors and guides the generation process. This representation operates at two complementary levels: (i) high-level interaction flows that capture user trajectories and task phases, and (ii) low-level finite state machines (FSMs) that define component behaviors and UI logic. Interaction flows The high-level interaction flow provides a symbolic abstraction of user behavior across primary interface stages. It represents user task progression as a directed graph, where transitions are triggered by UI events such as clicking. We denote this abstraction as a directed graph G = (V, T ), where nodes V represent interface views or subgoals, and edges T denote possible transitions (See Appendix C for detail definition). In the example shown in Figure 2, the natural language query I want to understand quantum physics principles\u201d is grounded into a coher- ent interaction trajectory: Open Home View \u2192Explore Tutorials\u2192Run Simulation\u2192Glossary Lookup\u201d. This abstraction captures the high-level intent and interaction logic of potential users, while concrete UI behaviors (e.g., state toggles and modal updates) are specified separately in the FSM. Finite state machines We further use Finite State Machines (FSMs) to describe how individual UI modules respond to user actions and update their states accordingly. Formally, we model each UI component as M = (S, E, \u03b4, s0), where S is the set of atomic interface states (e.g., isModalOpen=true), E is the set of user-triggered events (e.g., click, hover), \u03b4 is the state transition function, and s0 is the initial state (See Appendix C). This structure explicitly defines how the interface should behave given a particular state and a triggered event. 2.2 GENERATION PIPELINE Requirement specification First, we generate a requirement specification for the user query, capturing the main goal, desired features, UI components, interaction styles, and problem-solving strategies. This specification serves as a bridge between the user\u2019s natural language intent and formal interface design. 3 Preprint Structured representation generation Second, we generate a structured interface-specific representation (Sec. 2.1) based on the requirement specification. This representation serves as a modular and interpretable scaffold for UI generation, where the hierarchy of interaction flows and finite state machines ensures that the resulting interfaces are both coherent and functional.

    "structured interface-specific representation (Sec. 2.1) based on the requirement specification. This representation serves as a modular and interpretable scaffold for UI generation, where the hierarchy of interaction flows and finite state machines ensures that the resulting interfaces are both coherent and functional. UI generation To support the UI generation based on structured representations, we build a complementary codebase containing reusable implementations of common UI elements (e.g., clock, map, calculator, video player, code viewer, and chart). Additionally, a web retrieval module1 gathers relevant UI examples and data sources. Finally, the entire context, including the natural language query, requirement specification, structured representation, predefined compo- nents, and retrieved content examples, is passed to an LLM to synthesize executable HTML/CSS/JS code, which is rendered into an interface, as illustrated in Figure 2 (a)(b)(c). 2.3 ITERATIVE UI REFINEMENT Generating an effective and well-structured user interface is usually an iterative process (Li et al., 2024). To this end, we introduce an adaptive, reward-driven iterative refinement procedure that progressively improves UI quality by generating evaluation metrics, scoring candidates, and regenerating interfaces through multiple cycles. Adaptive reward function To support task-specific and context-aware evaluation, we employ an LLM to construct a reward function tailored to each user query adaptively. As shown in Figure 2(e), for query \u201cI want to understand quantum physics principles,\u201d the system automatically generates a set of fine-grained evaluation metrics\u2014such as Visual Structure, Explain Physics Concept, and Clarity\u2014each with associated weights and verification rules. These dimensions are scored independently and aggregated to compute the final overall score, which ranges from 0 to 100. See Appendix D for examples of adaptive reward functions. Iterative refinement As depicted in Figure 2(d), at each iteration, multiple UI candidates are generated, then the adaptive reward function evaluates these candidates. In the next iteration, we will regenerate the UI using the highest- scoring candidate from the previous iteration, along with its evaluation. This feedback loop guides the LLM to address issues related to structure, semantics, or visual design. The process continues until a candidate reaches an overall score of 90 or higher, or until we have completed five iterations. 3 EVALUATION FRAMEWORK To enable systematic evaluation, we developed a comprehensive evaluation framework, which includes a diverse user query suite named User Interface eXperience (UIX), covering various scenarios, styles, and intents (Sec. 3.1); a set of multidimensional evaluation metrics (Sec. 3.2); and an integrated human study (Sec. 3.3). 3.1 USER QUERIES In UIX, we generate a test set of 100 user queries using Claude 3.7 that spans multiple domains, supporting varying specificity levels and capturing different query complexities. Specifically, we follow best practices from prior work around how people engage with LLMs as follows. (I) Topic coverage: Prompts are uniformly distributed",
    "In UIX, we generate a test set of 100 user queries using Claude 3.7 that spans multiple domains, supporting varying specificity levels and capturing different query complexities. Specifically, we follow best practices from prior work around how people engage with LLMs as follows. (I) Topic coverage: Prompts are uniformly distributed across the ten domains defined in Clio (Tamkin et al., 2024), covering a wide range of real-world user scenarios. See Appendix A for category list. (II) Query detail level: Following Cao et al. (2025), each domain contains an equal split of concise and detailed prompts. Concise prompts express intent abstractly in fewer than 15 words (e.g., \u201cCreate a SWOT analysis for my small business\u201d), while detailed prompts provide explicit goals and rich context. (III) Query Type: As user queries shift from casual dialogue to actionable tasks, our design maintains a balanced mixture between general conversational prompts (e.g., \u201cHow can I improve my public speaking?\u201d) and interactive, task-oriented queries (e.g., \u201cI want to visualize my company\u2019s sales data\u201d). 3.2 EVALUATION METRICS To assess the quality of LLM interfaces, we adopt a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics adapted from Nielsen et al. (2012) and Hartmann et al. (2008), capturing three core dimensions of user perception: functional, interactive, and emotional. Functional Perception includes Query-Interface Consistency (QIC), which evaluates how well the generated interface aligns with and fulfills the user\u2019s query intent (Duan, 2025), and Task Efficiency (TaskEff), which measures how efficiently users can achieve their goals with minimal effort or time (Nielsen et al., 2012; Duan, 2025). 1We use exa.ai as the search API. 4 Preprint Framework Status Functional Interactive Emotional Overall QIC TaskEff Usability Learnability IC ASA IES ConvUI (Claude 3.7) vs. GenUI ConvUI 11% 14% 13% 10% 9% 3% 6% 12% Tie 6% 5% 4% 6% 6% 8% 7% 4% GenUI 83% 81% 83% 84% 85% 89% 87% 84% ConvUI (GPT-4o) vs. GenUI ConvUI 32% 41% 28% 35% 38% 13% 24% 30% Tie 11% 5% 7% 10% 8% 7% 6% 1% GenUI 57% 54% 65% 55% 54% 80% 70% 69% IUI vs. GenUI IUI 13% 17% 16% 14% 16% 20% 14% 17% Tie 18% 13% 18% 20% 15% 5% 15% 8% GenUI 69% 70% 66% 66% 69% 75% 71% 75% Table 1: Human Evaluation of UI Framework.

Finally, Emotional Perception covers Aesthetic or Stylistic Appeal (ASA), reflecting the visual consistency and attractiveness of the design (Hartmann et al., 2008; Duan et al., 2024), and Interaction Experience Satisfaction (IES), capturing the user\u2019s overall satisfaction and engagement with the interface (Duan, 2025). This enables a comprehensive assessment of user experience by tracing the full perceptual process\u2014\u201chow users understand the interface\u201d \u2192\u201chow they operate it\u201d \u2192\u201chow they emotionally respond\u201d. Instead of using the traditional Likert scale, we adopt a pairwise comparison approach, following Zheng et al. (2023); Si et al. (2024). That is, for each query, we present two interfaces to human annotators and ask for their preferences on all seven dimensions, as well as their overall preferences. 3.3 HUMAN EVALUATION For pairwise comparison, we collected human judgments on Prolific 2 (Annotators are paid at the rate of $16/hour, see Appendix G for annotator demographics). Each evaluation instance consisted of a user query and two UI outputs (Example 1 and Example 2) generated by different methods. Annotators judged which output better satisfied the criteria across seven evaluation dimensions and overall (Example 1 wins, Example 2 wins, or Tie). We aggregated the three judgments per instance using majority voting to obtain a single final decision. Despite the inherent subjectivity of interface assessments, Fleiss\u2019 Kappa (Landis & Koch, 1977) reached 0.525, indicating a moderate level of agreement. 4 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS Implementation details Our system is built on OpenCanvas3 and uses Claude 3.7 (Anthropic, 2025) as the default backbone LLM, given its strong performance in UI code generation (Si et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024). We refer to our approach as GenUI and compare it against two baselines: (I) Conversational UI (ConvUI): A traditional chat interface using either GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024) or Claude 3.7 (Anthropic, 2025). To reduce potential bias in human evaluation, we present a unified chat interface without disclosing the underlying model. For Claude 3.7, 26% of responses include artifact generation. We remove the artifacts and retain only the textual output to ensure a clean and fair comparison with other conversational systems. (II) Instructed UI (IUI): An interface generated by Claude 3.7 when explicitly prompted (query + \u201cPlease help me solve it with UI\u201d). This prompt consistently triggers artifact generation, and the resulting artifact is taken as the system output. 4.1 MAIN RESULTS AND FINDINGS Conversational Interfaces vs. Generative Interfaces As shown in",

Interestingly, ConvUI (GPT-4o) performs more competitively than ConvUI (Claude 3.7), suggesting that well-structured textual responses can still be effective in specific scenarios. Compared to ConvUI 2https://app.prolific.com 3https://github.com/langchain-ai/open-canvas 5 Preprint Figure 3: Human preference across 10 query topics (Tamkin et al., 2024). (Claude 3.7), GenUI achieves the most significant gains in ASA (+86.0%) and IES (+81.0%). Overall, its emotional appeal and interactive functionality are the primary drivers of its superior performance, resulting in an 84.0% win rate over ConvUI (Claude 3.7). These findings suggest that users clearly prefer GenUI for most queries. User comments further support this finding. For example, one noted: \u201cConvUI is a little confusing in the presentation. GenUI provides the requested information in an easy-to-understand manner, laying out everything requested and anticipating what else may be needed.\u201d This suggests that structured output and proactive interaction are key reasons why users prefer GenUI. A small number of users did express a preference for the familiarity of traditional ConvUIs, as one remarked (see interface examples in Appendix Figure 7): \u201cChatbot interface is most people know already, while GenUI is a somewhat complex and unfamiliar app.\u201d This counterpoint highlights a residual inertia in user comfort with familiar formats. However, such preference did not override the broader recognition of GenUI\u2019s objective advantages, indicating strong potential for user adaptation and adoption in real-world deployments. What domains benefit from Generative Interfaces? As shown in Figure 3, preferences for GenUI vary by domain. Users strongly favored GenUI in Data Analysis & Visualization (93.8%) and Business Strategy & Operations (87.5%), where tasks typically involve interpreting large amounts of structured information. By contrast, in Advanced AI/ML Applications, GenUI received 50.0% of preferences, suggesting that traditional linear text explanations remain effec- tive in math-heavy contexts. Overall, these results indicate that domains characterized by complex information benefit most from GenUIs, whereas ConvUIs are still suitable for domains that rely on straightforward explanations. What queries benefit from Generative Interfaces? As shown in Figure 4a, GenUI receives stronger preferences for certain query characteristics. It is particularly favored in interactive tasks (80.0%), underscoring the advantages of generative interfaces in scenarios where interaction is essential for task completion. In general conversations, users also show a clear preference for GenUI over ConvUI (73.0% vs. 23.0%). When comparing query detail level, GenUI is preferred more for detailed queries (80.0%) than for concise ones (73.0%), likely",

When comparing query detail level, GenUI is preferred more for detailed queries (80.0%) than for concise ones (73.0%), likely because simple conversational responses sometimes sufficiently address short queries, whereas GenUI may introduce unnecessary complexity. 4.2 ABLATION STUDY Our Pipeline vs. Direct Instruct We compare our framework against IUI: directly instructing Claude 3.7 to generate a web interface with the artifact feature enabled, representing a highly engineered baseline. Our system outperforms this strong baseline, achieving a 58.0% higher win rate (Table 1). Among the baselines, IUI shows better performance in emotional perception dimensions such as ASA, but it still lags behind GenUI overall. Natural Language vs. Structured Representation The natural language version provides a descriptive explanation of the UI based on the user query, without employing structured representations to define interface states formally. As shown in Table 2 (Row 1 vs. Row 2), structured representations outperform natural language, improving the win rate from 13% to 17% in overall human evaluation. 6 Human Preference Data Analysis & Visualization Language Translation Business Strategy & Operations Education & Career Development Academic Research & Writing Content Creation & Communication Digital Marketing & SEO DevOps & Cloud Infrastructure Web & Mobile App Development Advanced Al/ML Applications 0 20 40 60 380 100 Percentage (%) Convul Tie Genul Preprint (a) Breakdown of query detail level and type.

    "control group is the full GenUI framework (adaptive reward, iterative generation, and structured representation). All ablations are compared against this full version, where \u201cLoss\u201d indicates that GenUI outperforms the variant. Note that \u201cStatic\u201d refers to static reward design, \u201cOne-shot\u201d denotes generation without refinement, and \u201cNatural\u201d indicates natural language representations. One-shot Generation vs. Iterative Refinement As shown in Table 2 (Row 2 vs. Row 3), the iterative refinement process yields consistent improvements on human preference across all perception dimensions, resulting in a notable +14.0% overall win rate improvement compared to one-shot generation. Figure 4b further illustrates that each re- finement round leads to a clear performance boost, with average LLM-based reward scores increasing by +1.2% and +4.9%, respectively. Additionally, the gap between the maximum and minimum scores narrows progressively, indi- cating improved stability and convergence through iterative optimization. We illustrate an example of such iterative improvement in Appendix Figure 8, where each iteration incrementally enhances layout efficiency, usability, and user guidance, ultimately leading to a more informative and user-friendly interface through structured refinement. Reward Function: Static vs. Adaptive Table 2 (Row 3) highlights the effect of dynamic reward functions, which differ from the full version only by replacing adaptive scoring with a static baseline. The absence of dynamic rewards results in a 17.0% drop in overall win rate, with performance declining across all seven evaluation metrics. This comparison highlights the importance of dynamically adjusting evaluation criteria to capture the complex user goals and task-specific requirements inherent in each query, rather than relying on generic, fixed heuristics. 4.3 HUMAN PREFERENCE ANALYSIS To better understand the factors underlying human annotator preferences, we collected fine-grained textual justifica- tions for each perception dimension in 40% of the pairwise comparisons, and overall comments for the remaining 60%. Following the methodology of Lam et al.

(b) For each concept in (a), the chart shows the percentage of users who preferred GenUIs or ConvUIs. mantic concepts from these qualitative responses. The resulting comments were then clustered into semantic themes identified by the LLM (Figure 5). This analysis allows us to pinpoint the key factors shaping user preferences beyond surface-level considerations such as visual aesthetics and engagement. Finally, we computed preference distributions between generative and conversational interfaces within each identified semantic dimension. Cognitive Offloading as Deeper Preference Driver Cognitive offloading (Risko & Gilbert, 2016) emerges through user comments as a subtler yet deeper driver. 78.5% of users mentioning Cognitive Load & Intuition preferred GenUI. For instance, in designing a continuing education program for healthcare professionals, a user noted: \u201cThis type of information analysis is very complex ...GenUI helps to break down the categories into manageable steps ...makes the complex information easier to process.\u201d This illustrates how GenUI\u2019s interface acts as an external cognitive aid to break down information. However, in easier scenarios such as designing a high-school mathematics curriculum, Con- vUI was preferred because it \u201cclearly and informatively illustrates the steps\u201d. In summary, GenUI excels in complex, concept-heavy scenarios where cognitive offloading facilitates understanding. In contrast, ConvUI outperforms for easy and basic \u201chow-to\u201d queries where additional tools impose unnecessary cognitive load. Visual Structure Enhances Perceived Usability and Trust Among the user comments related to the \u201cPerceived Credibility & Professionalism\u201d dimension, 86.5% preferred the GenUI. Users consistently described GenUI as more authoritative, credible, and professional. For example, in response to the query \u201cHow do I conduct market research?\u201d, users commented: \u201cGenUI is more professionally written\u201d, \u201cIt offers out the more sound advice\u201d, and \u201cIt is the better discernment.\u201d Notably, this perception of professionalism does not stem solely from the content itself. In fact, many users acknowledged that both interfaces provided reasonable answers to the query (e.g., \u201cBoth answer the prompt reasonably well\u201d). What sets GenUI apart is its presentation: through modular layouts, clear hierarchies, visual anchors, and polished formatting, it delivers the information in a more organized manner. 5 RELATED WORK Context-Aware and Adaptive Interface Context-aware interfaces have been widely explored since the rise of ubiq- uitous computing, aiming to improve usability, reduce cognitive load, and better support user goals (Dey et al., 2000; Horvitz, 1999; Theng & Duh, 2008). As computing systems have become more complex and pervasive, the ability to adjust interfaces dynamically has been critical for creating more effective and accessible user experiences (Gajos & Weld, 2004; Gajos et al., 2007; Nichols et al., 2002; 2006a;b). Prior systems often adapted functionality through a fi- nite set of predefined states. While effective in constrained settings, these approaches",

Recent advances in LLMs have en- abled new forms of adaptive interfaces that dynamically generate interface elements in response to user prompts (Wu et al., 2022; Dibia, 2023; Cha et al., 2024; Cheng et al., 2024; Nandy et al., 2024). These approaches mark a shift from static outputs toward model-driven, interactive systems. To improve interaction efficiency between humans and LLMs, prior studies (Jiang et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2024; Ross et al., 2023) have proposed combining text-based ConvUIs with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). For example, OpenAI Canvas enables users to directly edit documents and code on a canvas, avoiding repeated prompt inputs; Graphologue (Jiang et al., 2023) transforms lengthy and complex LLM responses into graphical diagrams to support information exploration and question answering. However, although these approaches leverage LLMs to generate displayed content, the UIs they employ are predesigned. In contrast, GenerativeGUI (Hojo et al., 2025) explores the usability of dynamically generated interfaces in clarifying question (CQ) interactions. ClarifyGPT (Mu et al., 2023) also introduces CQs, but in the narrower domain of code generation. Beyond CQ scenarios, DynaVis (Vaithilingam et al., 2024) proposes a system that combines natural language with dynamically synthesized UI widgets to support chart editing tasks, without exploring broader, general-purpose scenarios. Unlike prior systems that modify fixed UI components (Cao et al., 2025), our framework generates complete interfaces customized to diverse user queries. Automatic UI Generation This direction has evolved from early computer vision approaches utilizing OCR and edge detection for reverse engineering mobile interfaces (Nguyen & Csallner, 2015) to neural network-based end- to-end synthesis systems (Beltramelli, 2018; Robinson, 2019; As\u00b8\u0131ro\u02d8glu et al., 2019), though limited by model ca- pacity and training data. Recent advances in LLMs have substantially improved UI generation capabilities through directly prompting LLMs with natural language descriptions (Laurenc\u00b8on et al., 2024), screenshots (Si et al., 2024), and sketches (Li et al., 2024) and iterative refinement via LLM-generated feedback (Li et",
    "though limited by model ca- pacity and training data. Recent advances in LLMs have substantially improved UI generation capabilities through directly prompting LLMs with natural language descriptions (Laurenc\u00b8on et al., 2024), screenshots (Si et al., 2024), and sketches (Li et al., 2024) and iterative refinement via LLM-generated feedback (Li et al., 2024). Our work di- verges from these paradigms by establishing direct query-to-interface mapping and requiring no UI specifications from users. More fine-grained control of the UI code generation process encompasses diverse intermediate represen- tation approaches: (I) graph-based representation to capture hierarchical relationships and dependencies between UI elements (Jiang et al., 2024), (II) UI grammar (Kong et al., 2008) to help LLMs for more intuitive and precise layout description (Lu et al., 2023), and (III) data schema-driven UI specification synthesis to guide subsequent generation processes (Cao et al., 2025). Similarly, our framework employs interaction flows and finite state machines to model the reaction to user actions and the evolution of interfaces. 6 CONCLUSION We introduce Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm in which LLMs proactively generate adaptive, interactive interfaces to better support complex user goals. Our evaluation demonstrates clear advantages over tradi- tional conversational approaches, particularly in structured and information-dense tasks. The findings further clarify when generative interfaces are most effective and when conversational formats remain competitive. Future directions include integrating multimodal input, domain-specific templates, and collaborative multi-user environments. Limitations First, the system only supports HTML/JavaScript frontends without backend logic, which restricts the complexity of generated interfaces. As tasks grow more complex, more expressive representations beyond interaction flows and finite state machines may be needed. Second, the iterative refinement process introduces latency of up to several minutes, which may be undesirable in real-time settings. Advances in model efficiency and infrastructure could help mitigate this issue. Third, the system generates interfaces for all queries, even when interaction is unnecessary. Future work could incorporate a classifier to determine whether an input requires interaction in context and selectively invoke the generative UI system. Finally, our evaluation is based on controlled benchmarks rather than open-ended user studies (Chiang et al., 2024), leaving open the question of how generative UIs perform in real-world usage.

Automatic assessment (0\u2013100 scale) of UI frameworks across functional, interactive, and emotional perception categories. User-centered evaluation remains the gold standard for UI assessment due to interfaces\u2019 fundamental purpose of facil- itating human interaction and operation (Hartmann et al., 2008; Duan, 2025; Cao et al., 2025). However, generative interfaces requiring real-time synthesis and rapid iterative refinement cannot depend on user feedback, necessitating robust automatic evaluation frameworks. Early approaches employed manually crafted behavioral prediction metrics (Lee et al., 2020), though these methods demonstrated limited generalizability and required substantial domain expertise. Recent research has increasingly leveraged LLMs for UI assessment, with Duan et al. (2024) employing LLMs to generate design feedback and qual- ity ratings with bounding box annotations. Jeon et al. (2025) extends this paradigm to persuasiveness evaluation, achieving meaningful correlation with empirical A/B testing outcomes. In this work, we ask LLMs to judge the same dimensions that we ask human annotators, including some previously human-exclusive metrics such as task efficiency and learnability. Specifically, we use a listwise ranker (Liu et al., 2023) to evaluate different interface variants of the same user query by presenting the LLM (Claude 3.7) with UI codes and screenshots, where the LLM assigns scores ranging from 0 to 100 for each evaluation",

Specifically, we use a listwise ranker (Liu et al., 2023) to evaluate different interface variants of the same user query by presenting the LLM (Claude 3.7) with UI codes and screenshots, where the LLM assigns scores ranging from 0 to 100 for each evaluation dimension. We compare LLM evaluation scores with pairwise annotations from humans, which yields an agreement rate of 69.0%. While it suggests LLM as a reliable proxy for convenient and scalable evaluations, we also observe common issues like length bias (Dubois et al., 2024) which might favor GenUI. C REPRESENTATION: NATURAL LANGUAGE vs. STRUCTURED To present a more fine-grained comparison, we showcase two distinct representations of the same user intent. The user prompt used here is: \u201cI want to understand quantum physics principles.\u201d A natural language representation includes the goal, salient features, technical requirements, and user preferences, which are expressed through multiple descriptive fields. This format provides rich detail about the UI requirements without imposing any constraints on the interface states or their transitions. 13 Preprint Term / Symbol Definition Interaction Flow A high-level abstraction over user interaction sequences, model- ing task progression as transitions across interface views. G = (V, T ) Directed graph structure of the interaction flow: V is the set of views or subgoals, and T is the set of transitions between them. V Nodes in the interaction graph, each representing a specific UI view or a subgoal in the task. T Directed edges indicating possible user-triggered transitions be- tween views, such as button clicks or link navigation. Finite State Machine (FSM) A formalism used to describe the behavior and state transitions of individual UI components based on user interactions. M = (S, E, \u03b4, s0) Formal definition of an FSM: S is the state set, E the event set, \u03b4 the transition function, and s0 the initial state. S Set of all possible atomic interface states (e.g., isModalOpen=true, activeTab=2). E Set of discrete user-triggered events such as click, hover, input, etc. \u03b4 Transition function \u03b4 : S \u00d7 E \u2192S, defining how a component\u2019s state evolves given an event. s0 The initial state of the UI component when the interface is first rendered.

H HUMAN ANNOTATION FILTERING To ensure the reliability of human annotations, we employed a multi-stage filtering process involving trap questions, consistency checks, and agreement rate evaluation. \u2022 Trap Questions. Each annotation task contained 8 UI comparison questions. In some questionnaires, we embedded trap questions in which the \u201cUI\u201d was not a real interface with components, but rather a simple instruction such as \u201cSelect Example A for all options\u201d or \u201cSelect Example B for all options.\u201d Annotators who failed to follow these explicit instructions were identified as inattentive, and their entire submissions were discarded. \u2022 Consistency Check. We manually compared each annotator\u2019s multiple-choice selections with their accom- panying textual comments. If a comment stated that Example A was better but the selected option was B, we considered this a clear inconsistency indicative of random selection. Such annotations were removed. \u2022 Manual Review. We conducted a manual review for annotators who had low agreement with other annotators and determined whether the annotator\u2019s responses showed signs of random or careless selection. If so, all responses from that annotator were excluded. Through this process, we ensured that the retained annotations were both attentive and internally consistent, thereby improving the overall quality of our evaluation. 19 Conducting Effective Market Research \u00a9 You 5/1/2025, 2:03:15 AM How do | conduct market research? a) Assistant 5/1/2025, 2:03:28 AM How to Conduct Market Research Market research is the process of gathering and analyzing information about a market, including cus- tomers, competitors, and industry trends.

    "Evaluating the Evaluators: Are readability metrics good measures of readability? Isabel Cachola, Daniel Khashabi\u2217and Mark Dredze\u2217 Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21211 {icachola, danielk, mdredze}@cs.jhu.edu Abstract Plain Language Summarization (PLS) aims to distill complex documents into accessible sum- maries for non-expert audiences. In this pa- per, we conduct a thorough survey of PLS literature, and identify that the current stan- dard practice for readability evaluation is to use traditional readability metrics, such as Flesch- Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL). However, de- spite proven utility in other fields, these met- rics have not been compared to human read- ability judgments in PLS. We evaluate 8 read- ability metrics and show that most correlate poorly with human judgments, including the most popular metric, FKGL. We then show that Language Models (LMs) are better judges of readability, with the best-performing model achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.56 with human judgments. Extending our analysis to PLS datasets, which contain summaries aimed at non-expert audiences, we find that LMs bet- ter capture deeper measures of readability, such as required background knowledge, and lead to different conclusions than the traditional met- rics. Based on these findings, we offer recom- mendations for best practices in the evaluation of plain language summaries. We release our analysis code and survey data. \u00a7 JHU-CLSP/eval-the-eval-readability 1 Introduction In the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), plain language summarization (PLS) distills com- plex documents, such as scientific articles, into ac- cessible summaries for non-expert audiences while preserving essential meaning (Chandrasekaran et al., 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the critical need to make scientific knowledge ac- cessible to the general public (Wang et al., 2020). By enhancing public engagement with research, \u2217Equal advising. PLS can help bridge the gap between expert knowl- edge and general understanding. Although human evaluation remains the gold standard for assessing summary quality and read- ability, the high cost and slow turnaround (Liu et al., 2022) have led many researchers to rely on auto- matic evaluation metrics for evaluating PLS sum- maries (Goldsack et al., 2022; Guo et al., 2021). Al- though these metrics have been validated in fields such as education and law (Thorndike, 1936; Han et al., 2024), their effectiveness in reflecting read- ability in the context of PLS remains unproven. Are automated readability metrics appropriate evaluators for the task of PLS? We explore whether the definition of readability as implemented by au- tomated measures matches the definition used by the PLS research community. Additionally, given that Language Models (LMs) can reason over com- plex language tasks (Brown et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2024), we explore whether LMs can judge the readability of a summary. Given these motivations, we ask the following research",
    "used by the PLS research community. Additionally, given that Language Models (LMs) can reason over com- plex language tasks (Brown et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2024), we explore whether LMs can judge the readability of a summary. Given these motivations, we ask the following research questions (RQs). RQ1 What is the current standard of evalua- tion in PLS literature? We review PLS literature by collecting relevant papers published in *ACL venues from 2013 to 2025 and note the readability evaluation method used in the study. We find that the majority of papers focus on a small number of traditional readability metrics, such as Flesch- Kincaid grade Level (FKGL) (Flesch, 1952). This finding motivates our analysis of the suitability of traditional readability metrics for PLS evaluation. RQ2 How well do traditional readability met- rics correlate with human readability judg- ments? Since the PLS research community em- ploys these traditional metrics (RQ1), we assess their suitability by measuring their correlation with human readability judgments. A low correlation would suggest that a metric is inadequate for eval- 1 arXiv:2508.19221v1 [cs.CL] 26 Aug 2025 uating PLS readability, and would necessitate the PLS research community identify and move to bet- ter metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to compare traditional readability metrics to human readability judgments for PLS. RQ3 How well do LM-based evaluators corre- late with human readability judgments? Tra- ditional readability metrics primarily use lexical features, such as the number of syllables in a word, to measure readability. In contrast, LMs may cap- ture more complex attributes of readability than traditional metrics, such as the inclusion of neces- sary context and explanation of key concepts. The findings of this research question have important implications for both the best practices in evalu- ation of PLS and the broader NLP community\u2019s understanding of LM capabilities. RQ4 What do LM-based evaluators reveal about the readability of popular summarization datasets? Researchers often rely on traditional readability metrics when assessing summaries in new methods or datasets. However, if these met- rics correlate poorly with human judgments, the resulting conclusions may be flawed. Similarly, existing datasets, which often arise from data of convenience, may be poorly suited to PLS research. This RQ explores what LM-based evaluators re- veal about the readability of popular summariza- tion datasets and how LM-based conclusions differ from those based on traditional readability metrics. We answer these questions through the follow- ing contributions. First, we survey PLS papers published in *ACL venues and find that the most popular metric for readability evaluation is Flesch- Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL) (Flesch, 1952).

    "We answer these questions through the follow- ing contributions. First, we survey PLS papers published in *ACL venues and find that the most popular metric for readability evaluation is Flesch- Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL) (Flesch, 1952). Mo- tivated by these findings, we then compare 8 tradi- tional readability metrics to human judgments. We show that 6 of the 8 metrics have a poor correla- tion (less than 0.3 Pearson correlation) with human judgments, including FKGL, indicating that these metrics are poor measures of readability for PLS. Additionally, we compare the judgments of 5 LMs to human judgments and show that LMs outper- form the traditional metrics. We demonstrate that LMs have promising potential as evaluators by rea- soning over more complex attributes of readability. We use LM evaluators to re-evaluate 10 summariza- tion datasets and show that some summarization datasets intended for PLS achieve similar readabil- ity scores to those aimed at expert audiences, call- ing into question the utility of these data. Finally, based on a thorough analysis of current readabil- ity evaluation practices, we offer recommendations for best practices in PLS evaluation and identify opportunities for future work. 2 Related Works Summarization evaluation. PLS research often introduces either datasets (Goldsack et al., 2022; Crossley et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2024; Manor and Li, 2019), methods (Guo et al., 2022; August et al., 2022; Luo et al., 2022; Ji et al., 2024; Flores et al., 2023), or both (Guo et al., 2021; Zaman et al., 2020; Chandrasekaran et al., 2020). The majority of prior work use a combination of readability met- rics, such as Flesch Reading Ease (Flesch, 1943) or the Gunning-Fog Index (Gunning, 1952) to vali- date the readability of their dataset or generations. Readability metrics are typically reported in con- junction with more general summarization metrics, such as ROUGE (Lin, 2004) or BertScore (Zhang* et al., 2020). General summarization evaluation is a well-studied area, with ongoing work analyzing both the efficacy of summarization metrics (Fabbri et al., 2020; Khashabi et al., 2022; Goyal et al., 2022) and designing metrics that better align with human judgments (Liu et al., 2023c, 2022). Guo et al. (2023) analyzed how perturbations in plain language summaries affect results of general sum- marization metrics. In this work, we focus on read- ability metrics, rather than general summarization metrics, with the goal of understanding how well readability metrics measure readability for PLS. Readability Metrics. While readability met- rics are well studied in fields such as educa- tion (Thorndike, 1936; DuBay, 2004; Sibeko and van Zaanen, 2022) and linguistics (Carla Pires and Vig\u00e1rio, 2017), there is little work studying how well these metrics perform for the task of PLS.

    "Metrics. While readability met- rics are well studied in fields such as educa- tion (Thorndike, 1936; DuBay, 2004; Sibeko and van Zaanen, 2022) and linguistics (Carla Pires and Vig\u00e1rio, 2017), there is little work studying how well these metrics perform for the task of PLS. Most traditional metrics were not designed specifi- cally for PLS, or even for evaluation in Computer Science. The most common origin of traditional metrics is the need to assess the readability of K- 12 school texts (Dale and Chall, 1948; Coleman and Liau, 1975). Linsear Write was introduced in the book, Gobbledygook has gotta go, published by the US Department of the Interior for the pur- poses of measuring the complexity of government communications (O\u2019hayre, 1966). As readability metrics rely primarily on lexical features (Rush, 1985), prior work has offered criticism of read- ability metrics, showing that they can be easily 2 manipulated to provide better scores with changes that do not substantially improve the readability of summaries (Tanprasert and Kauchak, 2021). Other work has looked at which linguistic attributes are correlated with readability metrics (\u0160tajner et al., 2012). To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to measure the correlation of readability metrics with human readability judgments. LMs as Evaluators. Recent advances in LMs have shown that they are capable of reasoning over complex language (Brown et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2024). LMs have been shown to be effective evaluators in other natural language tasks (Li et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2024; Nedelchev et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2023a), including related summarization tasks (Song et al., 2024). Given this success in prior work, we hypothesize that LMs are capable of evaluating the readability of plain language summaries. In particular, we hypothesize that LMs can reason over more complex attributes of readability, such as the background required or whether technical concepts are explained. 3 Experimental Setup 3.1 Current PLS evaluation standards RQ1 We aim to conduct a thorough literature survey of the standard practices in readability evaluation for PLS. We collect papers1 from the ACL Anthol- ogy2 that mention one of the following key phrases: \u201cplain language summarization,\u201d \u201creadable sum- maries,\u201d or \u201clay summarization.\u201d We exclude pa- pers published for a shared task from annotation and assume the participants use the metrics desig- nated by the shared task organizers. Our goal is to understand the decisions made by researchers, and including shared task papers in this survey would over-represent the decisions made by the task orga- nizers. We report the evaluation methods used by the shared tasks and the number of participants to represent the impact of the evaluation choices. We identify 55 papers that",

We report the evaluation methods used by the shared tasks and the number of participants to represent the impact of the evaluation choices. We identify 55 papers that match our criteria. We an- notate the papers for relevance to PLS, the type of publication (Main conference, Findings, or Work- shop), and which readability evaluation metrics are used. We exclude papers from the survey not rel- evant to PLS, resulting in 18 relevant papers from the years 2013 to 2025. The most common reasons for relevance exclusion include using \u201creadable\u201d in 1On May 7th, 2025 2https://aclanthology.org/ a different word sense (e.g. \u201chuman readable\u201d vs \u201cmachine readable\u201d) or just citing a PLS paper. We report the number of papers that use each metric. 3.2 Comparing traditional readability metrics to human judgments RQ2 Human Annotated Data. To measure the cor- relation between readability metrics with human judgments, we use the dataset collected by Au- gust et al. (2024). This dataset contains 60 sum- maries of 10 scientific papers in a variety of do- mains. Each paper has both expert written and machine written summaries (generated using GPT- 3.) The summaries are annotated on a scale of 1 to 5 for the annotator\u2019s reading ease of the article. 1 indicates a very poor reading ease, while 5 indi- cates a very high reading ease. For each summary, we take the average of the annotators\u2019 scores to cal- culate the correlations with readability evaluations as described below. August et al. (2024) originally collected this dataset to better understand human preferences in scientific summarization. In this pa- per, we extend their work by applying their findings to summarization evaluation metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only available dataset of human judgments for PLS. Appendix A contains additional dataset details. Traditional readability metrics. We consider \u201ctraditional\u201d readability metrics to be those most commonly used in PLS literature. These met- rics are well-established, and have been used in past work as judges of readability (Chan- drasekaran et al., 2020). This term excludes LM- based evaluations, discussed in \u00a7 3.3. We con- sider 8 readability metrics: Flesh-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL) (Flesch, 1952), Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) (Flesch, 1943), Dale Chall Readabil- ity Score (DCRS) (Dale and Chall, 1948), Auto- mated Readability Index (ARI) (Smith and Senter, 1967), Coleman Liau Index (CLI) (Coleman and Liau, 1975), Gunning Fog Index (GFI) (Isnaeni, 2017), Spache (Spache, 1953) and Linsear Write (LW) (O\u2019hayre, 1966).

    "(Smith and Senter, 1967), Coleman Liau Index (CLI) (Coleman and Liau, 1975), Gunning Fog Index (GFI) (Isnaeni, 2017), Spache (Spache, 1953) and Linsear Write (LW) (O\u2019hayre, 1966). All of the metrics, except for DCRS and Spache, use lexical features such as number of syllables or length of sentences to measure readability. DCRS and Spache use word familiarity to measure readability, assuming that more common words are easier to read (Dale and Chall, 1948; O\u2019hayre, 1966).3 3We use the py-readability-metrics package to calculate the readability scores. 3 Quantifying alignment between traditional met- rics and humans. We report the Pearson and Kendall-Tau correlation of each metric listed above with the human judgments collected by August et al. (2024). Except for LW and FRE, all met- rics provide a lower score for higher readability, while the human judgments provide a higher score for higher readability. To calculate correlations, we multiply the scores by \u22121 (except for LW and FRE), so that text rated as more readable by tra- ditional metrics will be positively correlated with human judgments. 3.3 LMs as evaluators of readability RQ3 We experiment with the following 5 LMs as evalu- ators of readability: Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023), Mixtral 7B (Jiang et al., 2024), Gemma 7B (Team, 2024), Llama 3.1 8B, and Llama 3.3 70B (Dubey et al., 2024). We experiment with 3 prompts and report the prompts in appendix B. We report the Pearson and Kendall-Tau correlations of the scores provided by each LM with the human judgments. 3.4 Analysis of summarization datasets RQ4 To test the ability of our results to generalize to datasets outside of the one collected by August et al. (2024), we include datasets with intended audiences more specific than \u201cgeneral\u201d - experts and kids. We expect expert-targeted datasets to be given low readability scores and kid-targeted datasets to have high readability scores. Expert targeted datasets. We include 3 expert- targeted datasets: arXiv, PubMed (Cohan et al., 2018) and SciTLDR (Cachola et al., 2020). arXiv and PubMed are collections of abstracts in the Com- puter Science and Biomedical domains, respec- tively (Cohan et al., 2018). SciTLDR is a collection of short, expert-targeted, one sentence summaries of Computer Science papers. We expect our meth- ods to provide low readability scores. Additionally, the comparison of SciTLDR to arXiv and PubMed allows us to test if the scores are length dependent. Kid-targeted dataset. The Science Journal for Kids (SJK) dataset is a collection of summaries of scientific papers in a variety of domains, intended for kids (Stefanou et al., 2024). Given that this dataset is targeted to kids, we expect it would re- ceive high readability scores. General audience datasets. In addition to the datasets listed above,",

These datasets are intended for a general au- dience. CDSR, PLOS, and CELLS are written by journal editors or experts. eLife Sciences gives pa- per authors the option to write \u201ceLife digests,\u201d with the goal of \u201ccutting jargon and putting research in context.\u201d 4 The Eureka dataset was collected from EurekaAlert, which hosts press releases about re- search for scientific journalists. Finally, SciNews is a collection of scientific news reports, written by science reporters. Table 1 contains a comparison of the summariza- tion datasets analyzed in this paper. We use the test split of each dataset for our analysis and we report the intended audience, domain, number of documents in the test set, and average number of white-space delineated tokens. In total, we analyze 10 popular scientific summarization datasets. 4 Results 4.1 Current PLS evaluation standards RQ1 We found 18 ACL Anthology papers on the task of PLS and 3 shared tasks, representing 81 additional papers. Figure 1 shows the literature survey results, excluding metrics used by a single paper. FKGL is the most popular metric, followed by CLI and DCRS. LM-based evaluations are uncommon (4 of the 18 papers). The shared task BioLaySumm used FKGL and DCRS for both years, adding CLI in 2024.

Less popular metrics include GFI, ARI, lexical proxies (e.g., number of sentences in a document), and FRE. In \u00a7 4.2, we place the highest importance on the results of the most commonly used evaluation metrics: FKGL, CLI, and DCRS. 4.2 Comparing traditional readability metrics to human judgments RQ2 In Table 2a, we report the Pearson and Kendall- Tau correlation of 8 traditional readability metrics with human judgments. We find that 6 of the 8 metrics have less than 0.3 Pearson correlation with human judgments. DCRS and CLI have the highest correlation, achieving 0.2 Pearson points higher correlation than the most popular metric, FKGL (\u00a7 4.1). FKGL receives only 0.16 Pearson and 0.08 Kendall-Tau correlation, indicating little to no correlation with human judgment. Table 3 shows an example summary and read- ability scores, along with its human judgment. The human annotators gave the example summary an average rating of 4.05/5; they found the text fairly readable. However, the majority of traditional metrics give the summary poor readability scores: college level or higher. This is likely because the text includes domain-specific vocabulary, such as \u201cacute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),\u201d which is penalized by traditional metrics.

LMs have been shown to perform well on many language understanding tasks (Brown et al., 2020; Srivastava et al., 2023), indicating that they have some understanding of language. We hypoth- esize that this knowledge will translate well to the task of PLS, and the LMs will be able to reason about more complex features of a summary that impact the readability. We experiment with 3 prompts. We report best performing prompt in Figure 2 and its results in Ta- ble 2b; the other prompts and their results are in Ap- pendix B.

We conduct significance testing and report the p-values comparing the LM results to the traditional metrics in Appendix C. Performance in this task is not solely a factor of model size, as we see that smaller models perform similarly to the larger models. The difference in performance between the LMs is small, indicating that most generally well-performing models can be good judges of readability.

The most readable PLS datasets are CDSR and SciNews. iTLDR receive low readability scores, averaging less than 2/5. This matches our expectations since summaries intended for an expert audience typi- cally have low readability for non-experts. We also note that SciTLDR receives similarly low readabil- ity scores, despite containing significantly shorter summaries than the arXiv and PubMed datasets. This shows that the LM evaluator is not simply favoring shorter summaries as more readable. Kid-targeted dataset. SJK receives high read- ability scores, with an average readability of 4.40. The results of the expert and kid targeted datasets match our expectations of readability scores, and serve to support the analysis of the remaining 6 general-audience datasets below. General audience datasets. We analyze 6 popu- lar PLS datasets: CDSR, PLOS, eLife, Eureka, CELLS, and SciNews. PLOS and CELLS re- ceive mean readability scores of 2.06 and 2.23, respectively. These scores are similar to the expert- targeted datasets described above, indicating that these two datasets may not be well-suited for PLS. SciNews and CDSR receive the highest readability scores, with average scores of 3.49 and 3.37, re- spectively, indicating that they are the well suited for the task of PLS. Keyword analysis. To understand the LM\u2019s rea- soning for assigning scores, we use the YAKE! al- gorithm to extract keywords from the reasoning provided by the LM evaluator for why each sum- mary was provided with a specific score (Campos et al., 2020).

This keyword analysis indicates LMs are attributing their judgements to deeper attributes that contribute to readability compared to tradi- tional metrics. LM evaluators vs. traditional metrics. Finally, we compare the results of the analysis using tradi- tional metrics to LM evaluators of readability. In this analysis, we focus on Llama 3.3 70B, the best performing LM, and FKGL, the most popular read- ability metric. Table 5 compares the average LM readability and FKGL score for each dataset, and how each metric would rank the datasets. All but 1 dataset changed their ranking depending on the met- ric used. arXiv has the largest delta, ranking 10th in readability according to the LM evaluator and 2nd according to FKGL. FKGL ranking arXiv as the 2nd most readable is particularly concerning, as this dataset is a collection of scientific abstracts, in- tended for an expert audience. To measure disagree- ment, we convert each metric into binary scores of \u201chigh readability\u201d and \u201clow readability.\u201d For FKGL, we consider any summary given a score of under 12 points to have high readability. FKGL consid- ers any text above 12 to be college reading level. For the LM evaluator, we consider any summary given a score of 3 or higher to have high readability. By converting the scores to binary labels, we cal- culate the Cohen\u2019s Kappa score (McHugh, 2012) for agreement as 0.17, indicating the two metrics have fair but not substantial agreement. We pro- vide examples of this disagreement in Table 6. This analysis shows how the evaluation metrics we use can greatly influence the conclusions we draw. 5 Discussion We found PLS an increasingly popular area of study, but researchers primarily rely on a handful of traditional metrics for evaluation.

Defi- nitional inconsistency means that the definition of \u201creadable,\u201d as measured by the metrics, differs from the definition of \u201creadable,\u201d as considered by hu- man judges. Measurement error means that, even if we have the correct definition, we are not mea- suring readability properly. We argue that there is evidence for both problems. On definitional inconsistency, the majority of readability metrics originated in the education do- main. Traditional readability metrics typically de- fine a \u201creadable\u201d text as one with an appropriate text complexity for the number of years of ed- ucation (i.e., a text has a US 9th grade reading level) (Gunning, 1952; Coleman and Liau, 1975; Flesch, 1952). In contrast, the field of PLS typically defines a \u201creadable\u201d text as one that gives a non- expert, adult reader an overall understanding of the source article. These different definitions have different implications for the resulting text. If opti- mizing for education-appropriate text complexity, we can measure the complexity of the vocabulary or sentences. However, using the PLS definition of readability, we should measure features such as whether the text includes explanations of techni- cal terms or how much background is required to understand the concepts. Traditional readability metrics also suffer from measurement error. Even if we assume a consistent definition, traditional metrics do not properly mea- sure readability. They measure lexical properties, such as number of syllables in a word, which penal- izes summaries for using clearly defined technical terms. Traditional metrics also do not measure deeper features that contribute to readability, such as how much background is",

We wanted to create a new kind of wind energy harvesting machine based on the jiggling motion of cot- tonwood tree leaves in the wind, which would be quieter and safer for wildlife. After building and testing artificial cottonwood leaves that moved and created electricity in the wind, we found that they didn\u2019t produce enough en- ergy to feasibly use for electricity production. We also tried building a cattail-like device to generate electricity when it swayed in the wind, [...] (a) FKGL = 16.47 (College-graduate), LM score = 4/5. Introduction. Accumulation of glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDC) in serum has a clinical significance as an inductor of pathological hepatocyte apoptosis, which impairs liver function. Inhibition of GCDC accumulation can be used as a marker in therapy. This study was aimed to quantify the serum level of GCDC in obstructive jaundice patients. Methodology. GCDC acid level in the serum was quantified using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique according to Muraca and Ghoos modified method. It was performed before and after decompression at day 7 and day 14. The sample was extracted with solid phase extraction (SPE) technique on SPE column. The results were analyzed using SPSS V 16.0 (P < 0.05) [...] (b) FKGL = 10.0 (10th grade), LM score = 1/5.

In \u00a7 4.3, we show that LMs are better able to reason over these more complex attributes. Table 6 shows examples in which the LM evalu- ator and FKGL disagree on the readability. FKGL rates a summary from the SJK dataset as having a graduate-college reading level, while the LM rates it as highly readable (Table 6a). Although the sum- mary explains the concepts well, long words such as \u201charvesting\u201d and \u201celectricity\u201d likely cause FKGL to rate the summary as less readable. Table 6b has a Pubmed example, which the LM rates as having low readability, while FKGL assigns the summary a 10th grade reading level. This",
    "Although the sum- mary explains the concepts well, long words such as \u201charvesting\u201d and \u201celectricity\u201d likely cause FKGL to rate the summary as less readable. Table 6b has a Pubmed example, which the LM rates as having low readability, while FKGL assigns the summary a 10th grade reading level. This example contains many short words, such as \u201cGCDC\u201d and \u201cSPE\u201d, which are favored by FKGL. Although short, these technical words that are not well defined. For exam- ple, the \u201cGCDC\u201d is defined as \u201cglycochenodeoxy- cholic acid,\u201d but is not otherwise explained. In general, we notice that FKGL favors acronyms, which are often present in technical text. 5.2 Recommendations and Future Directions We find that many traditional readability metrics have poor correlation with human judgments and that LMs provide better judgments. However, LM- evaluators are an imperfect solution since they are subject to bias and a lack of interpretability (Liu et al., 2023b; Wang et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023; Stureborg et al., 2024). Therefore, we recom- mend a multi-faceted evaluation of PLS that uses a combination of traditional readability metrics and LM evaluators. Specifically, we recommend using DCRS and CLI, which have the highest correlation with human judgments. We recommend discon- tinuing use of FKGL for PLS, the current most popular metric, due to low correlation with human judgment. We recommend using LMs as additional metrics, especially for more qualitative evaluations, such as the keyword analysis conducted in \u00a7 4.3. These types of analyses give a more holistic view of the benefits and downsides of datasets and meth- ods. Finally, we recommend that PLS research use datasets with higher readability scores (\u00a7 4.3), such as CDSR and SciNews. We recommend that PLOS and CELLS be considered general scientific sum- marization datasets and not plain language datasets. This recommendation is particularly impactful as PLOS has been used in every year the shared task BioLaySumm has occurred (Goldsack et al., 2024, 2023). Future work should focus on constructing met- rics that better align with human judgments of read- ability in both definition and measurement (\u00a7 5.1). We show that LMs are promising and worthy of future work that can decrease bias and improve in- terpretability. Dataset collection should focus on collecting highly readable summaries and consider deeper attributes of readable summaries, such as explanations of technical concepts. Limitations The conclusions of this paper are limited to the task of plain language summarization, and are not in- tended to apply to other applications of readability metrics, such as judging the age-level appropri- ateness of educational material. Additionally, our human judgments and experiments focused on the summarization of scientific articles, and may not generalize to PLS in other domains, such as law or",

Additionally, our human judgments and experiments focused on the summarization of scientific articles, and may not generalize to PLS in other domains, such as law or clinical notes. Finally, our experiments are lim- ited to the English language, and our findings may not apply to other languages. We leave the explo- ration of readability evaluation in other domains and languages to future work. 9 Ethical Considerations This paper involves the use of LMs for genera- tion and evaluation. LMs have been shown to gen- erate factually incorrect information and are sub- ject to bias (Venkit et al., 2024; Stureborg et al., 2024). Additionally, the use of language models contributes to the environmental footprint of our field (Schwartz et al., 2020). However, this paper focuses on the evaluation of plain language summa- rization, which has the potential to make scientific knowledge more accessible to the general popula- tion. Therefore, we believe that the benefits of this work outweigh the potential harms. Acknowledgments We\u2019d like to thank the authors of August et al.

Association for Com- puting Machinery. 15 Appendix A Human annotated dataset details We use the human annotated data collected by Au- gust et al. (2024). The dataset includes 60 sum- maries over 10 papers, 6 summaries per paper. Of the 6 summaries, 2 are written by experts and 4 are machine written by GPT3. The 10 papers were sampled from the top 10% of papers from r/science, a subreddit dedicated to public discussions of scien- tific papers. These papers were chosen as a proxy for scientific topics the general public is most in- terested in. The dataset was annotated by 593 Me- chanical Turk workers in total across the three tasks in the original study. Table 7 contains the distribu- tions of scores assigned by the human annotators. Score 5 4 3 2 1 % 37 29 17 10 7 Table 7: Percentage of scores assigned in human annotated dataset for reading ease. In order to measure inter-annotator agreement, we bin the scores into a binary \u201chigh-readability\u201d and \u201clow readability.\u201d Summaries given scores of 3 or higher are considered highly readable while sum- maries assigned scores less than 3 are considered to have low readability. We use Cohen\u2019s Kappa to calculate an inter-annotator agreement of 0.6. This is a moderate agreement for a somewhat subjective task, indicating that there is some general notion of readability. We also note that this is significantly higher than the agreement between traditional met- rics and LMs (0.17 as shown in \u00a7 4.4). B LM readability evaluation prompts We experiment with 3 prompts, shown in Table 10. The Simple Prompt simply asks the LM to rate the text for reading ease on a scale of 1 to 5. The Amer- ican Society for Cell Biology (ASCB) provides guidelines for best practices in scientific commu- nication.5 In the ASCB Prompt, we provide these guidelines to the LM as guidance for rating the read- ability. Finally, the Own Reasoning Prompt is sim- ilar to the Simple Prompt, but with the additional instruction for the LM to use it\u2019s own judgment to rate the text, rather than traditional readability formulas, such as FKGL. We report the Pearson and Kendall-Tau correla- tion of each prompt with human judgment in Ta- ble 8. The Own Reasoning Prompt performs the best when averaged across all models.

Table 8: Pearson and Kendall-Tau Correlation with human judgment for each prompt listed in Table 10. Own Reasoning prompt performs the best averaged across all models. that the models tended to over-rely on the guid- ance provided in the ASCB Prompt, providing lower scores if the conditions are not met. For the Simple Prompt, the models would occasionally try to cal- culate FKGL or another readability metric, rather than using its own reasoning. This is likely be- cause FKGL is strongly associated with readability in the models\u2019 training data. We found that the Own Reasoning Prompt struck the right balance be- tween providing enough instructions that the model is able to understand the task without providing too much information for the model to over-rely on. However, it is notable that the ASCB Prompt, the worst performing prompt, still achieves higher correlation with human judgment than FKGL, the most popular traditional metric. C Statistical Significance We use the William\u2019s test to calculate statistical sig- nificance of the difference in performance between each LM evaluator and traditional metric (Graham and Baldwin, 2014). We report the p-values in Table 9. The difference in Pearson correlation be- tween Llama 3.3 70B, the best performing model, the traditional metrics is statistically significant, ex- cept for DCRS and CLI. The Pearson correlation difference between the LM evaluators and FKGL, the most popular metric, is statistically significant, except Llama 3.1 8B. The Kendall-Tau values show that the Mistral, Mixtral, and Gemma models are statistically significant over most of the tradi- tional metrics. This supports our suggestions from \u00a7 5.2, in which we recommend using a combination of the best performing traditional metrics (DCRS and CLI) with LM evaluators, while discontinuing the use of FKGL. 16 LW Spache FRE ARI GFI DCRS CLI FKGL Mistral 7B 6.51E-04 0.02 0.05 0.01 0.05 0.19 0.18 0.02 Mixtral 7B 6.90E-04 0.01 0.03 0.01 0.04 0.16 0.15 0.02 Gemma 7B 9.65E-04 0.02 0.03 0.01 0.04 0.17 0.15 0.02 Llama 3.1 8B 2.00E-03 0.04 0.14 0.03 0.10",

To enable this, we introduce a novel continuous speech tokenizer that, when compared to the popular Encodec model, improves data compression by 80 times while maintaining comparable performance. The tokenizer effectively preserves audio fidelity while significantly boosting computational efficiency for processing long sequences. Thus, VIBEVOICE can synthesize long-form speech for up to 90 minutes (in a 64K context window length) with a maximum of 4 speakers, capturing the authentic conversational \u201cvibe\u201d and surpassing open-source and proprietary dialogue models.

Although traditional systems can technically pro- duce such audio by concatenating individually synthesized utterances, achieving natural turn-taking and content-aware generation are major challenges. Recently, research on multi-speaker long conver- sational speech generation has begun to emerge [Goo24, PSJ+24, Nar25, Ope25, Ses25, LWI+24]. However, most of these works are either not open-sourced [Goo24, PSJ+24] or still face challenges in terms of generation length",
    "synthesized utterances, achieving natural turn-taking and content-aware generation are major challenges. Recently, research on multi-speaker long conver- sational speech generation has begun to emerge [Goo24, PSJ+24, Nar25, Ope25, Ses25, LWI+24]. However, most of these works are either not open-sourced [Goo24, PSJ+24] or still face challenges in terms of generation length and stability [ZQW+25, Ses25, JYY+25, Ope25]. In this work, we introduce VIBEVOICE, as illustrated in Figure 2, a novel framework developed for the scalable synthesis of long-form and multi-speaker speech. To support long audio generation, we have pioneered the development of a causal speech tokenizer that achieves a 3200\u00d7 compression rate (i.e., 7.5 Hz frame rate). In our experiments, this highly efficient tokenizer maintains a speech- to-text token ratio of approximately 2:1, meaning two speech tokens are roughly equivalent to one BPE [SHB15] text token. We utilize a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM, e.g., Qwen2.5 [YYZ+24]) to interpret complex user inputs, including detailed text sentences and role assignments. We have streamlined the architec- ture by removing unnecessary prior designs: voice latent features and text scripts are concatenated into a single sequence and fed directly into the LLM. The LLM then processes this context to predict a hidden state, which in turn conditions a lightweight, token-level Diffusion Head [LTL+24]. This diffusion head is responsible for predicting the continuous Variational Autoencoder (VAE) features, which are subsequently recovered into the final audio output by speech tokenizer decoder. Despite its architectural simplicity, VIBEVOICE yields an exceptionally powerful TTS model. It demonstrates remarkable flexibility in handling multiple speakers and achieves a synthesis length of up to 90 minutes. Scaling the LLM from 1.5B to 7B, the larger model exhibits significant gains in perceptual quality, delivering richer timbre, more natural intonation, and enhanced transfer capabilities, such as in cross-lingual applications. 2 2 Method 2.1 Speech Tokenizers We employ two separate tokenizers as input to learn both acoustic and semantic features. In our experiments, generating long-form speech benefits from this separate design. Acoustic Tokenizer adopts the principles of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) [KW14], specifically drawing inspiration from the \u03c3-VAE variant proposed in LatentLM [SBW+24] to mitigate potential variance collapse issues of VAEs when used in autoregressive modeling settings. The process involves an encoder network, parameterized by \u03d5, which maps the input audio x to the parameters of a latent distribution, primarily the mean \u00b5. Notably, variance \u03c3 is a pre-defined distribution (N(0, C\u03c3)) in \u03c3- VAE, rather than a learnable distribution in VAE [KW14]. A latent vector z is then sampled using the reparameterization trick. Following the \u03c3-VAE approach to ensure robust variance for autoregressive modeling, we can formulate this as: z = \u00b5 + \u03c3 \u2299\u03f5, where \u03f5 \u223cN(0, 1), \u03c3 \u223cN(0, C\u03c3). The architecture is",
    "than a learnable distribution in VAE [KW14]. A latent vector z is then sampled using the reparameterization trick. Following the \u03c3-VAE approach to ensure robust variance for autoregressive modeling, we can formulate this as: z = \u00b5 + \u03c3 \u2299\u03f5, where \u03f5 \u223cN(0, 1), \u03c3 \u223cN(0, C\u03c3). The architecture is a mirror-symmetric encoder-decoder structure. The encoder employs a hierarchical design with 7 stages of modified Transformer blocks [VSP+17] (using 1D depth-wise causal convo- lutions instead of self-attention module) for efficient streaming processing. Six downsampling layers achieve a cumulative 3200X downsampling rate from a 24kHz input, yielding 7.5 tokens/frames per second. Each encoder/decoder component has approximately 340M parameters. The training objective follows the DAC [KSL+23], including its discriminator and loss designs. Semantic Tokenizer mirrors the hierarchical architecture of the Acoustic Tokenizer\u2019s encoder, but without VAE components, as its objective is deterministic content-centric feature extraction. The main difference is the training objective, which uses Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) as the proxy task. During training, its output is decoded by several Transformer decoder layers to predict text transcripts, aligning the semantic encoder\u2019s representations with textual semantics. This decoder is discarded after pre-training. 2.2 VIBEVOICE VIBEVOICE employs a Large Language Model (LLM) as its core sequence model, integrated with specialized audio encoding and diffusion-based decoding modules to achieve scalable, high-fidelity multi-speaker speech synthesis. The overall inference architecture is depicted in Figure 2. Input Representation: The model input X is formed by concatenating the voice font features and the text script embeddings, specified by users, interleaved with role identifiers (Speakerk): X = [Speaker1 : z1, Speaker2 : z2, ..., SpeakerN : zN] + [Speaker1 : T1, Speaker2 : T2, ..., SpeakerN : TN], where zN is acoustic latent representations and TN is each role\u2019s text scripts. For the generated speech segment s, it will be encoded by acoustic tokenizer and semantic tokenizer to form the hybrid speech representation for the auto-regressive modeling. Token-Level Diffusion: To synthesize speech in a streaming way, VIBEVOICE employs a lightweight diffusion head [LTL+24] conditioned on the LLM\u2019s hidden state of each token, hi. During training, this diffusion head is optimized to reverse a forward noising process by predicting the noise [HJA20] added to the clean acoustic VAE features za,i. During inference, this diffusion head iteratively refines a randomly sampled Gaussian noise vector to predict the target acoustic VAE feature, za,i. This denoising process is enhanced using Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which interpolates between a conditional prediction (guided by hi) and an unconditional prediction. An efficient sampler, such as DPM-Solver++ [LZB+22, LZB+25], is utilized to accelerate this iterative process, ultimately yielding a clean acoustic feature estimate. We instantiated VIBEVOICE\u2019s core LLM using the 1.5B and 7B parameter versions of Qwen2.5 [YYZ+24]. The",

We instantiated VIBEVOICE\u2019s core LLM using the 1.5B and 7B parameter versions of Qwen2.5 [YYZ+24]. The diffusion head [LTL+24] comprises 4 layers. During VIBEVOICE training, the pre-trained acoustic and semantic tokenizers remained frozen, with only the LLM and diffusion head parameters being learnable. We employed a curriculum learning strategy for the LLM input sequence length, progressively increasing from 4,096 to 65,536 tokens. The guidance scale is 1.3 and the iterative denoising step is 10 for VIBEVOICE. 3 Model Subjective Objective Realism Richness Preference Average WER (Whisper) WER (Nemo) SIM Nari Labs Dia [Nar25] - - - - 11.96 10.79 0.541 Mooncast [JYY+25] - - - - 2.81 3.29 0.562 SesameAILabs-CSM [Ses25] 2.89 \u00b11.15 3.03 \u00b11.11 2.75 \u00b11.08 2.89 \u00b11.12 2.66 3.05 0.685 Higgs Audio V2 [Bos25] 2.95 \u00b11.13 3.19 \u00b11.06 2.83 \u00b11.16 2.99 \u00b11.13 5.94 5.97 0.543 Elevenlabs v3 alpha [Ele] 3.34 \u00b11.11 3.48 \u00b11.05 3.38 \u00b11.12 3.40 \u00b11.09 2.39 2.47 0.623 Gemini 2.5 pro preview tts [Goo] 3.55 \u00b11.20 3.78 \u00b11.11 3.65 \u00b11.15 3.66 \u00b11.16 1.73 2.43 - VIBEVOICE-1.5B 3.59 \u00b10.95 3.59 \u00b11.01 3.44 \u00b10.92 3.54 \u00b10.96 1.11 1.82 0.548 VIBEVOICE-7B 3.71 \u00b10.98 3.81 \u00b10.87 3.75 \u00b10.94 3.76 \u00b10.93 1.29 1.95 0.692 Table 1: Human subjective and objective evaluation results.

To manage the labor-intensive and time-consuming nature of subjective evaluation, we designed a compact test set. This set consists of 8 long conversational transcripts with a total duration of about 1 hour. We used speech prompts to ensure consistent timbre across the different models. Since Gemini 2.5 Pro preview TTS does not support speech-prompt control, we used its default male and female voices for comparison instead. For our objective evaluation, we measure Word Error Rate (WER) and speaker similarity. WER is obtained by transcribing the generated speech using Whisper-large-v3 [RKX+23] and Nemo ASR [XJM+23]. Speaker similarity (SIM) is computed by extracting speaker embeddings with WavLM-large [CWC+22]. For subjective evaluation, we recruited 24 human annotators to provide Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) across three dimensions: Realism (how natural and human-like the speech sounds, including prosody, emotion, and the smoothness of speaker turns), Richness (the expressiveness of the speech in terms of tone and emotion, including variation and adaptation to context), and Preference (overall",
    "24 human annotators to provide Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) across three dimensions: Realism (how natural and human-like the speech sounds, including prosody, emotion, and the smoothness of speaker turns), Richness (the expressiveness of the speech in terms of tone and emotion, including variation and adaptation to context), and Preference (overall listener enjoyment and subjective preference, reflecting naturalness, pleasantness, and engagement). The evaluation covered six models with all eight test samples, meaning that each annotator listened to approximately six hours of audio in total. We can observe that: The proposed VIBEVOICE models outperform all other top-tier models on long conversational speech generation across both objective and subjective metrics. Com- pared with the VIBEVOICE-1.5B model, the VIBEVOICE-7B model achieves significantly better performance on all objective metrics and SIM, while maintaining a comparable WER. 3.2 VIBEVOICE Short Utterance We evaluate VIBEVOICE on the SEED test sets [ACC+24b], a widely used benchmark composed of short utterances. For evaluation, approximately 1,000 English samples and 2,000 Chinese samples are drawn from the CommonVoice dataset, denoted as test-en and test-zh, respectively. We compute word error rate (WER) using Whisper-large-v3 for test-en and Paraformer [GZMY22] for test-zh. For speaker similarity (SIM), we adopt a WavLM-large [CWC+22] model. Table 2 presents the results on the SEED test sets. Although our model is primarily trained on long-form speech, it demonstrates strong generalization on short-utterance benchmarks. In addition, by employing a lower frame rate, our model substantially reduces the number of decoding steps required to synthesize one second of speech. 4 Model Frame Rate test-zh test-en CER(%) \u2193 SIM \u2191 WER(%) \u2193 SIM \u2191 MaskGCT [WZL+24] 50 2.27 0.774 2.62 0.714 Seed-TTS [ACC+24b] - 1.12 0.796 2.25 0.762 FireRedTTS [GLS+24] 25 1.51 0.635 3.82 0.460 CosyVoice 2 [DWC+24b] 25 1.45 0.748 2.57 0.652 Spark TTS [WJM+25] 50 1.20 0.672 1.98 0.584 VIBEVOICE-1.5B 7.5 1.16 0.744 3.04 0.689 Table 2: Results on the SEED test sets.

Best results are in bold. 3.3 Tokenizer Reconstruction The fidelity of audio reconstructed from acoustic tokens is a critical indicator of the tokenizer\u2019s efficacy in preserving essential acoustic information, particularly under high compression rates. To quantify this, we measured PESQ [RBHH01], STOI [THHJ10] and UTMOS [SXN+22] on both the LibriTTS test-clean and test-other datasets [ZDC+19]. Table 3 shows that our acoustic tokenizer, uniquely operating at an ultra-low 7.5 Hz, achieves leading PESQ and UTMOS scores on both test-clean (PESQ: 3.068, UTMOS: 4.181) and test-other (PESQ: 2.848, UTMOS: 3.724) subsets. This demonstrates its capacity for high-fidelity, perceptually excellent audio reconstruction despite aggressive compression, which is a key factor for VIBEVOICE\u2019s scalability with long-form audio. 4 Conclusion, Limitations, and Risks We introduced VIBEVOICE, a novel framework for long-form and multi-speaker speech generation. By integrating efficient hybrid speech representations from specialized ultra-low frame rate (7.5 Hz) acoustic and semantic tokenizers with an end-to-end LLM-based next-token diffusion framework, VIBEVOICE achieves state-of-the-art performance. It scalably synthesizes high-quality audio for up to 90 minutes with up to 4 speakers, demonstrably surpassing existing baselines in both subjective perceptual quality\u2014including preference, realism, and richness\u2014and objective metrics like WER, thereby significantly advancing the capabilities of conversational TTS. English and Chinese only: Transcripts in languages other than English or Chinese may result in unexpected audio outputs. Non-Speech Audio: The model focuses solely on speech synthesis and does not handle background noise, music, or other sound effects. Overlapping Speech: The current model does not explicitly model or generate overlapping speech segments in conversations. Potential for Deepfakes and Disinformation: High-quality synthetic speech can be misused to create convincing fake audio content for impersonation, fraud, or spreading disinformation. Users 5 must ensure transcripts are reliable, check content accuracy, and avoid using generated content in misleading ways. We do not recommend using VIBEVOICE in commercial or real-world applications without further testing and development. This model is intended for research and development purposes only.

    "Demystifying Scientific Problem-Solving in LLMs by Probing Knowledge and Reasoning Alan Li1* Yixin Liu1* Arpan Sarkar2 Doug Downey3,4 Arman Cohan1,4 1Yale University, 2Harvard University, 3Northwestern University, 4Allen Institute of AI {haoxin.li,yixin.liu}@yale.edu Abstract Scientific problem solving poses unique chal- lenges for LLMs, requiring both deep domain knowledge and the ability to apply such knowl- edge through complex reasoning. While auto- mated scientific reasoners hold great promise for assisting human scientists, there is currently no widely adopted holistic benchmark for eval- uating scientific reasoning, and few approaches systematically disentangle the distinct roles of knowledge and reasoning in these tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce SCIREAS, a diverse suite of existing benchmarks for sci- entific reasoning tasks, and SCIREAS-PRO, a selective subset that requires more complex reasoning. Our holistic evaluation surfaces in- sights about scientific reasoning performance that remain hidden when relying on individual benchmarks alone. We then propose KRUX, a probing framework for studying the distinct roles of reasoning and knowledge in scientific tasks. Combining the two, we conduct an in-depth analysis that yields several key find- ings: (1) Retrieving task-relevant knowledge from model parameters is a critical bottleneck for LLMs in scientific reasoning; (2) Reason- ing models consistently benefit from external knowledge added in-context on top of the rea- soning enhancement; (3) Enhancing verbalized reasoning improves LLMs\u2019 ability to surface task-relevant knowledge. Finally, we conduct a lightweight analysis, comparing our science- focused data composition with concurrent ef- forts on long CoT SFT, and release SCILIT01, a strong 8B baseline for scientific reasoning.1 1 Introduction Recent frontier reasoning models, such as Ope- nAI\u2019s o-series (OpenAI et al., 2024) and DeepSeek- R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025), demonstrate sig- nificant advances by leveraging increased test- time compute to enable intermediate reasoning *These authors contributed equally to this work. 1The codebase and artifacts are released at https:// github.com/yale-nlp/SciReas-Eval. steps (Wei et al., 2023; Kojima et al., 2023). These approaches facilitate advanced mechanisms, includ- ing methodology exploration (Yao et al., 2023), self-verification (Ma et al., 2025a), and backtrack- ing (Yang et al., 2025b), resulting in improvements on tasks such as mathematics and coding with more test-time compute (Muennighoff et al., 2025). These advances in reasoning capabilities open up opportunities for applying LLMs to complex sci- entific tasks (Lu et al., 2024; Gottweis et al., 2025; Schmidgall et al., 2025). However, scientific work demands not only rigorous reasoning but also deep domain knowledge, from specialized concepts and foundational theories to hands-on methodological expertise and familiarity with obscure yet pivotal findings. Successful scientific reasoning systems must apply such knowledge in complex multi-step reasoning processes (Zhao et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023a; Wadden et al., 2024a; Li et al., 2025). While a variety of scientific benchmarks ex-",

Successful scientific reasoning systems must apply such knowledge in complex multi-step reasoning processes (Zhao et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023a; Wadden et al., 2024a; Li et al., 2025). While a variety of scientific benchmarks ex- ist (e.g., GPQA (Rein et al., 2024) and MMLU- Pro (Wang et al., 2024b)), there is no holistic and unified benchmark that comprehensively targets sci- entific reasoning. Existing individual benchmarks typically focus narrowly on specific domains, task formats, or skill types. For example, although GPQA is challenging, it focuses exclusively on multiple-choice questions within a limited range of domains. Furthermore, there is a lack of analytical tools that can isolate the distinct roles that reason- ing and scientific knowledge play when performing sophisticated scientific tasks. We introduce datasets and methods to facili- tate the study of scientific problem solving. First, we present SCIREAS, a unified suite of ten pub- lic benchmarks that span physics, chemistry, biol- ogy, medicine, materials, mathematics, computer science, and engineering, with multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, structured, and protocol/procedu- ral questions. To improve evaluation efficiency and sharpen the focus on reasoning difficulty, we manu- 1 arXiv:2508.19202v1 [cs.CL] 26 Aug 2025 Question Q: While operating on variable frequency supplies, the AC motor requires variable voltage in order to ____.

Reasoning R + Answer A: <think> Okay, so I need to figure out why an AC motor requires variable voltage when operating on variable frequency supplies \u2026 </think>\u2026Therefore, the answer is (C). k1: The synchronous speed of an AC motor is proportional to the ratio of supply frequency to the number of motor poles. k2: Induction motors require maintenance of a constant voltage-to-frequency ratio for optimal operation. k3: Maintaining constant voltage while decreasing supply frequency increases magnetic flux, risking core saturation. \u2026 Question w/ KIs Question Q: \u2026 Here are some knowledge points that could be helpful: - k1 - k2 - k3 \u2026 Base-Math Base-STEM Base-BOTH DeepSeek-R1 Base KI Extractor Knowledge Ingredients (KIs) Base-Math Base-STEM Base-BOTH Base RQ1, 2 RQ3 Response Knowledge Source Evaluated Model Figure 1: KRUX pipeline. Starting from the upper left, we prompt an LLM (one of base, DeepSeek-R1, Base-Math, Base-STEM, and Base-BOTH) with a question from SCIREAS as knowledge source, collect the output and reasoning traces, and feed the reasoning traces to DeepSeek-R1 as the extractor to generate knowledge ingredients (KIs).

We then evaluate the tested model with KI-augmented questions, which allows us to study three key research questions (RQ1, RQ2, RQ3) regarding LLMs\u2019 knowledge and reasoning capabilities in scientific problem-solving. ally inspect each subtask and retain only those that are subject-relevant and reasoning-intensive, while preserving broad domain coverage. Furthermore, to facilitate standardized evaluation, we provide an efficient and unified implementation of streamlined assessment across individual benchmarks, avoid- ing the need to set up different environments or dataset-specific boilerplate for each dataset (\u00a73). Next, we introduce SCIREAS-PRO, a compact subset of SCIREAS tailored for evaluating more challenging reasoning. Specifically, SCIREAS- PRO is constructed by selecting examples from SCIREAS where only reasoning models with high inference-time compute budget (or the highest al- lowed number of thinking tokens) succeed. We find that despite containing only 8% as many examples as SCIREAS, SCIREAS-PRO better differentiates weak and strong reasoners (\u00a73). Having constructed the reasoning-intensive sci- entific benchmarks, our next goal is to leverage them to study how verbalized chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning affects knowledge recall and usage (\u00a74). To study this, we design KRUX (Knowledge & Reasoning Utilization eXams), a probing frame- work which supplies models with atomic \u201cknowl- edge ingredients\u201d (KIs) extracted from other mod- els\u2019 reasoning traces. This technique allows for more controlled analyses of reasoning and knowl- edge, which we use to perform three in-depth in- vestigations that lead to the following findings: (1) Vanilla instruct models can outperform their reasoning counterparts by \u226510% once KIs are provided in-context, suggesting that internaliz- ing and retrieving the right knowledge is a key bottleneck for scientific reasoning tasks. (2) When both model families receive the same KIs from a strong reasoner (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), the reasoning-fine-tuned models consistently out- perform the base models, showing that reason- ing models are capable of utilizing external in- context knowledge for additional improvements. (3) Feeding KIs from a reasoning-fine-tuned model to its base model can boost performance even when the KIs are already known by the base model, indi- cating that reasoning-fine-tuning aids knowledge recall by surfacing more relevant knowledge. Our contributions can be summarized as: \u2022 We introduce SCIREAS, a unified and holistic benchmark suite spanning a broad range of scien- tific domains and problem types, allowing us to surface insights that otherwise remain hidden if relying on individual datasets only. We also re- lease a reasoning-focused subset SCIREAS-PRO that allows efficient benchmarking of sophisticated reasoning with more room for improvement. \u2022 We present KRUX, a novel analytic frame- work which we use to conduct a comprehensive empirical study that disentangles the impacts of knowledge and reasoning. \u2022 We provide an in-depth analysis with three key",

We support these findings with controlled post-training experiments. Finally, to foster the development of open-source scientific reasoning models, we conduct light- weight analyses comparing our Math+STEM data 2 composition with concurrent long CoT supervised fine-tuning (SFT) post-training efforts, and release SCILIT01, a strong scientific reasoning baseline built on Qwen3-8B-Base (Yang et al., 2025a). 2 Related Work Scientific Benchmarks Existing scientific bench- marks span a wide array of domains and tasks, but each tends to focus on specific disciplines or sub- skills, often lacking explicit emphasis on multi-step reasoning or standardized implementation. For example, most tasks in SciRIFF (Wadden et al., 2024a) focus on context-grounded information QA, rather than demanding reasoning. Benchmarks like GPQA (Rein et al., 2024) and LabBench (Lau- rent et al., 2024) pose reasoning challenges, yet they cover only a limited range of scientific do- mains and rely on multiple-choice QA formats. Implementation-wise, benchmarks lack standard- ized prompts, evaluation metrics, or consistent scor- ing, making reproducibility and fair comparison difficult (Gu et al., 2025; Gao et al., 2024). To address this fragmentation, our study system- atically incorporates 10 prominent scientific bench- marks, GPQA, MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024b), SuperGPQA (Team et al., 2025b), LabBench, OlympiadBench (He et al., 2024), SciBench (Wang et al., 2023b), SciRIFF, UGPhysics (Xu et al., 2025), SciEval (Sun et al., 2024), and SciKnowE- val (Feng et al., 2024), enabling a unified, compre- hensive, and reproducible evaluation of scientific reasoning capabilities. Knowledge & Reasoning An important line of work on disentangling reasoning and knowledge designs specialized tasks (e.g., linguistically chal- lenging questions (Bean et al., 2024; Khouja et al., 2025) or synthetic multi-hop questions (Li and Goyal, 2025)) to isolate reasoning from knowl- edge, but such benchmarks are often artificial and domain-constrained. Notably, Li and Goyal (2025) analyzes the synergy between knowledge and rea- soning as knowledge evolves, offering a perspec- tive complementary to our controlled CoT SFT experiments. Another line of work trains exter- nal classifiers to label questions as reasoning- or knowledge-intensive based on parametric mod- els (Thapa et al., 2025). However, this approach requires well-calibrated training data and does not consider the tested model\u2019s internal knowledge; for instance, a question labeled as requiring rea- soning might be directly memorized by the model.

However, this approach requires well-calibrated training data and does not consider the tested model\u2019s internal knowledge; for instance, a question labeled as requiring rea- soning might be directly memorized by the model. Concurrent work leverages reasoning traces to eval- uate factual correctness (Wu et al., 2025), but fo- cuses on surface-level factuality rather than gen- uine knowledge recall. With KRUX, we extract answer-agnostic, atomic knowledge points directly from models\u2019 reasoning traces and evaluate their effect under controlled availability. Unlike prior work that trains external classifiers to label ques- tion types or checks surface factuality in traces, KRUX holds knowledge constant and varies the target model, isolating knowledge recall from rea- soning ability without relying on heuristic difficulty tags. Additional related work is provided in Ap- pendix A. 3 Benchmarking Knowledge-Intensive Scientific Reasoning Given limited coverage in terms of domain, for- mats, or accessibility for individual benchmarks, SCIREAS solves this by merging ten datasets under one standardized harness, offering broad domain coverage and consistent evaluation. SCIREAS SCIREAS is a unified evaluation suite focused on reasoning-intensive scientific tasks cu- rated from 10 representative existing benchmarks. Through task-level filtering, SCIREAS reduces in- stance count by nearly 50% while preserving cov- erage, and, inspired by OLMES (Gu et al., 2025), provides a unified implementation optimized with vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023) and batch job APIs2 for scalable, easy-to-use, and efficient evaluation. Our curation prioritizes subtasks from each benchmark that demand not only specific domain knowledge but also complex, multi-step reasoning processes for resolution. For each subtask from each benchmark, we manually inspect at least 20 instances. We manually determine (1) whether the given task requires an in-depth understanding of domain-specific scientific knowledge beyond the information provided in-context, and (2) whether multi-step reasoning is necessary to reach the cor- rect answer. We incorporate tasks only if all 20 sampled instances fulfill both requirements.3 To keep evaluation cost-efficient under compute constraints, we uniformly sample 200 instances from each subtask sourced from high-cost bench- marks \u2014 MMLU-Pro, SciKnowEval, SciEval, and 2We provide batch job inference options for popular LLM providers, e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, TogetherAI, and Gemini. Using batch APIs allows for up to 50% cost reduction. 3While this manual inspection can be subjective, the judg- ment is based on the authors\u2019 graduate-school-level expertise. 3 $1.0 $10 $100 Cost per 1k instances (USD, log scale) 0.525 0.550 0.575 0.600 0.625 0.650 0.675 0.700 SciReas Performance (Avg) Families DeepSeek V3/R1 Gemini 2.5 Pro o3 Qwen3 32B o3 Mini Claude Sonnet 4 GPT 4.1 o4 Mini Grok3 Grok3 Mini Llama 4 Maverick GPT OSS 120B GPT 5 Variant High/Thinking Low/Non-Thinking Figure 2: Frontier reasoning models\u2019 performance evaluated on SCIREAS.",

Benchmarks affected by our filtering are marked with an aster- isk (*); their scores are not directly comparable to those from prior work. SCIREAS-PRO Although SCIREAS provides a uniform measurement for model performance on scientific reasoning tasks that nominally require scientific reasoning, the difficulty of individual in- stances is uneven: some can be answered with little or no deductive effort once the pertinent fact is recalled, as shown in an example in Figure 3. To isolate the reasoning skill, we therefore cu- rate a \u201chard\u201d subset \u2014 those questions whose solu- tions still demand multi-step inference even when all relevant knowledge is available \u2014 so that any performance gains cannot be explained by knowl- edge recall alone. Building on our observation in \u00a73.1.1, we hypothesize that the performance dif- ference under different test-time inference budgets can serve as an effective indicator of reasoning intensity. Specifically, instances where reasoning models fail with low reasoning budget but succeed with high budget likely require complex reasoning processes, even when the necessary domain knowl- edge is accessible to the model in both settings. In practice, we evaluate o3-mini and o4-mini on SCIREAS with both high and low \u201creasoning-effort\u201d settings \u2014 an OpenAI API flag that limits the num- ber of thinking tokens before the answer. For o3- mini and o4-mini, the high-effort setting costs at least 5.8\u00d7 more per instance than the low-effort setting (Table 6, Appendix B.1).4 For each model, we keep questions answered incorrectly under low effort but correctly under high effort and take the 4Because these models are proprietary, factors beyond the flag may influence performance. We therefore treat the flag as a practical, not absolute, proxy and validate it with an independent LLM-judge study (Appendix B.3.2). 4 GPQA LabBench* MMLU-Pro* OlympiadBench SciBench SciEval* SciKnowEval* SciRIFF* SuperGPQA* UGPhysics* GPQA LabBench* MMLU-Pro* OlympiadBench SciBench SciEval* SciKnowEval* SciRIFF* SuperGPQA* UGPhysics* 1.00 0.86 0.86 0.78 0.59 0.32 0.43-0.080.92 0.66 0.86 1.00 0.77 0.58 0.42 0.27 0.51 0.15 0.69 0.52 0.86 0.77 1.00 0.78 0.69 0.35 0.17 0.10 0.82 0.68 0.78 0.58 0.78 1.00 0.64 0.24-0.110.04 0.75 0.36 0.59 0.42 0.69 0.64 1.00 0.28 0.02-0.030.63 0.46 0.32 0.27 0.35 0.24 0.28 1.00-0.08-0.090.30 0.04 0.43 0.51 0.17-0.110.02-0.081.00 0.02 0.33 0.43 -0.080.15 0.10 0.04-0.03-0.090.02 1.00-0.15-0.28 0.92 0.69 0.82 0.75 0.63 0.30 0.33-0.151.00 0.71 0.66 0.52 0.68 0.36 0.46 0.04 0.43-0.280.71 1.00 (a) SciReasBench Correlation 0.55 0.60 0.65 0.70 SciReasBench Average 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.60 0.65 0.70 SciBench Score (b)SciReasBench vs SciBench( = 0.71) 0.55 0.60 0.65",

We further validate this approach by using LLM judge as well as human evaluation to check the reasoning- intensiveness of resulting examples from this filter- ing pipeline. Appendix B.3 shows that both human annotators and LLM judges find SCIREAS-PRO to be indeed richer in reasoning-intensive instances. 3.1 Benchmarking Frontier Models Having constructed SCIREAS and SCIREAS-PRO with focus on scientific reasoning tasks, we now examine how state-of-the-art models perform un- der varying computational budgets. We evaluate frontier models using different \u201creasoning-effort\u201d settings (see configuration details in Appendix C). These settings typically correspond to significant differences in output length, with high-effort modes producing substantially more reasoning tokens as they work through complex problems. 5 3.1.1 Results Aggregated Results Figure 2 highlights aggre- gated performance and rankings evaluated on SCIREAS, with score breakdowns on selected mod- els shown in Table 6. Notably, the aggregated ranking provides additional insights that differ from popular individual benchmarks. Compar- ing o3-High and Gemini-2.5-Pro-Preview-High as an example, o3-High wins on GPQA and MMLU- Pro* while Gemini-2.5-Pro-Preview-High wins on SuperGPQA*, all with a thin margin (within 1 ab- solute point, even evaluated on MMLU-Pro before uniform sampling as shown in Figure 7). Simi- larly, GPT-5-High shows on-par performance with 5In this work, we refer to DeepSeek-R1-0528 and DeepSeek-V3-0324 simply as DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek- V3, respectively, unless otherwise specified.

Evaluated across SCIREAS, however, we notice that GPT-5-High outperforms its competitors on a broader range of benchmarks. Meanwhile, o3-High achieves higher overall performance over Gemini- 2.5-Pro-Preview-High, with superior performance on LabBench* and weaker on OlympiadBench by a large margin (beyond 10 absolute points).

Benchmark Correlations In general, as the Pear- son correlation analysis shows in Figure 4 (a), while some benchmarks are closely correlated (e.g., GPQA and SuperGPQA*), benchmarks containing free-form QA and fill-in-the-blank questions like SciRIFF* and SciEval* are not highly correlated with GPQA-like multiple-choice tasks, demonstrat- ing the need for a holistic evaluation suite. Isolating specific benchmarks, we observe that models from different providers may be tuned explicitly for specific tasks or skills. As shown in Figure 4 (b) and (c), Qwen3-32B-Thinking strikes noticeably above the trend on SciBench, reaching comparable performance to commercial frontier models. Similarly, DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek- R1-0120 demonstrate stronger performance on MMLU-Pro*, indicating capabilities that surpass their overall rankings. Performance Gap by Reasoning Difference Al- though the gap varies depending on different model families and providers, the same model can ex- hibit a significant performance gap under differ- ent reasoning settings. For instance, as shown in Figure 2, o3-mini-Low and -High show a perfor- mance gap of 6.8 on the aggregated average.

This observation motivates the construction of SCIREAS-PRO, leveraging the performance gap be- tween low and high reasoning efforts as an effective proxy for identifying instances that demand com- plex reasoning rather than mere knowledge recall. For practitioners, task-specific evaluation is still recommended for the optimal balance between inference cost and performance. Amplified Performance Gap As shown in Figure 5, SCIREAS-PRO amplifies performance gaps between low- and high-reasoning settings, where the gap between GPT-5-High and GPT-5- Low widens from 3.01 to 12.22, and the corre- sponding gap for Gemini-2.5-Pro-Preview widens from 0.35 to 2.30. Meanwhile, non-reasoning mod- els, e.g., GPT-4.1, DeepSeek-V3, show more signif- icant gaps on SCIREAS-PRO compared to concur- rent reasoning models, i.e., o3 and DeepSeek-R1, respectively. 4 Disentangling Knowledge and Reasoning in Scientific Tasks While SCIREAS and SCIREAS-PRO provide uni- fied benchmarks to evaluate scientific reasoning capabilities, another fundamental question remains unanswered: how does CoT reasoning adapta- tion affect a model\u2019s ability to recall and utilize knowledge?

To address this question, we first con- duct a series of controlled SFT experiments on high-quality reasoning traces with and without in- domain scientific knowledge, and then we propose KRUX, a novel investigative framework to study three key research questions regarding the role of knowledge in scientific reasoning using the fine- tuned checkpoints.

This allows us to at- tribute behavior changes to the data mixture rather than confounding factors. For training, we leverage the SYNTHETIC- 1 (Mattern et al., 2025) dataset, an existing large- scale dataset released by Prime Intellect,6 which consists of outputs of DeepSeek-R1-0120, includ- ing the reasoning traces, on a diverse set of tasks. More specifically, we leverage the mathematics and STEM subsets from SYNTHETIC-1 (denoted as SYNTHETIC-1-Math/STEM, respectively). The former provides reasoning traces on abstract math reasoning questions, serving as a source for long CoT adaptation without introducing in-domain knowledge. In contrast, the latter is sourced from StackExchange (Lambert et al., 2023), providing a more in-domain data source for a broader range of scientific subjects.7 The math subset contains around 462K instances, while the STEM subset contains around 512K instances. Details of the training and evaluation setup are in Appendix D. By training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on 6https://huggingface.co/PrimeIntellect 7Notably, SYNTHETIC-1-Math is sourced from competition-level math problems, highlighting high- quality abstract math reasoning filtered by verified answers. In contrast, StackExchange and SYNTHETIC-1-STEM provide more realistic problem-solving data from wider subjects, offering more coverage in science domains. 6 SYNTHETIC-1 (-Math, -STEM, and the combined subsets), we derived Qwen-Math, Qwen-STEM, and Qwen-BOTH along with their counterparts trained from Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct.

In the follow- ing, we will refer to the base models as Qwen or Llama for brevity. Compared with concurrent work on long CoT post-training (Bercovich et al., 2025a; Face, 2025; Mattern et al., 2025; Ma et al., 2025b), our checkpoints deliver comparable performance under controlled settings (Table 1), serving as reliable investigating checkpoints. 4.2 Knowledge & Reasoning Utilization Exam (KRUX) We introduce KRUX (Figure 1), a novel inves- tigative framework to study the role of knowledge and long CoT reasoning in scientific problem solv- ing. To separate what a model knows from how it reasons, we hold knowledge availability fixed by injecting compact, answer-agnostic knowledge ingredients (KIs) in-context. In the framework, we extract KIs from the reasoning traces of various models and provide these KIs in-context to LLMs when evaluating them. Consequently, gains over a no-KI baseline indicate a knowledge-retrieval bot- tleneck, while persistent errors point to reasoning limits. We first introduce our pipeline to extract KIs from reasoning traces (\u00a74.2.1), and then dis- cuss how we analyze and apply extracted KIs to test knowledge recall (\u00a74.2.2, \u00a74.2.4) and usage (\u00a74.2.3). For experiments, we prioritize challeng- ing benchmarks (i.e., GPQA, MMLU-Pro*, and LabBench*), which have been widely used by pre- vious work in the field on tasks that require scien- tific expertise. 4.2.1 Knowledge Ingredient (KI) Extraction First, to analyze the role of knowledge in models\u2019 performance on scientific problem-solving, we aim to study a setting in which the model is given the requisite knowledge in-context. Specifically, we take the reasoning traces from a reasoning model as the knowledge source and use a strong reasoning- focused LLM (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) to extract the essential atomic knowledge units that comprise it, which we refer to as knowledge ingredients (KIs) (Figure 1). We provide the extraction prompt and example KIs in Appendix E.1. We then augment the original question by prepending the extracted KIs in-context and ask the models to solve the same problem. We perform additional checks to ensure that KIs are relevant to the problem and do not leak any part of the final answer. In manual review, all ex- tracted KIs met these criteria and were consistent with their source reasoning traces. To prevent the extractor from hallucinating or introducing extra- neous facts (i.e., KIs unsupported by the source trace or unnecessary for solving the problem), we feed the generated KIs back to the source model and measure performance. If performance changes materially, this indicates potential leakage of steps or answers. Empirically, we observe no signifi- cant change (Table 2, Base vs. w/",
    "(i.e., KIs unsupported by the source trace or unnecessary for solving the problem), we feed the generated KIs back to the source model and measure performance. If performance changes materially, this indicates potential leakage of steps or answers. Empirically, we observe no signifi- cant change (Table 2, Base vs. w/ Base KIs), sug- gesting the KIs are answer-agnostic and faithful to the trace. Further, although it is possible that the knowledge pieces may be irrelevant to the so- lution, as shown in recent studies of CoT faithful- ness (Turpin et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024c,a), recent high-performing models like DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated strong reasoning adherence on benchmark tasks (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025). Our experiments show that the knowledge pieces help models on reasoning tasks. See Figures 12-14 in Appendix E.1 for KI examples generated by differ- ent models for the same question. Centered on our primary research objective on the roles of knowledge recall and utilization in rea- soning models, we examine the following key re- search questions: RQ1: To what extent can base models benefit from high-quality external knowl- edge? RQ2: Do reasoning-enhanced models bene- fit from external knowledge? RQ3: Does reason- ing fine-tuning improve a model\u2019s ability to surface helpful knowledge? 4.2.2 RQ1: To what extent can base models benefit from high-quality external knowledge? Problem Statement. We investigate the potential improvement from external knowledge by provid- ing KIs to the base models in the prompt when performing scientific reasoning (Figure 1). Here, we focus on two sources for the KIs, which are ex- tracted from their own CoT traces (w/ Base KIs) or from DeepSeek-R1\u2019s CoT traces (w/ R1 KIs). To overcome context sensitivity, we report averages and standard deviations across 5 runs with corre- sponding KIs permuted randomly. We then investi- gate whether there are significant gaps between base models augmented with additional KIs in the context, and their corresponding reasoning- fine-tuned models. To this end, comparisons are 7 Setup GPQA LabBench* Qwen 35.27 32.38 w/ Qwen KIs 34.24 \u00b1 0.93 30.93 \u00b1 1.43 w/ R1 KIs 47.19 \u00b1 1.53 41.40 \u00b1 2.46 Qwen-STEM 41.63 31.75 Qwen-Math 39.47 30.18 Qwen-BOTH 40.81 33.83 General-Reasoner 35.94 35.58 Llama 28.13 33.55 w/ Llama KIs 29.06 \u00b1 1.44 34.40 \u00b1 2.58 w/ R1 KIs 43.57 \u00b1 0.88 42.27 \u00b1 1.60 Llama-STEM 38.95 36.04 Llama-Math 36.16 34.78 Llama-BOTH 39.43 36.61 Llama-Nemotron 37.95 27.78 Table 2: Performance on GPQA and LabBench* with base models alone, base models with knowledge ex- tracted from DeepSeek-R1 or itself (w/ {R1, Base} KIs), and base models with reasoning-fine-tuning.

Best and second best average scores are labeled in bold and un- derlined, respectively. Reasoning models fall behind base models augmented with in-context knowledge. made with reasoning-fine-tuned models trained on our controlled data mixtures and the ones from con- current work (i.e., General-Reasoner-7B (Liu et al., 2025) and Llama-Nemotron-Nano-8B (Bercovich et al., 2025b)) that involve SFT and reinforce- ment learning based on the same base models (i.e., Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, respectively). Answer to RQ1: As an upper bound, a base model with high-quality in-context knowledge can substantially outperform its reasoning- enhanced counterpart. As shown in Table 2, base models provided with KIs from DeepSeek- R1 are able to outperform base models alone or Base w/ Base KIs setup by \u226520%, and outperform reasoning variants without KIs by \u226510% across different benchmarks and model families, showing the external knowledge provides greater gain than reasoning fine-tuning. The fact that a base model without strong reasoning capabilities can outper- form reasoning models in this setting indicates a potential deficiency of the models in knowledge recall that hinders their performance in scientific reasoning. 4.2.3 RQ2: Do reasoning-enhanced models benefit from external knowledge? Problem Statement. Observing considerable im- provements from adding external knowledge ingre- dients from DeepSeek-R1 to base models in RQ1, we hypothesize similar improvements would scale on reasoning-enhanced models, offering additional gains on top of enhanced reasoning capabilities. To this end, we evaluate base and CoT SFTed vari- ants on KIs extracted from DeepSeek-R1, provid- ing the same necessary knowledge extracted from DeepSeek-R1\u2019s reasoning traces (w/ R1 KIs). As the baseline for comparison that is not provided with added knowledge, we instead offer the tested models with KIs extracted from their own CoT traces (w/ self KIs). Answer to RQ2: Yes. the reasoning models also substantially benefit from addition of contex- tual knowledge. As shown in Table 3, within both Qwen and Llama groups, reasoning-enhanced models w/ R1 KIs in the context show significant improvements over the base setting without the KIs, while preserving the gap compared with the base model w/ R1 KIs. Confirming the effectiveness of providing external knowledge as an in-context prompt, this result sheds light on potential future improvement by applying high-quality external memory modules as an external knowledge source for better problem-solving capabilities, echoing the finding in COMPACTDB (Lyu et al., 2025), a con- current effort constructing a high-quality datastore for reasoning-intensive tasks. We note, however, that in these experiments, we do not distinguish between two possible non- exclusive explanations for the improvement from adding R1 KIs. (a) It may be that the R1 KIs pro-",

We note, however, that in these experiments, we do not distinguish between two possible non- exclusive explanations for the improvement from adding R1 KIs. (a) It may be that the R1 KIs pro- vide new key knowledge absent from the model\u2019s parameters, or (b) the model may already possess these facts but struggle to retrieve them (put another way, once a strong reasoning model supplies the key facts, the reasoning search space might narrow and the problem becomes easier, whether or not the model originally \u201cknew\u201d the augmented facts). We further analyze this confounder in RQ3. 4.2.4 RQ3: Does reasoning fine-tuning improve a model\u2019s ability to surface helpful knowledge? Problem Statement. While we observe that ex- ternal knowledge benefits reasoning models, in this RQ, we ask how reasoning-fine-tuning affects knowledge recall. To this end, we focus on eval- uating the KIs from -Math models to determine whether they offer more more improvement than those of base models, since -Math models are fine- tuned on math-only data without additional scien- tific knowledge.

Base models and math reasoning-fine- tuned models show similar performance on knowledge recall questions, demonstrating no explicit in-domain knowledge injection. variants, trained with SYNTHETIC-1-STEM, out- perform -Math variants due to science in-domain training data, -Math variants also largely outper- form the base model even without being trained on science data. Recalling our discussion in RQ2 (\u00a74.2.3), the -Math model\u2019s gains have the same two non-exclusive explanations, (a) some science questions require mathematical knowledge, and the -Math model performs better on these because math knowledge was loaded into the model through the math-specific fine-tuning, and/or (b) the -Math model is better at surfacing its relevant parametric knowledge via CoT expression. To disentangle these two factors, we extract KIs from the CoTs of the -Math models and examine whether these KIs represent new knowledge added by fine-tuning, or whether they are also facts known to the base model. We probe this by querying the model with synthetic questions that test knowledge of each KI (see Appendix E.2 for prompts and examples). Then, to verify explanation (b), we provide the KIs in-context from either the -Math or base model, to the corresponding base model; i.e., holding mathematical reasoning capacity constant while varying only the external knowledge.

KIs extracted from -Math models enable more improve- ment over those from base models. Answer to RQ3: Yes. In response to explanation (a), we find that on average, the base models and their corresponding -Math variants have similar re- call of the KIs (Table 4), meaning that explanation (a) is unlikely to be the major contributor for the improvements. To verify explanation (b), Table 5 shows that KIs from -Math deliver significant boosts over those from the base models across different benchmarks and model families. This result suggests that CoT verbalization improves the model\u2019s ability to iden- tify and surface the most relevant latent knowledge for the given reasoning problems. Notably, the KIs are unlikely to have been newly acquired during fine-tuning (Table 4); instead, the findings indicate that reasoning-fine-tuned models exhibit improved recall of knowledge already parameterized in",

Notably, the KIs are unlikely to have been newly acquired during fine-tuning (Table 4); instead, the findings indicate that reasoning-fine-tuned models exhibit improved recall of knowledge already parameterized in the base model. 5 Training Knowledge Enhanced Scientific Reasoning Models Our analyses conducted so far are based on models fine-tuned on either SYNTHETIC-1-Math, SYNTHETIC-1-STEM, or both, while combining the two, which cover both STEM and mathematical reasoning, achieves the strongest performance. To further assess the effectiveness of this Math+STEM 9 data mixture following \u00a74.1, we compare it di- rectly against concurrently released long-CoT SFT datasets on the same base model. We then ap- ply the same mixture to Qwen3-8B-Base to obtain SCILIT01 to provide a stronger baseline. Specifically, we compare Qwen-BOTH, which is fine-tuned using our training recipe, with SYNTHETIC-1-SFT (Mattern et al., 2025), a model fine-tuned on SYNTHETIC-1 with additional cod- ing and preference alignment data, and Qwen- Nemotron, a model we trained with the same settings and same amount of data (\u00a74.1) sam- pled from science and math domains of Llama- Nemotron (Bercovich et al., 2025b), a training data mixture for reasoning fine-tuning, all post-trained on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. The results in Table 10 show that our data composition yields a stronger baseline for scientific reasoning than concurrent data recipes on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (Table 10 center block), and Qwen-BOTH reaches compara- ble performance to models from concurrent efforts focusing on reasoning enhancement post-training recipes (Table 10 left-hand block, i.e., OpenR1 (Face, 2025), Llama-Nemotron (Bercovich et al., 2025b), and General-Reasoner (Ma et al., 2025b)). Furthermore, using our recipe, we fine-tune the recently released Qwen3-8B-Base to deliver a stronger model, SCILIT01. While its perfor- mance falls behind Qwen3-8B with the thinking mode, which has undergone more sophisticated post-training, it outperforms Qwen3-8B with non- thinking mode (Table 10 right-hand block). This indicates that SCILIT01 partially unleashes the rea- soning capabilities from the base model, offering a strong baseline for future study on post-training recipe for scientific reasoning. 6 Conclusion In this work, we studied how reasoning and do- main knowledge each contribute to scientific rea- soning in large language models. To this end, we introduced SCIREAS, a unified, reproducible suite for evaluating scientific reasoning across domains and formats, and SCIREAS-PRO, its reasoning-intensive subset. With our evaluation suite, we show that despite the universal applica- bility of modern LLMs, different LLMs can have distinct strengths, and differences in inference bud- get could lead to a significant performance gap on the same model. Therefore, we recommend that practitioners conduct task-specific evaluations to achieve an optimal balance between cost and per- formance in real-life use cases. We",

Therefore, we recommend that practitioners conduct task-specific evaluations to achieve an optimal balance between cost and per- formance in real-life use cases. We also introduced KRUX, a knowledge- controlled evaluation framework that assesses LLMs with provided knowledge ingredients (KIs), revealing important insights regarding the en- hanced knowledge utilization and recall enabled by reasoning-fine-tuning. We showed: (i) retriev- ing task-relevant knowledge from parameters is a key bottleneck \u2014 base instruct models can sur- pass reasoning-tuned models once supplied with high-quality KIs; (ii) reasoning-fine-tuned models still benefit from the same external KIs, suggesting complementary gains from explicit knowledge ac- cess; and (iii) verbalized CoT improves knowledge surfacing \u2014 KIs extracted from math-only reason- ing models help the corresponding base models more than base-derived KIs, even when no new domain knowledge is introduced. Our results show that reasoning-focused fine-tuning improves both reasoning and knowledge use, suggesting promis- ing future directions in better understanding and enhancing these interconnected components. Limitations Our KRUX framework and KI extraction meth- ods depend on strong models like DeepSeek- R1 for generating reasoning traces. While we used an open-weight model, which provides more transparency and interpretability, the KI extrac- tion pipeline may introduce unobservable biases (though risk is minimal due to our focus on scien- tific domains), unwanted leakage of information about the answer, or inconsistencies in the faithful- ness of the KIs to the task. To mitigate this, we conducted manual analysis of the KIs, confirming their relevance and no direct answer leakage, but extracted KIs could occasionally be irrelevant or incomplete, especially if deployed at scale. Fur- thermore, some of our analyses are confounded by factors such as context sensitivity (addressed via permutations) and the impact of constraining the search space when providing KIs, which we inter- pret as an upper bound but may overestimate pure recall benefits. We have taken measures to mitigate these and discussed the caveats in our discussion of results with more details. Our experiments focus on moderate-sized LLMs with <10B parameters, specifically open-weight models (Qwen2.5, Llama3.1). While we delib- erately selected two model families and models 10 large enough to exhibit non-trivial reasoning per- formance, this limits the generalizability of our findings to larger models. Experimenting with larger models represents a straightforward exten- sion but requires significantly greater computa- tional resources, beyond the scope of our current study and our available compute resources.

The benchmarks we examine emphasize STEM fields, which may underrepresent interdisciplinary or emerging scientific research areas. We acknowl- edge potential data contamination issues that may impact our analysis; however, the nature of our study is analytical, and we perform controlled ex- periments. In our benchmarks, we also mitigate these concerns by focusing on recent 2024\u20132025 datasets. Despite these constraints, our methodol- ogy provides a systematic framework for evaluating domain-specific reasoning that can be extended to address these limitations in future work.

A Extended Related Work Evaluating Knowledge of LLMs Early efforts tended to evaluate the LM knowledge frontier with a static unified benchmark (Petroni et al., 2021). However, given the growing training corpus for pushing LLM performance, quantifying the knowl- edge frontier of LLMs becomes increasingly chal- lenging, making it difficult to design a unified benchmark. Instead of general knowledge evalua- tion, recent work approaches the knowledge fron- tier of LLMs by anchoring on specific entities, proposing methods to quantify knowledge and fac- tuality around given entities (Gottesman and Geva, 2024; Cohen et al., 2023). With recent development of reasoning LLMs, more work exploits long CoT traces as evidence of explicit knowledge utiliza- tion, verifying knowledge recall in CoT traces for factuality (Wu et al., 2025). Nevertheless, directly evaluating CoT traces can result in false positive signals on the knowledge boundary, given that the knowledge involved could be factual but not help- ful for problem solving (Arcuschin et al., 2025). In our framework, we construct controlled settings and protocols to evaluate whether the knowledge is genuinely helpful for problem-solving, implicitly guaranteeing the factuality and relevance. Reasoning LLMs Recent work has shown that LLMs can be trained to utilize intermediate tokens for reasoning, achieving better performance on rea- soning tasks as the decoding budget increases. Ope- nAI\u2019s o-series (OpenAI et al., 2024) represents the landmark of this paradigm among commercial fron- tier models, followed by DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek- AI et al., 2025) and several recent efforts to re- produce this success without releasing the training data, such as QwQ (Team, 2025) and Kimi (Team et al., 2025a). Some recent initiatives aim to achieve the same goal using fully open data sources, led by Llama-Nemotron from NVIDIA (Bercovich et al., 2025b) and SYNTHETIC-1 from Prime Intel- lect (Mattern et al., 2025), releasing post-training data to foster development within the community. Our work builds on these commitments, sharing the vision",
    "recent initiatives aim to achieve the same goal using fully open data sources, led by Llama-Nemotron from NVIDIA (Bercovich et al., 2025b) and SYNTHETIC-1 from Prime Intel- lect (Mattern et al., 2025), releasing post-training data to foster development within the community. Our work builds on these commitments, sharing the vision of improving model reasoning by leveraging intermediate tokens, while emphasizing our focus on scientific domains rather than on mathematics or general logical reasoning. LLMs for Science Recent advancements in sci- entific LLMs have transitioned from early domain- specific pretraining (e.g., Beltagy et al. 2019; Lee 14 et al. 2020), to more comprehensive models with multiple stages of training, e.g., SciGLM (Zhang et al., 2024), SciLitLLM (Li et al., 2025), and Om- niScience (Prabhakar et al., 2025). On the other hand, reasoning models have shown strong per- formance on scientific tasks such as GPQA and MMLU-Pro (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025; OpenAI et al., 2024), and some recent efforts instrument LLMs to separate recall from deduction during in- ference (Wang et al., 2025; Jin et al., 2025). How- ever, we still lack a clear understanding of the fac- tors underlying performance on scientific tasks, such as knowledge acquisition or improved rea- soning capabilities. We aim to address this gap by studying these factors and then providing a recipe for training more capable models in science.

B.3 SCIREAS-PRO Reasoning Intensiveness Validation To test this hypothesis, we pursue two complemen- tary checks: (1) different reasoning models should have high agreement identifying reasoning inten- sive instances, and (2) filtered instances should agree with human judgment in terms of reasoning Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 05 06 Low O3 High O3 Low Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 05 06 High O4 Mini High Claude Sonnet 4 20250514 O3 Mini High O4 Mini Low O3 Mini Low Model 0.82 0.83 0.84 0.85 0.86 0.87 0.88 0.89 Performance Score 0.878 \u00b10.0015 0.878 \u00b10.0016 0.866 \u00b10.0015 0.855 \u00b10.0016 0.853",

Values above bars show mean performance, while values below bars indicate the precision (half-width of confidence intervals). intensiveness. B.3.1 Cross-Model Agreement on Reasoning Intensity To validate our hypothesis that performance gaps between different reasoning effort settings indi- cate reasoning intensity, we first examine whether different models agree on which instances are reasoning-intensive. As shown in Figure 1, for each reasoning model, we categorize each test question from SCIREAS by their correctness un- der low/high reasoning efforts into four categories, (high_c, low_c), (high_c, low_i), (high_i, low_c), and (high_i, low_i), where high/low stands for high/low reasoning effort setting and *_c/*_i stands for the problem instance has been 16 answered correctly/incorrectly by the model. Treat- ing (high_c, low_i) as targeting instances that require high reasoning effort, we measure how (high_c, low_i) sets derived from different rea- soning models agree with others. As shown in Table 7, treating (high_c, low_i) from o3-mini as ground truth, the same set derived from o4-mini, o3, and claude-sonnet-4 largely co- incide with o3-mini across different benchmarks from SCIREAS (all above 70%), showing high agreement on instances that require high reasoning efforts across models from different model fami- lies.

Different reasoning models agree on high reasoning instances. B.3.2 Human and LLM-as-Judge Assessment The overlap of instances that require high reasoning effort shows reasoning models tend to agree on problem difficulty, but to verify the reliability of reasoning effort as a surrogate, the filter should also align with human judgment. To this end, we collect the union of (high_c, low_i) from o3-mini and o4-mini for the case study and apply an LLM-as-judge assess- ment (Zheng et al., 2023) to expedite the process while manually annotating a subset for",
    "effort as a surrogate, the filter should also align with human judgment. To this end, we collect the union of (high_c, low_i) from o3-mini and o4-mini for the case study and apply an LLM-as-judge assess- ment (Zheng et al., 2023) to expedite the process while manually annotating a subset for a reliability test. The LLM judge is based on GPT-4.1 for a balanced tradeoff between assessment reliability and cost. Notably, naively prompting the LLM judge to determine the reasoning difficulty could be suboptimal due to a lack of reference. There- fore, we designed two reference-based evaluation protocols: (a) pair-wise comparison on reasoning difficulty between instance questions sampled from filtered subset and original SCIREAS, and (b) iden- tifying failing reason for filtered instances given low and high reasoning outputs (i.e., whether the model fails in a low reasoning setting due to lack of reasoning effort). (a) Pairwise Comparison For each instance in SCIREAS-PRO, the judge is also presented with an instance drawn from the set of other, non- overlapping instances from SCIREAS. The judge is not given any information as to which instance is drawn from which source and is tasked to identify which instance is more reasoning-intensive.

C Frontier Model API Evaluation Configuration For OpenAI and xAI provided reasoning models, we apply generic \u201clow\u201d and \u201chigh\u201d reasoning effort parameters with respect to official documentation where specificity on token budget is not allowed; for other reasoning models that allows thinking budgets as input (e.g. Gemini and Anthropic), we adopt \u201clow\u201d as definition introduced by LiteLLM,8 which corresponds to 1024 budget, and remove the constraint to allow for as many thinking tokens as the model needed to unleash full potential as \u201chigh\u201d reasoning effort, corresponding to the highest rea- soning effort from OpenAI and xAI models. For all frontier reasoning models, if not restricted, we set temperature=1, borrowed from OpenAI forced setting,9 and top-p=0.95, borrowed from recom- mended setting by Anthropic,10 with max genera- tion length of 64K, as we observe no models tend to output more than 20K tokens.

    "as we observe no models tend to output more than 20K tokens. We log API pricing at the time of writing in Table 8. D Training / Evaluation Hyperparameter D.1 Distillation from Reasoning LLMs To obtain high-performing reasoning models for study, we employ a distillation method that fine- tunes smaller models using Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) on the CoT trajectories generated by large reasoning models, as it is more effective than rein- forcement learning (RL) with the small models alone (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025). Specifically, we consider the standard SFT framework for lan- guage models where the objective is to train a model f\u03b8 to approximate a distribution over output sequences y conditioned on input x, based on a dataset D = {(xi, yi)}N i=1. For recent reasoning LLMs such as DeepSeek-R1, the output y consists of two main parts: a reasoning trace r and the actual output a. In practice, the reasoning traces are en- closed by keywords <think> and </think>, indi- cating the start and the end of the reasoning process. The model is trained with the standard SFT ob- jective: L(\u03b8) = \u2212\u03a3(x,y)\u2208D\u03a3|y| t=1 log p\u03b8(yt|y<t, x), where yt is the t-th token and y<t is its prefix. 8https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/anthropic#usage\u2014 thinking\u2013reasoning_content 9https://community.openai.com/t/o3-mini-unsupported- parameter-temperature/1140846/3 10https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with- claude/extended-thinking#feature-compatibility 18 Model Input Price ($ per 1M tokens) Output Price ($ per 1M tokens) OpenAI models GPT-4.1-2025-04-14 2.00 8.00 o3-mini-2025-01-31 1.10 4.40 o3-2025-04-16 2.00 8.00 o4-mini-2025-04-16 1.10 4.40 GPT-5-2025-08-07 1.25 10.00 GPT-oss-120B (Together AI) 0.15 0.60 DeepSeek models DeepSeek-V3-0324 0.14 0.28 DeepSeek-R1-0120 0.55 2.19 DeepSeek-R1-0528 0.55 2.19 Alibaba Qwen models (Together AI) Qwen3-32B 0.40 1.20 Google models Gemini-2.5-Pro-Preview-05-06 1.25 10.00 Meta models (Together AI) Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8 0.27 0.85 Anthropic models Claude-Sonnet-4-20250514 3.00 15.00 Table 8: Pricing ($ per 1M tokens) for input and output across different LLM providers at the time of writing, without any discounts. D.2 Extended Setup D.2.1 Training Settings We filter out instances with a token length greater than 4096.11 The models are trained for 5 epochs with a cosine learning rate scheduler, a maximum learning rate of 1e-5, and 3% warmup steps. D.2.2 Evaluation setup The reasoning models could produce excessively long outputs, and may be prone to self-repetition with greedy decoding (DeepSeek-AI, 2025). In this work, unless otherwise specified, we apply greedy decoding on non-CoT fine-tuned models and top- p=0.95, temperature=0.6 on reasoning models, with a maximum generation length of 64K. From our preliminary studies, we observe that the setup generally reflects the best performance for both set- tings, and the decoding setup matches the recom- mended setup from recent efforts in large reasoning models, such as Llama-Nemotron (Bercovich et al., 2025a). Notably, for Qwen (Yang et al., 2024) models and their variants, we apply YaRN context extension (Peng et",

Notably, for Qwen (Yang et al., 2024) models and their variants, we apply YaRN context extension (Peng et al., 2023) as recommended by the official model card (Team, 2024). D.3 Extended Baseline Results Recent efforts that leverage SYNTHETIC-1 or simi- lar data with reasoning traces for training reasoning 11Longer input lengths would slow down our training in quadratic order based on 8 80GB A100/H100 GPUs. LLMs often incorporate data spanning from math to coding (Mattern et al., 2025) without focusing on science-related tasks, providing hard-to-analyze synergy and suboptimal performance in scientific reasoning (see SYNTHETIC-1-SFT in Table 10). As shown in Table 1, Qwen-STEM and Qwen- Math both exhibit significant improvement over the base model on SCIREAS and SCIREAS-PRO. Qwen-Math slightly outperforms Qwen-STEM on SCIREAS and the gap is amplified on SCIREAS- PRO. Given limited subject coverage on SYNTHETIC- 1-Math dataset, the strong performance of check- points fine-tuned on it only seems surprising \u2014 Does the improvement come from generalization from math reasoning to a wider domain, or is it be- cause the high-reasoning instances in our datasets are math-intensive? To answer this question, we categorize SCIREAS-PRO into math and non-math instances by heuristics. Specifically, we label in- stances as math-needed if they contain explicit nu- meric quantities that typically imply computation. Importantly, numbers that appear solely within unit expressions (e.g., \u201ccm2\u201d) or chemical formu- las (e.g., \u201cH2O\u201d or \u201cNaCl\u201d) are not treated as in- dicators of math-related reasoning. Full details are provided in Appendix D.3.1. As shown in Ta- ble 9, we find that math computation appears fre- quently among reasoning-intensive instances, and the improvements on SCIREAS-PRO mostly come 19 from improved math capabilities. For non-math instances, -math variants hardly improve, while - STEM variants and -BOTH variants, trained with STEM subjects data, show noticeable improve- ments. Model Math Acc. Non-Math Acc.

E Extended KRUX Details E.1 Knowledge Extraction In this work, we apply DeepSeek-R1 as the ex- tractor. Prompt shown in Figure 11. We show a set of KIs extracted from Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (Figure 12), Qwen-Math variants (Figure 13), and DeepSeek-R1 (Figure 14) for the same question from GPQA: Question: A large gene has dozens of exons, of which the central ones code for folded triple helical repeats that connect the cytoskeleton with sarcolemma and extracellular space. Each exon usually codes for one folded triple alpha helix. The most common mutations of the gene are central exon deletions that create out-of-frame peptides and progressive degenerative organ waste. A solution is to deliver a Morpholino that recognizes the 5\u2019 end of the out-of-frame exon in pre-mRNA. The molecule prevents binding of the spliceosome and creates exon skipping and in-frame joining. Several missing exons are well tolerated by an organism. Which structure below is not involved in the proposed therapy? (A) lariat (B) antisense (C) R-loops (D) polyA tail. 20 Models OpenR1 Llama-Nemotron General-Reasoner SYNTHETIC-1-SFT Qwen-Nemotron Qwen-BOTH Qwen3-SYNTHETIC-1 Qwen3 Qwen3-thinking Base Model Q2.5-Math L3.1-Inst.

USER MESSAGE You are given a reasoning chain that explains and jus- tifies a particular conclusion or answer. Your task is to extract **all distinct knowledge pieces** from this chain. A knowledge piece is any standalone statement conveying an explicit fact, definition, mechanism, re- lationship, or insight that can be generalized beyond the specific question. ## Instructions: 1. Read the entire reasoning chain. 2. Identify each discrete fact or insight expressed. 3. Rewrite each as a self-contained, generalizable sentence. 4. Do **not** include any contextual or example- specific details. 5. Output **only** a list of those sentences. ## Output Format: \u2022 knowledge-Piece-1 \u2022 knowledge-Piece-2 \u2022 ... ## Reasoning Chain: {{REASONING}} ## Now perform the extraction. Figure 11: Full knowledge extraction prompt template used in our experiments. 21 KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION OUT- PUT Based on the reasoning chain, here are all distinct knowledge pieces: 1. R-loops are structures formed when a strand of RNA hybridizes with its complementary DNA strand, displacing the other DNA strand. 2. Morpholino can prevent spliceosome binding. 3. Preventing spliceosome binding can lead to exon skipping. 4. Exon skipping can result in in-frame joining of exons. 5. The process of using Morpholino to induce exon skipping does not involve R-loops. Figure 12: Example KIs extracted from Qwen2.5-7B- Instruct. KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION OUT- PUT Based on the reasoning chain, here are all distinct knowledge pieces: 1. Morpholino oligonucleotides can bind to the 5\u2019 splice site of pre-mRNA to block spliceosome recognition. 2. Blocking spliceosome binding prevents normal intron removal and leads to exon skipping. 3. Exon skipping can enable in-frame joining of ad- jacent exons, preserving the reading frame. 4. Antisense molecules function by complementary base-pairing to specific RNA sequences to modu- late splicing. 5. Lariat structures are formed during canonical splic- ing via branch site interactions but are absent when spliceosome activity is inhibited. 6. R-loops are",

Lariat structures are formed during canonical splic- ing via branch site interactions but are absent when spliceosome activity is inhibited. 6. R-loops are DNA-RNA hybrid structures unrelated to spliceosome-mediated exon skipping mecha- nisms. 7. The polyA tail is added post-transcriptionally and is not directly involved in splice site selection or exon skipping processes. Figure 13: Example KIs extracted from Qwen-Math. KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION OUT- PUT Based on the reasoning chain, here are all distinct knowledge pieces: 1. Morpholinos are antisense oligonucleotides that bind to complementary RNA sequences. 2. The spliceosome recognizes splice sites on pre- mRNA through components like U1 snRNP, which binds to the 5\u2019 splice site. 3. Blocking spliceosome access to a splice site pre- vents recognition of exon boundaries and causes exon skipping. 4. Exon skipping can restore the reading frame by joining exons flanking the skipped exon. 5. Functional proteins may be produced if skipped exons encode non-critical regions and the remain- ing exons maintain an in-frame sequence. 6. Lariat structures form during canonical splicing when introns are removed via branch site cleavage. 7. R-loops are nucleic acid structures involving RNA- DNA hybrids and are not directly involved in spliceosome-mediated splicing. 8. Antisense oligonucleotide therapies rely on sequence-specific binding to pre-mRNA targets. 9. Polyadenylation (polyA tail addition) occurs dur- ing mRNA maturation and is unrelated to splice site selection or exon skipping mechanisms. Figure 14: Example KIs extracted from DeepSeek-R1.

Our approach defines three compositional axes: Theme (e.g., effi- ciency, adaptivity), Domain (e.g., question answering, machine translation), and Method (e.g., adversarial training, linear attention). These elements represent high-level abstractions common in scientific work\u2014motivations, problem settings, and technical approaches\u2014and serve as building blocks for LLM-driven exploration. We mine elements from human experts or conference papers and show that prompting LLMs with curated combi- nations produces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current literature. This modern thinking machine offers a lightweight, interpretable tool for augmenting scientific creativity and suggests a path toward collaborative ideation between humans and AI. 1 Introduction There is a growing interest in the machine learning community in leveraging large language models (LLMs) to accelerate scientific discovery (Si et al., 2024; AI4Science & Quantum, 2023; Collins et al., 2024; Singh et al., 2025; Jansen et al., 2025; Si et al., 2025). Among these prominent directions, one challenging topic is to use LLMs to conduct or assist the ideation process. Despite recent success in ideation with state-of-the-art language models (Si et al., 2024), community simulation (Yu et al., 2024), and reinforcement learning (Li et al., 2024), model-generated ideas can lack diversity (Si et al., 2024). In response, in this paper, we ask: Does conditioning on explicit concept combinations help build a minimalist pipeline for diverse and grounded research ideas? An ideal pipeline shall be simple, scalable, and it can generate a diverse set of ideas. In this work, we propose to create such a pipeline through revisiting one of the first human explorations of artificial intelligence invented at the end of the thirteenth century, which aims at creating new knowledge from logical combinations of concepts (Borges, 1937). Llull\u2019s machine includes multiple rotary disks of concepts, e.g., goodness, power, glory, etc, where Llull believed studying all combinations of the elementary concepts would help understand a field of knowledge that can be covered by them. In light of the thinking, we revisit the idea of element combination to create a modern version for LLM ideation. Specifically, we design three disks of elements theme, domain, and method. Corresponding research ideas are then synthesized with a finite set of rules combining all elements1. For example, with less is more as a theme, confidence calibration",

For example, with less is more as a theme, confidence calibration as a domain, Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2024) as a method, and a simplest A+B+C template, after rewriting the raw idea with Claude 3.7 (Anthropic, 2024), a candidate idea can be: Less Parameters, Better Calibration: Confidence- Aware Training for Mamba Architectures.

We discuss this in the limitations section in the appendix. 1 arXiv:2508.19200v1 [cs.AI] 26 Aug 2025 Published as a workshop paper at COLM 2025 human-written elements and then scale the ideation with elements mined automatically from top-tier conferences, e.g., ICLR, ACL, etc. To study the characteristics of the ideas, we first compare the statistics and elements (themes, domains, and methods) extracted from different conferences across years, which sheds light on the taste and preferences of different machine learning communities, e.g., from the same number of papers, our pipeline extracts similar numbers of domain elements from ACL and more method elements from ICLR. Next, with the raw ideas combined through automatically extracted templates in the same pipeline, we further use LLMs to rewrite them into research ideas. We compare these output ideas from Ram\u00b4on Llull\u2019s Thinking Machine with idea titles from previous work (Si et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2024), which suggests good diversity and coverage of the ideas generated from our minimalist method2. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLM ideation through reconstructing the thirteenth- century Ram\u00b4on Llull\u2019s thinking machine with modern data mining and automatic evaluation techniques. We anticipate the proposed pipeline and resources to serve as (1) a simple but strong baseline for LLM ideation; (2) an interesting view that motivates human researchers to find or review their ideas. The authors acknowledge the core contribution of our work as an investigation into quantifying how much research ideation can be mechanically automated. We will open-source our code, data, and generated research ideas at https: //github.com/colinzhaoust/ramon llull public. 2 Related Work Symbolic Reasoning Ram\u00b4on Llull\u2019s thinking machine (Borges, 1937) is one of the earliest attempts at formalizing reasoning, laying the foundation for symbolic AI. It motivates later developments such as mathematized logic (Uckelman, 2010), the universal Turing machine (Turing, 1936), ontologies (Goerss, 2024) and knowledge graphs (Ji et al., 2021).

    "laying the foundation for symbolic AI. It motivates later developments such as mathematized logic (Uckelman, 2010), the universal Turing machine (Turing, 1936), ontologies (Goerss, 2024) and knowledge graphs (Ji et al., 2021). While it shares with knowledge graphs the goal of representing structured information, the key difference lies in their operational principles. Knowledge graphs capture large-scale relational structures among extracted entities. In contrast, Llull\u2019s thinking machine starts with a small and fixed set of core concepts and systematically explores their combinatorial possibilities using a rotating mechanism. This generative, combinatorial focus distinguishes it from the more static and structural nature of knowledge graphs. Automatic Ideation Recent advancements have explored the use of LLMs to automate and enhance scientific and creative ideation. The most direct approach involves prompting LLMs to generate ideas in a single pass (Si et al., 2024). Building on this, other works incor- porate more structured techniques such as iterative boosting (Wang et al., 2024), knowledge augmentation (Baek et al., 2025), multi-agent collaboration (Yu et al., 2024), reinforcement learning (Li et al., 2024), to refine ideation quality. A further step involves analogical rea- soning (Hope et al., 2017), which mines high-quality ideas from structured knowledge by drawing connections between similar concepts. Our approach moves one step beyond anal- ogy: we identify high-quality core concepts and systematically explore their combinatorial space\u2014inspired by Llull\u2019s thinking machine\u2014to generate novel and diverse ideas grounded in specific research communities. We further discuss related work on data mining from academic papers in Appendix A.2. 3 The Ram\u00b4on Llull\u2019s Thinking Machine From the historical context, Ram\u00b4on Llull designed the machine to provide answers to arbi- trary questions with a combination of elements selected through spinning three concentric and revolving wood or metal disks3. Through patient manipulation of the multiplication and elimination, the machine will eventually produce a seemingly good answer. 2The authors note that the diversity and coverage do not necessarily suggest the novelty and utility of the ideas, which require extensive human experimentation and evaluation to validate. 3We present a figurative illustration in Appendix 3 2 Published as a workshop paper at COLM 2025 hierarchical adaptive rethink self-refine memory modular grokking scaling mamba RL diffusion KV Self attention Linear models optimal transport self supervision agent planning RAG safety calibration reasoning persuasion debate Title: Scaling Up Reinforcement Learning Agents via Curriculum-Aligned Environment Synthesis Ramon Llull's Thinking Machine scaling Ideation agent RL rethink planning linear models reasoning Title: Rethinking the Divide: Comparing Planning and Reasoning with Linear Models Abstract: Scaling reinforcement learning (RL) agents to perform robustly in complex environments remains a major challenge. \u2026.. demonstrating improved performance and sample efficiency over standard scaling methods.

Element Mining Abstract Title A B C T Figure 1: The overall pipeline of using the concept of Ram\u00b4on Llull\u2019s thinking machine for research ideation. It includes three main steps (1) element mining: mining and merge elements (like keywords representing themes, domains, and methods) from papers in top conferences; (2) combinational thinking: combining extracted elements through symbolic recombination similar with Ram\u00b4on Llull\u2019s thinking machine; (3) idea generation: generating abstract-style research ideas based on templates and elements. We consider this process a simulation of one kind of human ideation process: a researcher may see a good paper and decide to apply it to their own domains, e.g., the recent success in introducing teacher forcing to diffusion (Chen et al., 2024)4. There is no guarantee on if this ideation process is the best in terms of novelty, but it shall be considered as a common practice in various communities. In a formal way, given three disks of elements A = {a1, a2, ...}, B = {b1, b2, ...}, C = {c1, c2, ...} and a template T 5, Ram\u00b4on Llull\u2019s Thinking Machine \u03d5 outputs the raw idea x = \u03d5(A, B, C, T), where T can require \u22651 elements from each disk. Then, given a large language model m, following the setup of (Si et al., 2024), we denote the ideation as the generation of a title and a corresponding abstract, (t, abs) \u223cm(x). We show our pipeline of element mining and ideation in Figure 1, with details in the following sections. At this stage, we leave sampling execution plans from the raw idea to future work. 3.1 Building the Idea Generator Elements. Similar to the original thinking machine, we design three disks to capture the minimum description of the ideation context: \u2022 Theme (A): the theme of the work, which highlights a particular scene or purpose to conduct the study, e.g., less is more, few-shot, adaptive, aggregation, in-the-wild, is all you need, etc. The theme elements might be revisited with different names in the literature, where \u201ctrendy\u201d themes can also be different across communities. \u2022 Domain (B): the domain of the work, which indicates a potential set of tasks to solve and previous work to follow, e.g., argument mining, question answering, etc. \u2022 Method (C): the method of the work, which shows",

    "disks to form the minimum description of a research idea: we did a in b with c, as described in the IMRaD format of academic writing (Nair & Nair, 2014). However, elements in the disks can be non-exclusive, e.g., retrieval can be considered as a domain with various tasks, as well as a set of methods for other domains. We discuss other potential axes of the machine in Section 4.4. We further discuss the relations of the intra/inter-disk elements in Appendix A.1. Ideation. With the disks in hand, to capture the diverse relations and combinations among elements, we extend the original Ram\u00b4on Llull\u2019s Thinking Machine with templates for gen- eration, which is widely used in the knowledge graph construction (Zhang et al., 2020). A template serves as a way to combine the elements, with potential additional descrip- tive words on their relations. Besides the aforementioned \u201cwe did a in b with c\u201d, other rudimentary templates can be \u201ccompare c1 and c2 in b1 under a1\u201d or \u201cc1 is all you need\u201d. 3.2 Mining the elements and templates Pilot: Human Annotation. To validate our design of the disks, we first seek elements of the disks from PhD students from different communities6. Table 1 presents the theme, domain, and method elements written by human experts. With LLM rewriting, these elements can already lead to interesting research ideas, e.g., from hindsight, debate, RL, Claude 3.7 6Each volunteer has published 5+ papers in the conferences of the corresponding community. 4 Published as a workshop paper at COLM 2025 can output a title: Learning to Argue in Hindsight: Multi-Agent Debate with Retrospective Reinforcement Learning with a reasonable abstract. Among different communities, there are similarities, e.g., transformer and diffusion, and differences, e.g., multi-hop vs. inverse rendering. In recent years, certain ideas from one community have motivated the novel directions in other communities, e.g., transformer for vision (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) and diffusion for text (Li et al., 2022), and vice versa, which inspires us to study and auto-extraction of these elements from conferences acknowledged in different communities. Mining from the Literature. To automate and scale the element harvest, we propose to automatically mine the elements and templates from different top-tier conferences, which allows for extendability to our pipeline. Specifically, we use Gemini 2.0 Flash (Gemini Team et al., 2024) to process each paper title and abstract into lists of A, B, C, and a template with a carefully designed element extraction prompt. Upon acquiring the elements from different papers, since we observe duplications among the elements, we then leverage Gemini 2.0 Flash again to merge the elements based on the semantic similarities. The detailed prompts are presented in Appendix A.6. We collected the papers from Paper",
    "a carefully designed element extraction prompt. Upon acquiring the elements from different papers, since we observe duplications among the elements, we then leverage Gemini 2.0 Flash again to merge the elements based on the semantic similarities. The detailed prompts are presented in Appendix A.6. We collected the papers from Paper Copilot (Yang, 2025), with ICLR 24, COLM 24, COLT 24, ACL 24, ACL 23, and ACL 22 as the selected conferences to cover a diverse set of topics. We randomly sampled 2,000 papers for ICLR 24. Table 2 presents the statistics of the acquired elements. In total, we collect more than 600 elements for each category from the analysis of 7,483 papers. From the same pipeline, for ACL, the number of method elements that can be extracted from Gemini decreases over the years, e.g., noise sensitivity, multi-criteria optimization, and early exit that appear in ACL 23 no longer appear in ACL 22. With a similar number of papers analyzed, with a similar number of domain elements, ICLR 24 also covers more themes and method elements compared to ACL 2024. Example elements for other conferences are in the appendix (Table 6) We note that these elements are merged from the raw elements processed from the papers, which can potentially lead to more elements at a finer granular view, e.g., the element gener- alization is merged from generalizability, domain generalizability, and temporal generalization, which can lead to subtle but crucial changes in the paper story and experiment design. We will open-source the finer-granular elements as well as their visited counts. 3.3 Discussion With all the elements in hand, we can then generate the raw ideas by combining them with the templates. We propose two uses for the resources: (1) randomly sample a template, e.g., Compare c1 and c2 in b1 under a1, and randomly fill in the elements; (2) enumerate the top-visited elements and templates to construct a diverse set of raw ideas to fuel the studies on downstream execution or quality evaluation. We further study the characteristics of the generated ideas before and after LLM rewriting in Section 4. In our current design, we treat each equally in sampling after ranking with their visit counts from the papers. We also note that the statistical features, such as the popularity of an element or selectional preference (Zhang et al., 2019) among elements, can potentially suggest a better sampling process for the raw ideas or disk categorization. For example, we can build a Viterbi-like sampling process considering the selectional preference as the transitive scores. On the other hand, a fine-grained element sampling process can lead to a controllable ideation process, e.g., sampling the frequent elements can potentially increase the relevance to specific conferences,",

On the other hand, a fine-grained element sampling process can lead to a controllable ideation process, e.g., sampling the frequent elements can potentially increase the relevance to specific conferences, while sampling randomly can potentially increase the diversity of the ideas, which leads to a trade-off between the relevance and diversity. At the current stage, we build the pipeline with pre-defined disk types and leave the extension of the data mining and ideation pipeline for future work. 5 Published as a workshop paper at COLM 2025 ICLR2024 COLT2024 COLM2024 ACL2024 ACL2023 ACL2022 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 Density 20 40 60 80 100 Density 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 Density 20 40 60 80 100 Density 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 Density 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 Density Generated idea T-SNE distribution by Conference - Density Heatmaps Figure 2: The density heatmap visualization of ideas generated from the basic A, B, C template with top-20 most visited elements from each disk for each conference.

To avoid the noise from redundant words in the templates, we use the basic A, B, C template with the top 20 most visited elements from each disk to generate the raw research ideas. For each conference, we will have 4,000 raw research ideas. Then we convert the research ideas to TF-IDF vectors and apply t-SNE for the visualization. As presented in Figure 2, we can observe different relations among the conferences: (1) COLT 2024 ideas (green dots) are comparatively standalone, with limited coverage with 6 Published",

ICLR 2024 ideas (blue dots) have an overlap with ACL 2024 ideas, but still have a standalone area of clusters; (2) COLM 2024 ideas (red cross) lie in the intersection of ACL 2024, ICLR 2024, and COLT 2024, which shows the joint interests of language modeling from different communities, as the full name of COLM is Conference on language modeling; (3) As a sanity check, ACL 2024 and ACL 2023 ideas are largely overlapping, although shifts in interests still can lead to standalone clusters. We present an extended study on the differences of elements of ACL over the years in Appendix A.4. We further qualitatively compare the elements for ACL 2024 and ICLR 2024 in Table 3, which indicates the causes of the geometrical relations in the t-SNE visualizations: how researchers submit to different conferences show shared (e.g., LLMs and Transformers) and divergent interests (natural language inference vs. federated learning). 4.2 Comparing different ideation methods With the elements in hand, we can then generate the research ideas with LLMs rewriting. Specifically, we use Gemini-1.5 Pro to rewrite the sampled combination, for example, with element emergent, theory of mind, and variational inference, the rewritten generated idea is: Emergent Theory of Mind in Disentangled Latent Spaces via Variational Inference. We consider two variants of our thinking machine based on the sampling methods: (1) Ram\u00b4on Llull (Top): we select the most visited elements from the disks and enumerate all the combinations; (2) Ram\u00b4on Llull (Random): we randomly sample elements from all disks and ensure that each element only appear once at most. We compare these rewritten ideas from previous work on ideation: (1) Si et al. (2024) carefully sample and filter AI-generated ideas and list 93 high-quality ideas on 7 NLP topics, including Bias, Coding, Safety, Multilingual, Factuality, Math, and Uncertainty. These ideas are then used for novelty evaluation (Si et al., 2024) and execution study (Si et al., 2025); (2) Yu et al.",
    "et al. (2024) carefully sample and filter AI-generated ideas and list 93 high-quality ideas on 7 NLP topics, including Bias, Coding, Safety, Multilingual, Factuality, Math, and Uncertainty. These ideas are then used for novelty evaluation (Si et al., 2024) and execution study (Si et al., 2025); (2) Yu et al. (2024) simulate the diverse discussion in the research community and generate ideas in a question-and-answer format. To allow fair comparison. We select 100 ideas from Yu et al. (2024) from the batch where discussions are based on certain previous papers. To allow fair comparison, we select 100 ideas from each of our thinking machine variants with elements extracted from ACL 20247. We only compare the sampled research idea titles for all the methods. We consider various metrics to compare the ideation methods, including diversity, similarity, and relevance to certain conference papers. For diversity, we follow (Li et al., 2015) to use distinct-1 as a metric, the number of distinct unigram count normalized by the total number of words to capture the diversity of concise titles. For future work involving abstract or sections, the metric of diversity can be extended to entropy-based metrics as described in Zhang et al. (2025). For relevance and similarity, we consider using paper titles from the main track accepted papers from ACL 2025 to ground the comparison, where the accepted papers are released 7The authors note that the comparative study is mainly set up to compare the characteristics of these ideation methods. Since the previous methods are designed to sample ideas for their own purposes: novelty evaluation (Si et al., 2024) and research community simulation (Yu et al., 2024). The results from our metrics do not suggest the superior quality of any method. Rigorous idea quality evaluation may involve extensive expert annotation and insights from execution (Si et al., 2025). 7 Published as a workshop paper at COLM 2025 Metric ACL 2024 ACL 2023 ACL 2022 ICLR 2024 COLM 2024 COLT 2024 Overall Decomp. % 99.5% 99.2% 99.2% 99.6% 100.0% 100.0% 99.5% Recon. % 17.6% 17.8% 19.9% 15.6% 11.0% 8.2% 16.4% Table 5: Bijective coverage results across conferences. after June 2025. To reduce the chance of LLMs seeing the paper titles in their training data (Gemini 1.5 Pro was released Feb 2024). Specifically, for relevance, we compute the average BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) between each generated idea and each conference paper title pair to measure how likely a generated title is relevant to the conference. For similarity, we measure how likely a research paper title in ACL 2025 is similar to a generated idea.

Similar to our experiments in Appendix A.4, we use token-level Jaccard similarity to capture the similarity of a pair of titles. We report the similarity as the average across ACL 2025 paper titles that scored the top-K highest similarities, where K equals the number of model-generated ideas. Table 4 presents the different characteristics of different automated ideation methods: Ram\u00b4on Llull (Top) that enumerates combinations of the most trending elements achieved the highest similarity and Ram\u00b4on Llull (Random) that samples random elements achieve the highest diversity, with a decrease in relevance - which demonstrates a trade-off between diversity and similarity/relevance. Our Ram\u00b4on Llull thinking machines also show lower relevance compared to human filter ideas (Si et al., 2024) or ideas from simulated discussions grounded on certain papers (Yu et al., 2024). One potential reason can be that although the random sampling of elements leads to a diverse set of ideas, they are not necessarily the direction of research acknowledged by the community. Future fine-grained sampling identifying the relations among the elements can be a future direction to improve the ideation process of our Ram\u00b4on Llull thinking machine. 4.3 Analysis: How much of research ideation is combinatorial? In this section, we test to what degree the ideation of machine learning research can be explained by our proposed Ram\u00b4on Llull system. To this end, we conduct a coverage analysis. This evaluation tests two complementary aspects: \u2022 Decomposition: Given a research paper title, can it be decomposed into constituent A, B, C elements from our extracted disks? We consider a research idea decomposable if Gemini 2.0 Flash successfully converts the paper title into theme, domain and method elements that our method already extracted. \u2022 Reconstruction: Given the theme, domain and method elements alone, can they be combined to approximately reconstruct the title of the original paper? We consider the research idea reconstructible if Gemini 2.0 can propose a title that is highly similar (\u2265 30% Jaccard similarity) given the extracted keywords.8 Table 5 presents our bijective coverage results across 7,483 papers from six major confer- ences. We find near-universal decomposability (99.5%): almost all research papers can be decomposed into our A+B+C framework. This validates that the three-disk design captures fundamental aspects of research ideation across machine learning communities. On the other hand, reconstructibility is limited (16.4%). That said, a non-trivial fraction of real paper ideas can already be faithfully reconstructed by combining ideas in our proposed Ram\u00b4on Llull framework. While the framework successfully captures structural building blocks that are nearly universal across machine learning",

That said, a non-trivial fraction of real paper ideas can already be faithfully reconstructed by combining ideas in our proposed Ram\u00b4on Llull framework. While the framework successfully captures structural building blocks that are nearly universal across machine learning research, we note that the specific instantiation of a research idea may still require creativity and insights that go beyond mere combination of past ideas, and researchers\u2019 prior and taste may remain essential to effectively navigate this combinatorial space. 8Additional evaluation details (e.g., prompts) are reported in A.8. 8 Published as a workshop paper at COLM 2025 4.4 Analysis: What is not covered by A+B+C? Beyond the disk view of automated ideation, we identify other dimensions of the problem as follows, to serve as potential motivations for the community: \u2022 Perturbation. Given the same set of A, B, C, the final paper can be drastically different. Akin to the trivial and non-trivial perturbation (x2 \u2192x4vs.x2 \u2192x\u22121) discussed in Huang et al. (2025), certain perturbations can potentially change the problem fundamentally. Studying pairs of ideas that have identical elements discovered in our pipeline can potentially allow a fine-grained study on the sparks of non-trivial perturbations that largely reshape the problem. \u2022 The 4th Axis. In Section 3, we build our ideation pipeline with Theme (A), Domain (B), and Method (C) as the disks. Another axis of the machine can be \u201calgorithms\u201d vs \u201canalysis\u201d. Axis C currently says that the research idea should use the specified method, but a method can be both used and studied/analyzed. With this fourth disk, the machine can cover further analysis-based work, such as adversarial examples (Szegedy et al., 2013) and edge-of-stability (Cohen et al., 2021). Such analysis work often leads to the discovery of new/revived phenomena, such as Agreement-on-the-line (Baek et al., 2022), Grokking (Power et al., 2022), and Model Collapse (Shumailov et al., 2024). \u2022 Negation. Another dimension of non-A+B+C ideas is the negation of commonly believed A+B+C, which often leads to wide community discussion, rethinking of the directions, and improved evaluation, such as the mirage of a phenomenon (Schaeffer et al., 2023), the gap between automatic and human evaluation (Durmus et al., 2022; Gehrmann et al., 2022), and the misuse of certain tools (Grusky, 2023) 5 Discussion and Future Work In this paper, we propose to create a modern Ram\u00b4on Llull thinking machine for automated ideation, which serves as a lightweight and interpretable tool to create a diverse set of LLM-generated ideas, as well as a perspective to study the commonality and differences in the human ideation process across different communities.

    "automated ideation, which serves as a lightweight and interpretable tool to create a diverse set of LLM-generated ideas, as well as a perspective to study the commonality and differences in the human ideation process across different communities. We discuss the intended usage and future work as follows: Intended Usage. The proposed Ram\u00b4on Llull thinking machine is NOT intended to (1) conduct DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service) on the current brittle reviewing system (Kim et al., 2025); (2) evaluate or attack certain human-generated ideas. Our Ram\u00b4on Llull\u2019s Thinking Machine is intended to serve as (1) a baseline for future study on ideation with a filtered set of components, i.e., theme, topics, and domains; (2) motivation for human researchers to track the field status quo and their own ideas. We plan to open-source 1,000 high-quality human-filtered ideas to conduct a stealth human study on the execution of the ideas in a human-AI collaborative manner with real research labs. Future Work. We expect to extend our pipeline through (1) evaluating the quality of the generated ideas; (2) studying the human ideation and polishing process through the lens of Ram\u00b4on Llull\u2019s Thinking Machine; (3) studying how the execution process can serve as elements or factors of sampling.

Our current evaluation is based on quantitative metrics such as diversity and community relevance. While these metrics are useful for assessing the breadth and community-alignment of the generated idea space, they could be insufficient for judging the scientific merit of individual idea under some circumstances. For instance, a generated idea that is lexically unique in terms of diversity, but could be conceptually trivial or scientifically unsound. An idea might achieve high relevance by closely mirroring existing research trends, making it plausible but potentially incremental and not truly novel. Conversely, a truly groundbreaking idea might score low on relevance because it deviates significantly from established paradigms. A more rigorous assessment requires moving beyond surface-level statistics to semantic evaluation, for which human expert judgment remains the gold standard. Experts assess ideas along critical aspects like feasibility, potential impact, and non-obviousness, providing qualitative depth that text-based metrics are not designed to capture. However, large-scale human evaluation is difficult to scale, expensive, and subject to inter-annotator variability. Securing a diverse pool of",
    "which human expert judgment remains the gold standard. Experts assess ideas along critical aspects like feasibility, potential impact, and non-obviousness, providing qualitative depth that text-based metrics are not designed to capture. However, large-scale human evaluation is difficult to scale, expensive, and subject to inter-annotator variability. Securing a diverse pool of experts capable of judging ideas across the wide range of generated topics is a major logistical challenge. LLM-as-a-judge frameworks, such as the one proposed by (Li et al., 2023) trained with carefully designed rubrics, might be biased by its training data, potentially favoring well-phrased but shallow ideas over more bad-worded but conceptually deep ones. A future direction is a hybrid evaluation pipeline that leverages our quantitative metrics for initial filtering, employs LLM-as-a-judge for scalable scoring, and incorporates targeted human experts for final validation. Organizing the elements. While our current implementation, which treats conceptual elements as independent items, has successfully generated a wide breadth of ideas, it can be further enriched by the structured relationships that exist between scientific concepts. One extension is to evolve from simple, flat lists to categorical and hierarchical structures by linking to the keywords in OpenReview or the task and method hierarchies on Papers with Code9. This would enable more granular control over ideation \u2014 for example, allowing sampling at different level of abstraction. Another possible direction is to explicitly model the exclusiveness of selection preferences to learn which combinations of themes, domains, and methods are most likely to be coherent. By integrating such structured knowledge, our system would transform into a more semantic-aware ideation that is capable of generating ideas that are both novel and conceptually sound. A.2 Extended Discussion Related Work: Data Mining from Literature Extracting structured information from academic papers is a critical research area (Zhang et al., 2024). Prior work has explored concept-level understanding through methods such as topic discovery (Lee et al., 2022) and concept matching (Kang et al., 2024), often operating over large sets of concepts using clustering or taxonomy construction. Ontology-based approaches (M\u00a8uller et al., 2004) similarly aim to organize and retrieve scientific knowledge from literature at the conceptual level. In contrast, our work focuses on identifying a small set of high-quality concepts, specifically, the theme, domain, and method of each article, that are used as rotating wheels in Llull\u2019s thinking machines. This design supports combinatorial exploration and enables ideation within and across research communities. How to view A+B+C? The same A+B+C can lead to different results and execution. For the utility and feasibility of the idea execution, it is vital to analyze why the components are complementary: e.g., why a core problem in a domain requires an architectural change or can be viewed as a specific theme. 9paperswithcode.com",

    "relevance among conferences, another interesting dimension is the distribution shift over years (Tran et al., 2020). We further compare the elements of different disks through the lens of token-level Jaccard similarity for ACL from 2022 to 2024. Table 7 shows a higher similarity in the elements from domains compared to themes or methods. One potential reason is that ACL typically lists several tracks to guide the paper submission, e.g., Question Answering and NLP applications. The Jaccard similarity does not change a lot across years, but the similarity is not high in general, which indicates the topical diversity in top-tier conferences. Besides the disappearance of method elements through the years, 15 Published as a workshop paper at COLM 2025 we can also observe the occurring interests in certain elements. For the elements that appear uniquely in ACL 2024, disk A (theme) has perspective awareness, Multi-generator, etc; disk B has Hateful Meme Detection, emotional support, etc. A.5 Example ideas from different ideation methods This section provides examples from three distinct AI-driven ideation methodologies, each producing a different kind of conceptual output. We summarize the idea and omit some details for better presentation. 16 Published as a workshop paper at COLM 2025 A.5.1 Example 1: AI Scientist This method demonstrates the LLM\u2019s capacity to generate a comprehensive, structured research plan from a single core concept. The output is an actionable roadmap detailing the necessary steps to investigate an idea for next-stage experimentation. Title: Adversarial Stereotype Dissolution Prompting: Reducing Social Biases in Large Language Models through Active Counter-Example Generation 1. Problem Statement: Large language models often generate outputs that reinforce existing stereotypes and social biases, even when attempting to be unbiased. This perpetuates harmful societal prejudices and limits the models\u2019 ability to provide fair and inclusive responses across diverse user groups. 2. Motivation: Current approaches to reducing bias in language models typically focus on avoiding or counterbalancing stereotypes... By prompting the model to generate adversarial examples that contradict stereotypes, we can encourage it to develop more nuanced and less biased representations ... 3. Proposed Method: We introduce Adversarial Stereotype Dissolution Prompting (ASDP), a technique that challenges the model to actively generate counter-stereotypical examples. The prompt structure includes: ... 4. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan: Step 1: Dataset Preparation: Create a dataset of stereotype-sensitive queries across various domains (e.g., gender, race, age, profession), Collect 100-200 such queries for a comprehensive evaluation... Step 2: Baseline Methods Implementation: Implement the following baseline methods: a) Standard prompting (direct query). b) Disclaimer prompting (adding \u201cPlease provide an unbiased response\u201d to queries). c) Counterbalancing prompting (explicitly asking for examples from different groups).

To address these challenges, we propose the instance-level adaptive propulsion of external knowledge (IA- PEK), where we only conduct the retrieval when necessary. To achieve this goal, we propose to model whether a PTLM contains enough knowledge to solve an instance with a novel metric, Thrust, which leverages the representation distribution of a small amount of seen instances. Ex- tensive experiments demonstrate that Thrust is a good measurement of models\u2019 instance-level knowledgeability. Moreover, we can achieve higher cost-efficiency with the Thrust score as the retrieval indicator than the naive usage of external knowledge on 88% of the evaluated tasks, with 26% average performance improvement.

    "Do LVLMs Know What They Know? A Systematic Study of Knowledge Boundary Perception in LVLMs Zhikai Ding1 \u2217 Shiyu Ni1,2 Keping Bi1,2 \u2020 1 State Key Laboratory of AI Safety, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences 2 University of Chinese Academy of Sciences dingzhikai158@gmail.com {nishiyu23z,bikeping}@ict.ac.cn Abstract Large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong visual question answering (VQA) capabilities but are shown to hallucinate. A reliable model should perceive its knowledge boundaries\u2014knowing what it knows and what it does not. This paper investigates LVLMs\u2019 perception of their knowledge boundaries by evaluating three types of confidence signals: probabilistic confidence, answer consistency-based confidence, and verbalized confidence. Experiments on three LVLMs across three VQA datasets show that, although LVLMs possess a reasonable perception level, there is substantial room for improvement. Among the three confidences, probabilistic and consistency-based signals are more reliable indicators, while verbalized confidence often leads to overconfidence. To enhance LVLMs\u2019 perception, we adapt several established confidence calibration methods from Large Language Models (LLMs) and propose three effective methods. Additionally, we compare LVLMs with their LLM counterparts, finding that jointly processing visual and textual inputs decreases question-answering performance, but reduces confidence, resulting in an improved perception level compared to LLMs. 1 Introduction Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are capa- ble of processing both textual and visual informa- tion simultaneously, demonstrating strong perfor- mance on visual question-answering (VQA) task (Bai et al., 2025a; Wu et al., 2024; OpenAI et al., 2024). However, when faced with questions be- yond their knowledge boundaries, LVLMs often hallucinate\u2014generating seemingly plausible but factually incorrect responses (Liu et al., 2024a; Bai et al., 2025b). This is unacceptable in safety- critical domains such as healthcare. Knowing when \u2217Work done during an internship at ICT,CAS. \u2020Corresponding author an LVLM can answer correctly not only helps us determine when to trust the model but also enables adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), triggering RAG only when the model does not know the answer, which improves both the effi- ciency and effectiveness of RAG (Ni et al., 2024a). A trustworthy model should have a clear percep- tion of its knowledge boundaries\u2014knowing what it knows and what it does not. While this ability has been extensively studied in large language mod- els (LLMs) (Xiong et al., 2024; Tian et al., 2023; Moskvoretskii et al., 2025), it remains underex- plored in LVLMs. A model\u2019s perception level is as- sessed by the alignment between its confidence and actual performance, with correctness of the answer serving as a proxy for performance. Therefore, the emphasis is on whether LVLMs can provide con- fidence that matches their performance. We focus on binary confidence because it directly helps us decide whether to trust the model.

    "with correctness of the answer serving as a proxy for performance. Therefore, the emphasis is on whether LVLMs can provide con- fidence that matches their performance. We focus on binary confidence because it directly helps us decide whether to trust the model. In this work, we explore this question by examin- ing three representative types of confidence signals that are widely used in LLMs: 1) Probabilistic confidence (Desai and Durrett, 2020; Guo et al., 2017a). The confidence is measured by the genera- tion probability of tokens in the output. 2) Answer consistency-based confidence (Zhang et al., 2024; Manakul et al., 2023b). Some studies argue that token-level probabilities poorly reflect a model\u2019s semantic confidence and are not suitable for black- box models. Instead, they suggest using semantic consistency across multiple responses as a confi- dence indicator. 3) Verbalized confidence (Lin et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2024b). The natural lan- guage confidence expressed by the model, offering an intuitive and model-agnostic signal without re- quiring repeated sampling. We conduct experiments using three represen- tative models\u2014-Qwen2.5-VL (Bai et al., 2025a), DeepSeek-VL2 (Wu et al., 2024), and LLaVA-v1.5 (Liu et al., 2024b)\u2014on three datasets: Dyn-VQA arXiv:2508.19111v1 [cs.CL] 26 Aug 2025 (Li et al., 2025b), MMMU Pro (Yue et al., 2024), and Visual7W (Zhu et al., 2016). The results show that LVLMs can perceive their knowledge bound- aries to some extent, but there is still considerable room for improvement. Among the three types of confidence, probabilistic and answer consistency- based confidences are more aligned with LVLMs\u2019 performance but rely on in-domain data for bina- rization, while verbalized confidence has weaker alignment and tends to be overconfident. To enhance LVLMs\u2019 perception capabilities, we adopt several representative confidence calibration methods originally designed for LLMs. The results show that methods that engage the model\u2019s rea- soning abilities can enhance both answer accuracy and verbalized perception level, whereas existing consistency-based methods have limited effective- ness and do not generalize well to LVLMs. We also propose three new approaches tailored for LVLMs: Img-CoT, Prob-Thr, and Cross Model, making fur- ther explorations into measuring their confidence. Compared to LLMs, LVLMs need to process an additional visual modality and integrate infor- mation across different modalities. This raises the question: How does the perception ability of LVLMs differ from that of LLMs? To investi- gate this, we compare the LVLMs with their cor- responding LLMs on the Dyn-VQA dataset (Li et al., 2025b; Tian et al., 2023). This dataset provides parallel visual-textual and pure textual queries, ensuring fair comparison between LLMs and LVLMs. We focus on verbalized confidence because it can reflect the model\u2019s language capabil- ities. Experimental results show that: 1) LVLMs exhibit lower VQA performance but higher per- ception accuracy",

This dataset provides parallel visual-textual and pure textual queries, ensuring fair comparison between LLMs and LVLMs. We focus on verbalized confidence because it can reflect the model\u2019s language capabil- ities. Experimental results show that: 1) LVLMs exhibit lower VQA performance but higher per- ception accuracy compared to their LLM counter- parts. 2) Certain prompting methods are ineffective for LVLMs, showing that LVLMs have weaker instruction-following capabilities. We hypothesize these phenomena may be caused by the following two reasons: 1) Compared to pro- cessing single-modality information, handling vi- sual inputs and integrating multiple modalities is more challenging for LVLMs. This results in lower VQA performance but also reduces the models\u2019 confidence, mitigating overconfidence and yield- ing a more accurate perception of their abilities. 2) Training LLMs without sufficient capacity to accommodate additional visual information can erode their language abilities, thereby weakening their instruction-following skills. Controlled ex- periments across different model scales and input modalities support these hypotheses. 2 Related Work LLM Knowledge Boundary Perception. Prior re- search has primarily focused on knowledge bound- ary perception in LLMs, with various methodolo- gies proposed to elicit confidence: verbalized con- fidence, where models directly articulate their con- fidence (Yang et al., 2024b; Yin et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023); consistency based confidence that derive confidence from answer consistency across multiple samples (Manakul et al., 2023a; Agrawal et al., 2024); probabilistic confidence, leveraging generated token likelihoods (Guo et al., 2017b; Ma et al., 2025; Ni et al., 2024b, 2025a); and internal state probing confidence, examining hidden states (Azaria and Mitchell, 2023; Ni et al., 2025b). Dif- ferently, our work investigates knowledge bound- ary perception in LVLMs and provides the first systematic comparison of these methods in the mul- timodal setting. LVLMs. Previous studies have established the widespread adoption of LVLMs in safety-critical domains such as healthcare (Li et al., 2023; Hu et al., 2024) and autonomous driving (Cui et al., 2024; Jiang et al., 2024). While these applications demonstrate LVLMs\u2019 functional capabilities, stud- ies show LVLMs frequently produce hallucinations (Bai et al., 2025b; Sahoo et al., 2024). The cur- rent body of work investigates this limitation on different aspects. Some work surveys hallucination types and their causes (Liu et al., 2024a; Zhou et al., 2024; Lan et al., 2024), while others focus on miti- gating hallucinations (Li et al., 2025a; Wang et al., 2024a; Xiao et al., 2025). A distinct but less ex- plored research thread investigates LVLMs\u2019 knowl- edge boundary as a potential framework for en- hancing model reliability (Chen et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2024b; Leng et al., 2024).

We take this line of work a step further by introducing a novel compar- ative paradigm that compares perception between LVLMs with their LLM counterparts. 3 Preliminaries In this section, we provide an overview of our task. 3.1 Task Formulation Visual Question Answering. The goal of visual question answering (VQA) can be described as follows. For a given question q and an image i, the model is asked to provide an answer a based on the question q and image i, that is, a = fmodel(q, i). LVLM Knowledge Boundary Perception. We as- sess the perception of LVLM\u2019s knowledge bound- ary with the alignment between confidence and its actual performance. Here, we use the model\u2019s vi- sual question answering correctness to serve as a proxy for performance and elicit different kinds of model confidence estimates. Confidence Estimation. In this paper, we con- duct experiments on the following three kinds of model confidence estimates. As widely adopted and training-free, they can be elicited without changing the internal knowledge of models. Probabilistic confidence is elicited through the aggregation of token probabilities for scoring, fol- lowed by applying a threshold to binarize the score into confidence. It is efficient but only captures lexical-level confidence and requires threshold tun- ing on a held-out set, which leads to poor gener- alizability. Some studies also argue that it is not applicable to black-box models (Kuhn et al., 2023). Answer consistency-based confidence is elicited by calculating the consistency of multiple gener- ated responses. The core idea is that if the model knows the correct answer, multiple sampled an- swers should be semantically consistent. It better captures semantics than probabilistic confidence, but is computationally expensive and still requires fitting a threshold (Manakul et al., 2023a). Verbalized confidence is elicited by directly ask- ing the model to express confidence (Yang et al., 2024b). Compared to the other two confidences, this confidence reflects models\u2019 self-awareness of their knowledge boundaries. Moreover, it elimi- nates the need for threshold fitting and multiple sampling. Therefore, this kind of confidence re- ceives our primary focus. 4 Knowledge Boundary Perception in LVLMs This section introduces experimental setup to eval- uate LVLMs\u2019 knowledge boundary perception abil- ity.

Detailed prompts are in Appendix A.1. Basic confidence estimates are in underline, and others are existing confidence calibration methods. 4.1.1 Vanilla Confidence Estimation Methods Probabilistic confidence is elicited through token probabilities. Here, we focus on the output perplex- ity of models. \u2022 Perplexity Threshold (PPL-Thr): Perplexity quantifies a model\u2019s uncertainty in content gener- ation (Cooper and Scholak, 2024). We binarize this metric into confidence by applying a thresh- old decided on a held-out set. Answer consistency-based confidence requires models to generate multiple responses, compute their consistency, and apply a threshold to the con- sistency scores for confidence elicitation. we im- plement a two-phase generation protocol: First, generating a reference answer with temperature = 0; Then sampling 10 variant answers with tempera- ture = 1.0, with semantic equivalence between the basic answer and sampled answers evaluated by Qwen2.5-0.5B. \u2022 Random Sample (Random): Simply sample re- sponses without modifying input. We evaluate two types of verbalized confidence: (1) Single-step verbalized confidence, which is gen- erated simultaneously with the answer, and (2) Double-step verbalized confidence, which is gener- ated by asking the model for an answer in the initial round of dialogue, then providing its confidence in the second round. The distinction between them lies in cognitive focus allocation: single-step confi- dence elicitation demands concurrent attention to both answer and confidence generation, whereas double-step confidence elicitation enables sequen- tial processing. \u2022 Single-step Vanilla (Vanilla) : Simply ask the model to generate both the answer and confi- dence in a single interaction. \u2022 Double-step Self Judging (Self-Jud): First, ac- quiring the model to provide an answer to the question, then asking it to generate confidence. 4.1.2 Calibrating Verbalized Confidence The three methods below aim to calibrate single- step verbalized confidence: \u2022 Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Zero-shot Chain-of- Thought prompting, Applying \u201cAnalyze step by step\u201d to the query (Kojima et al., 2023). \u2022 Punish: Penalizing overconfidence via the in- struction \u201cYou will be punished if the answer is not right but you say certain\u201d. \u2022 Explain: Requesting models to provide answer explanations before generating their confidence. The three methods below aim to calibrate double- step verbalized confidence: \u2022 Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Applying the Chain- of-Thought prompt in the confidence elicitation round of dialogue. \u2022 Challenge: We prepend the critical prompt \u201cI don\u2019t think your answer is right\u201d to the query in the confidence elicitation round in order to guide the model to be less overconfident. \u2022 Punish: Applying the Punish prompt in the con- fidence elicitation round of dialogue. 4.1.3 Calibrating",
    "of dialogue. \u2022 Challenge: We prepend the critical prompt \u201cI don\u2019t think your answer is right\u201d to the query in the confidence elicitation round in order to guide the model to be less overconfident. \u2022 Punish: Applying the Punish prompt in the con- fidence elicitation round of dialogue. 4.1.3 Calibrating Answer Consistency-Based Confidence \u2022 Rephrasing (Rephr): To address persistent errors caused by a specific question phrase, rephrase the original question into semantically equivalent variants with different phrases (Yang et al., 2024a). \u2022 Noised Image (Noised-Img): Reducing persis- tent errors caused by a specific image by creating semantically equivalent variants through the ad- dition of subtle noise to the original image. \u2022 Rephrasing and Noised Image (Reph+Nois): A combination of the Rephrasing and the Noised Image methods. 4.2 Newly Proposed Methods \u2022 Image Chain of Thought (Img-CoT): Prompt- ing models to generate textual image descrip- tions before reasoning to convert visual modality information to textual modality. \u2022 Probability Threshold (Prob-Thr): Prompting models to generate continuous probabilities of answers (0\u20131), then applies a threshold to them to generate binary confidences. The threshold is decided on a held-out set. \u2022 Cross Model: Utilizing generated responses from different models to calculate the consis- tency score. We generate answers using the three models mentioned in the next subsection. The primary model generates four responses, while the other two models each generate three re- sponses. We then calculate their consistency with the answer obtained through greedy sam- pling from the primary model to derive the con- fidence. This method can be viewed as using other models\u2019 answers to evaluate whether the answer generated by a given model is reliable. 4.3 Experimental Setup Datasets. We conduct experiments on three VQA benchmark datasets. They emphasize on LVLM\u2019s different abilities. Visual7W (Zhu et al., 2016) em- phasizes abilities in vision comprehension, it con- tains 70K image-QA pairs for basic visual under- standing.

Please refer to Appendix A.2 for implementation details and detailed results. 4.4.1 Performance of Different Types of Confidence Here, we analyze three basic elicited confidence\u2019s performance. Our findings are as follows: 1) Compared to verbalized and probabilis- tic confidence, answer consistency-based confi- dence often shows higher alignment. As shown in Table 1, the basic answer-consistency based con- fidence (Random) achieves higher alignment com- pared to verbalized (Vanilla, Self-Jud) and proba- bilistic confidences (PPL Thr) on both LLaVA-1.5 and Deepseek-VL2. This may be because, unlike probabilistic confidence that operates at the lexical level, answer consistency-based confidence better captures semantics by evaluating answer consis- tency (Kuhn et al., 2023), achieving higher align- ment. Additionally, while verbalized confidence is uncalibrated, eliciting answer consistency-based confidence calibrating a threshold on a held-out set, further improves alignment. Despite answer consistency-based confidence ex- hibiting high alignment, it comes at a cost: eliciting this kind of confidence requires generating multi- ple responses, incurring high computational costs. And its reliance on a held-out set for threshold cali- bration limits its generalizability. 2) Probabilistic confidence surpasses verbal- ized confidence in alignment performance. As shown in Table 1, probabilistic confidence\u2019s align- ment performance consistently surpasses verbal- ized confidence, and it outperforms answer consiste- ncy-based confidence on Qwen2.5-VL. Though it falls behind consistency-based confidence on LLAVA-1.5 and DeepSeek-VL2, the alignment dif- ferences are small. Additionally, it functions more efficiently without the high computational cost of generating multiple responses. However, probabilistic confidence, like answer consistency-based confidence, still requires thresh- old calibration on a held-out set, which affects its generalizability. 3) Verbalized confidence demonstrates lower alignment compared to probabilistic and answer consistency-based confidences, and judges an- swers overconfidently. Compared to probabilistic and answer consistency-based confidences, elicit- ing verbalized confidence is computationally ef- ficient and generalizable. However, as shown in Table 1, both single-step (Vanilla) and double-step (Self-Jud) verbalized confidences\u2019 alignment are Table 2: The performance of verbalized confidence on Qwen2.5-VL, single-step confidences are in blue and double-step confidences are in orange . method Dyn-VQA Visual7W MMMU Pro Conser.

To inves- tigate the cause of it, we calculate the conserva- tiveness and overconfidence on verbalized confi- dence, as shown in Table 2, we find that the ratio of overconfident responses is substantially higher than conservative responses. This pattern suggests that LVLMs, like LLMs, are intrinsically biased toward affirming their own output (Groot and Valdenegro- Toro, 2024; Sun et al., 2025). Table 2 also shows that double-step verbalized confidence exhibits more severe overconfidence than its single-step counterpart. This may be be- cause the model\u2019s self-generated answers in the first round of dialogue serve as false positive signals of its capability, reinforcing overconfident behavior through misleading the model to self-affirmation. 4.4.2 Confidence Calibration in LVLMs In this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of existing confidence calibration methods developed for LLMs in the context of LVLMs, as well as our proposed methods. For existing confidence calibration methods, our observations are as follows: 1) Single-step reasoning elicitation methods ef- fectively enhance the accuracy and alignment of LVLMs. As shown in Table 1, we found reasoning elicitation methods (Explain, CoT, and Img-CoT) exhibit high alignment. To further investigate them, we calculate other metrics about them. Table 3 shows that different reasoning elicitation methods excel on specific datasets: CoT method improves alignment and accuracy across all datasets and causes overconfidence on Dyn-VQA. The Explain method outperforms CoT in alignment on Visual7W and Dyn-VQA datasets. This observed difference may stem from the Explain method\u2019s design: while the CoT method enforces step-by-step reasoning, the Explain method prioritizes direct justification, thus reducing redundant context for simple ques- tions and improving the calibration of LVLMs\u2019 con- fidence outputs. 2) Answer consistency-based confidence cali- bration methods improve alignment on Qwen2.5- VL, but show limited effectiveness on other mod- els. We observed that, even when sampling re- sponses at the same temperature of 1.0, models differ in their output diversity. As shown in Ta- ble 1, when random sampling Qwen2.5-VL\u2019s re- sponses, it tends to generate consistent yet incorrect responses, resulting in low alignment. However, both the rephrasing and the noised image methods show effectiveness in mitigating this tendency, con- sequently achieving higher alignment. In contrast, LLaVA-1.5 and DeepSeek-VL2 generate more di- verse outputs when the response is incorrect, al- lowing the Random Sampling method to perform well and making Noised Image and Rephrasing methods less effective in enhancing alignment by comparison. We propose Image Chain of Thought, Probabil- ity Threshold, and Cross Model Consistency meth- ods in Section 4.1, their performances are as fol- lows: 1) Image",

We propose Image Chain of Thought, Probabil- ity Threshold, and Cross Model Consistency meth- ods in Section 4.1, their performances are as fol- lows: 1) Image Chain of Thought method effectively enhances alignment and accuracy on MMMU Pro. As shown in Table 3, Img-CoT demonstrates remarkable performance on the MMMU Pro dataset, which requires both strong visual perception and reasoning capabilities. It improves accuracy and alignment, outperforming CoT method. This in- dicates that its mechanism for converting visual modality into language modality can effectively enhance models\u2019 comprehension of the content in the image, thereby achieving superior performance. However, it fails to improve alignment on Dyn- VQA and Visual7W datasets, as their images lack complex objects like sheet music or circuit dia- grams which MMMU Pro contains. The forced \"describe the image\" process may lead to excessive descriptions, creating false positives in capability assessment and increasing overconfidence. You can refer to Appendix 4 for typical cases where Img-CoT makes the model overconfident, while the CoT method does not. 2) Probability Threshold method shows higher alignment than other double-step verbalizated confidence calibration methods. As shown in Table 1, the Probability Threshold method outper- forms alternative double-step methods. Despite the need to calibrate the threshold, it effectively enhances alignment.

Our results reveals that under random sampling conditions, Qwen2.5- VL shows weaker alignment between its consis- tency scores and actual capabilities across all three datasets compared to DeepSeek-VL2 and LLaVA- v1.5, which maintain stronger alignment. The Cross-Model approach addresses this limitation by incorporating responses from these better-aligned models, thereby improving the confidence calibra- tion and capability alignment for Qwen2.5-VL. 5 Perception Comparison Between LVLMs and LLMs Compared to LLMs, LVLMs need to process ad- ditional visual modality and integrate information across different modalities. This raises a question: how does the perception of LVLMs differ from that of LLMs? Knowing these distinctions is valuable for developing trustworthy LVLMs. In this section, we investigate the difference of knowledge boundary perception between LVLMs and their LLM counterparts. Focusing on ver- balized confidence cause it directly reflects mod- els\u2019 self-awareness of their knowledge boundaries. We further propose several hypotheses about these differences\u2019 underlying causes and validate them through the comparison between different model scales and input modalities. 5.1 Experimental Setup Datasets. In this section, we mainly focus on Dyn- VQA dataset. Dyn-VQA provides both VQA ques- tion image pairs and their semantically equivalent QA questions (e.g., QA: \u201cHow many humans have landed on Mars?\u201d vs. VQA: \u201cHow many humans have landed on this planet?\u201d with an image of Mars). This enables fair model performance com- parison across text-only modality and vision-text modality inputs. Models. In this section, we compare LVLMs with their base LLM counterparts to ensure fair compar- ison: Qwen2.5-VL, DeepSeek-VL2, LLaVA-v1.5 vs Qwen2.5, DeepSeek-MoE, Vicuna-v1.5. 5.2 Results and Analysis Here, we apply VQA queries on LVLMs, and their semantic equivalent QA queries on LLMs to fairly compare them. And focus on single-step verbalized confidence. We defer results about other kinds of confidence to Appendix A.3. Here are our findings: 1) Compared to LLMs, LVLMs struggle to follow certain methods\u2019 instructions, leading to performance deviating from expected. As shown in Table 4, Qwen2.5-VL cannot effectively follow the Punish instruction. As a result, this method not only fails to reduce overconfidence but actually exacerbates it, leading to lower alignment than Vanilla. Similarly, LLaVA-1.5 disregards CoT and Explain instructions, persistently generating responses without proper reasoning or explanation, Figure 2: Comparative",

As a result, this method not only fails to reduce overconfidence but actually exacerbates it, leading to lower alignment than Vanilla. Similarly, LLaVA-1.5 disregards CoT and Explain instructions, persistently generating responses without proper reasoning or explanation, Figure 2: Comparative analysis of instruction following ability across model scales. which results in lower accuracy. This stands in contrast to LLMs, where the Punish method effec- tively reduces Qwen2.5\u2019s overconfidence; CoT and Explain instructions reliably ignite reasoning re- sponses in Vicuna-1.5, thus improving its accuracy. 2) For single-step verbalized confidence, LVL- Ms tend to have lower accuracy compared to LLMs. Along with higher alignment due to re- duced overconfidence. As shown in Table 4, under all single-step verbalized confidence for the three series of models, the answer accuracy of LVLMs is lower than that of LLMs. Meanwhile, LVLMs exhibit a higher uncertain-rate compared to LLMs. Specifically, LLaVA exhibits an average accuracy reduction of 0.09 with a concurrent 0.382 increase in uncertain-rate than its counterpart LLM. And in DeepSeek-VL2, we observe a 0.089 accuracy decrement paired with a 0.615 surge in uncertainty than LLM. Compared to LLMs, LVLMs\u2019 accuracy drop is relatively smaller than their uncertain-rate increase, thus they demonstrate less severe over- confidence than LLMs, leading to relatively higher alignment in their responses. 5.3 Analysis Across Model Scales and Modalities Building upon the findings discussed in the previ- ous subsection, we observe notable performance distinctions between LLMs and LVLMs, which motivate us to propose the following hypothesis regarding their potential underlying causes: 1) Model capacity bottleneck: We hypothesize that the inferior instruction-following abilities of LVLMs stems from their internal capacity limita- tions, where visual modality integration competes for models\u2019 internal parameter resources that would otherwise support language processing capabilities. 2) Cross-modal limitation awareness: While the LVLMs demonstrate lower accuracy than LLMs, their verbalized confidence shows better alignment with performance. We hypothesize this stems from Table 5: The performance of LVLMs under different query modalities, we add text question at the bottom of the image to generate pure image \u201cV\u201dQA query.

To validate our capacity hypothesis of instruc- tion following ability, we conduct a comparative analysis on different scale models and find that: As LVLMs scale up, they generally exhibit stronger instruction following capabilities. As shown in Figure 2. For Qwen2.5-VL and DeepSeek- VL2, the Punish method effectively reduces over- confidence in larger models (Qwen2.5-VL-72B, DeepSeek-Vl2-16B) but shows limited impact on smaller ones ( < 32B Qwen2.5-VL, DeepSeek- VL2-3B). For LLaVA-1.5, the 13B model follows Explain instruction which 7B model not follows, thus Explain improves accuracy in the 13B model. These phenomena supports our hypothesis: the parameter constraints of small scale LVLMs create a dilemma between visual processing and linguis- tic comprehension, resulting in degraded language understanding and consequently weaker instruc- tion following ability. In contrast, larger LVLMs allocate more parameters to language processing, maintaining strong language ability while handling multimodal inputs, thus demonstrating stronger in- struction following ability. To validate our accuracy and alignment hypothe- sis, we conduct comparative analysis on text-only QA, vision-text VQA, and vision-only \"V\"QA mod- ality of queries on LVLMs, our results reveal that: S Ne} S Ny Overconfidence co \u00b0o Ww Nn S 8 Vanilla M8 Punish 3B 16B DeepSeek-VL2 -- Punish S nv So K S bo So Overconfidence N 8 Vanilla M8 Punish S an dl 3B 7B 32B = 72B Qwen2.5-VL -- Punish [mm Vanilla Mam Explain MS CoT 7B 13B LLaVA-v1.5 -- Explain & CoT LVLMs exhibit lower accuracy but higher alignment when responding to multimodal VQA queries. As shown in Table 5, both models demon- strate lower accuracy when answering VQA queries that demand cross-modal understanding ability com- pared to pure text QA and pure image \u201cV\u201dQA queries. Concurrently, they demonstrate increased uncertain-rate and improved confidence performan- ce alignment for these multimodal queries. These observations support our hypothesis: 1. Limited cross-modal ability: LVLMs struggle to effectively synthesize information across modal- ities, leading to reduced answering accuracy on multimodal queries compared to unimodal queries. 2. Capability awareness: When encountering challenging multimodal queries, LVLMs exhibit self-awareness of their limited ability through gen- erating more uncertainty responses. This decreases overconfidence and thus improves alignment. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of knowledge boundary perception in LVLMs, as- sessing this ability through alignment. First, we evaluate three kinds of confidence, and observe that answer consistency-based confidence reaches the highest alignment, whereas verbalized confidence induces overconfidence. We also evaluate several confidence calibration methods, with our results revealing that reasoning elicitation methods im- prove accuracy and alignment, while our proposed methods show effectiveness. Second, we compare LVLMs with LLMs, and reveal that while",

We also evaluate several confidence calibration methods, with our results revealing that reasoning elicitation methods im- prove accuracy and alignment, while our proposed methods show effectiveness. Second, we compare LVLMs with LLMs, and reveal that while LVLMs exhibit lower QA accuracy, they achieve higher alignment, which is attributable to LVLMs\u2019 aware- ness of their multimodal integration ability limita- tion. We also observe that LVLMs have weaker instruction following ability than LLMs. Limitations First, due to dataset constraints, we only compared LVLMs and LLMs on Dyn-VQA; broader bench- marks are needed for future validation. Second, our analysis did not examine internal model states, leaving internal mechanistic differences in knowl- edge boundary perception underexplored. Third, we focused on binary confidence measures; extend- ing this to continuous confidence scales could yield finer-grained insights. These limitations highlight directions for future work on LVLM evaluation and interpretability. Ethics Statement In this paper, all the datasets we use are open- source, and the models we employ are either open- source or widely used.

Question: [The original question] Semantically equivalent questions: A.2 LVLMs\u2019 Knowledge Boundary Perception Ability A.2.1 Implementation Details In this section, we provide a detailed introduction to our implementation details. For content generation, we mainly utilize APIs to generate answers. For verbalization based methods, we set the model temperature to 0 and set a fixed seed to obtain high- quality and relatively consistent responses. No- tably, Probability Threshold method is exclusively employed in a double round form because we find some of the models struggle to generate both con- tinuous probabilities and answers in a single round. For the consistency based methods, we imple- mente a two-phase generation protocol: First, gen- erating a reference answer with temperature = 0; Then sampling 10 variant answers with tempera- ture = 1.0, with semantic equivalence between the basic answer and sampled answers evaluated by Qwen2.5-0.5B. With this process, we can get a consistency score between 0 to 10. Specifically, for question rephrasing method, we leveraged Qwen2.5-7B to produce semantically equivalent question paraphrases. For the noised image method, we progressively added zero-mean Gaussian noise to the images during sampling, with the standard deviation incrementally increased from 0 in steps of 0.05. And for the cross model con- sistency method, we computed consistency scores using a combination of four responses generated by the primary model and three responses each from two other reference models. A.2.2 Complete Results Table 6, Table 7 and Table 8 present the comprehen- sive performance evaluation of all methods across the three benchmark datasets and three LVLMs employed in our study. A.2.3 Observations and Analysis We proposed our mainly findings about LVLMs\u2019 knowledge boundary perception methods in Sec- tion 4.4. Here, we discuss more detailed observa- tions about them. 1) The Explain method improves alignment for both Deepseek-VL2 and Qwen2.5 when tested on the Dyn-VQA and Visual7W datasets. This demon- strates its effectiveness in enhancing LVLMs\u2019 knowl- edge boundary perception when processing rela- tively simple input questions. 2) The single-step Chain",
    "we discuss more detailed observa- tions about them. 1) The Explain method improves alignment for both Deepseek-VL2 and Qwen2.5 when tested on the Dyn-VQA and Visual7W datasets. This demon- strates its effectiveness in enhancing LVLMs\u2019 knowl- edge boundary perception when processing rela- tively simple input questions. 2) The single-step Chain of Thought method effectively enhances alignment, whereas its double- step counterpart often leads to overconfidence and only marginally improves alignment for Qwen2.5- VL. 3) Both single-step and double-step Punish meth- ods demonstrate limited effectiveness in mitigating overconfidence for Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA-v1.5, as they fail to properly follow Punish Instructions. 4) Challenge method induces very high uncertain- rate in both three models, indicating that LVLMs are easily swayed by the output judgements. 5) For Qwen2.5-VL, rephrasing methods im- prove alignment on the Dyn-VQA dataset (language- focused), while the noise image method enhances performance on Visual7W (vision-focused). The combination of these two methods boosts align- ment on the MMMU Pro dataset, which requires both language and vision comprehension. This reveals an interesting relationship between pertur- bation modalities and input query types. A.3 Comparing Perception between LVLMs and LLMs While the main body presents a comparative anal- ysis of single-step verbalization based confidence elicitation methods between LLMs and LVLMs, this section provides an extensive evaluation of: (i) double step verbalization based methods, (ii) an- swer consistency based methods, and (iii) token probability based method. The results can be found in Table 9. The main observations are as follows. A.3.1 Double Step Verbalization Based Methods For double step verbalization based methods, the difference in performance between LLM and LVLM varies with the method. 1) For the Self-Judging method, Qwen2.5 ex- hibits higher alignment than Qwen2.5-VL. In con- trast, the LLM counterparts of DeepSeek-VL2 and LLaVA tend to respond with \u201ccertain\u201d to nearly all answers, resulting in extremely low consistency. This indicates a severe bias toward overconfident responses in these two LLMs. 2) For the Challenge method, LVLMs demon- strate higher uncertain-rates than LLMs, often ap- proaching to near 1.0. This suggests that LVLMs are more likely to trust external judgments and con- sequently undermine their own decisions. 3) Under the Double-step Punish method, LLMs outperform LVLMs due to their stronger instruction following ability, achieving higher consistency and lower overconfidence. A.3.2 Answer Consistency Based Methods For answer consistency based methods, our obser- vations are as follows: 1) Answer consistency based methods demon- strate superior alignment performance in LVLMs compared to LLMs. 2) DeepSeek-MoE exhibits strong consistency in its generated answers, maintaining high answer uni- formity even when the outputs are incorrect. This behavior persists across both random sampling and rephrasing methods, leading to sustained overcon- fidence and suboptimal alignment performance. 3) The rephrasing strategy shows",
    "performance in LVLMs compared to LLMs. 2) DeepSeek-MoE exhibits strong consistency in its generated answers, maintaining high answer uni- formity even when the outputs are incorrect. This behavior persists across both random sampling and rephrasing methods, leading to sustained overcon- fidence and suboptimal alignment performance. 3) The rephrasing strategy shows limited effec- tiveness in improving alignment metrics across all evaluated models, with the notable exception of Qwen2.5-VL. This observation holds true for both LVLMs and LLMs in our results. A.3.3 Token Probability Based Methods For the token probability based approach, as shown in Table 9, our results reveal that LLMs exhibit relatively weaker confidence-accuracy alignment compared to LVLMs. A.4 Case Study of LVLM Outputs A.4.1 CoT vs Img-CoT As shown in Figure 3, In this case, the model gen- erates extensive image descriptions under the Img- CoT method and confidently confirms its answer while the answer is wrong, demonstrating overcon- fidence. A.5 Small Scale LVLMs vs Large Scale LVLMs As illustrated in Figure 4, we observe a notable dif- ference in instruction following behavior between LLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaVA-v1.5-14B. While the 7B model fails to adhere to the Explain instruc- tion, the 14B variant successfully generates both explanatory sentences and the correct answer. Similarly, Figure 5 highlights a contrast in in- struction following performance between Qwen2.5- 7B and Qwen2.5-72B. The smaller 7B model ex- hibits overconfidence, incorrectly judging the an- swer without following the Punish instruction, whereas the 72B model responds more conservatively, align- ing with the given directive.

The description of the image is in underline Figure 4: Different scale LLaVA-v1.5\u2019s performance under the Explain instruction, The explanation of the answer is in blue. Image: Question: How many flights has this system launched? Qwen2.5-VL-7B's CoT response: The image shows a rocket on a launch pad, which appears to be the Saturn V rocket used for NASA's Apollo missions. The Saturn V was used for six manned spaceflights as part of the Apollo program. Uncertain Qwen2.5-VL-7B's Img-CoT response: The image shows a rocket on a launch pad, illuminated by bright lights, likely during a nighttime launch. The rocket appears to be part of the Saturn V family, which was used for NASA's Apollo missions and Skylab program. Step 1: Identify the rocket system. - The rocket in the image is consistent with the Saturn V, which was a powerful American expendable launch system used by NASA. Step 2: Determine the number of flights. - The Saturn V launched six times: - Apollo 4 (uncrewed test flight) - Apollo 6 (uncrewed test flight) - Apollo 7 - Apollo 8 - Apollo 11 - Apollo 13 Therefore, the Saturn V system has launched six flights.",

Question: The 1939 German invasion of this country began soon after Germany signed a non-aggression pact with what other nation? LLaVA-v1.5-7B response: Poland. Certain LLaVA-v1.5-13B response: The 1939 German invasion of Poland began soon after Germany signed a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. This pact, known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, was signed on August 23, 1939, and it allowed Germany and the Soviet Union to divide Poland between them. The invasion of Poland began on September 1, 1939, and it marked the beginning of World War II.

    "Beyond the Black Box: Integrating Lexical and Semantic Methods in Quantitative Discourse Analysis with BERTopic Thomas Compton University of York thomas.compton@york.ac.uk August 27, 2025 Abstract Quantitative Discourse Analysis (QDA) has seen growing adoption with the rise of Large Lan- guage Models (LLMs) and computational tools. However, reliance on \u2019black box\u2019 software such as MAXQDA and NVivo risks undermining methodological transparency and alignment with research goals. This paper presents a hybrid, transparent framework for QDA that combines lexical (bag-of- words, n-grams) and semantic (sentence embeddings, BERTopic) methods to enable triangulation, reproducibility, and interpretability. Drawing from a case study in historical political discourse, we demonstrate how custom Python pipelines using NLTK, spaCy, and Sentence Transformers allow fine- grained control over preprocessing, lemmatisation, and embedding generation. We further detail our iterative BERTopic modelling process\u2014incorporating UMAP dimensionality reduction, HDBSCAN clustering, and c-TF-IDF keyword extraction\u2014optimised through parameter tuning and multiple runs to enhance topic coherence and coverage. By juxtaposing precise lexical searches with context- aware semantic clustering, we argue for a multi-layered approach that mitigates the limitations of either method in isolation. Our workflow underscores the importance of code-level transparency, researcher agency, and methodological triangulation in computational discourse studies.

As computational tools become increasingly accessible, researchers are turning to Large Language Models (LLMs) and automated text analysis platforms to process large-scale historical and social datasets (Kim et al., 2025; Murugaraj, Lamsiyah and Schommer, 2025). While these tools offer efficiency, treating them as \u2019black boxes\u2019 risks misalignment between research goals and model capabilities (Cigliano, Fallucchi and Gerardi, 2024; Benz et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2024). This paper presents a transparent, reproducible framework for QDA that integrates lexical and semantic methods to support interpretative rigour. We argue that combining bag-of-words (BOW) frequency analysis with sentence embedding-based topic modelling (via BERTopic) enables methodological triangulation. This hybrid approach ensures both precision in term detection and sensitivity to contextual meaning. Our implementation leverages Python, NLTK, spaCy, and Sentence Transformers, allowing full control over preprocessing and model fine-tuning. We evaluate multiple embedding models and report coherence, coverage, and structural metrics to justify our final model choice. Code and data are available at https://github.com/UnbrokenCocoon/BERTopic_Stability/. 2 Background and Related Work The integration of computational methods into discourse analysis has accelerated with the public avail- ability of LLMs. These models assist in OCR transcription (Kim et al., 2025), summarization (Muru- garaj, Lamsiyah and Schommer, 2025), and unsupervised pattern detection.

However, scholars caution against uncritical use of commercial software such as MAXQDA and NVivo, which often obscure pre- processing steps and clustering logic (Cigliano, Fallucchi and Gerardi, 2024; Benz et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2024). 1 arXiv:2508.19099v1 [cs.CL] 26 Aug 2025 Topic modeling has evolved from Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei, Ng and Jordan, 2003) to context-aware models like BERTopic (Grootendorst, 2022), which uses sentence embeddings and clus- tering. BERTopic outperforms LDA in capturing semantic nuance, especially in short or heterogeneous texts (Benz et al., 2025; Nanyonga et al., 2025). However, its stochastic nature and parameter sensitivity require careful optimisation (Kumar, Karamchandani and Singh, 2024). Our work builds on calls for transparency (Al-Zaman and Rashid, 2025) and multi-layered analysis (Zeng, 2024), advocating for researcher-led pipelines that balance automation with interpretative control. 3 Challenges in Quantitative Discourse Analysis Three key challenges hinder robust QDA: complexity, accuracy, and transparency. Complexity creates barriers for non-technical researchers. While \u2019plug-and-play\u2019 tools lower entry thresholds, they often prevent fine-tuning, leading to suboptimal alignment between research questions and model outputs (Cigliano, Fallucchi and Gerardi, 2024). In contrast, coding-based approaches (e.g., Python) enable customization but require technical literacy. Accuracy varies across methods. Lexical approaches like BOW count exact term matches (e.g., \u201ccommunity\u201d), enabling precise frequency counts. However, they ignore morphology (e.g., \u201ccommuni- ties\u201d) and context. Lemmatisation\u2014implemented via spaCy\u2014resolves this by reducing words to root forms (Bagheri, Entezarian and Sharifi, 2023). Yet, commercial tools like MAXQDA and NVivo often lack such features, producing inconsistent frequencies. Transparency is compromised when models operate as black boxes. Without access to preprocessing or clustering logic, researchers cannot assess reliability. Custom code, referencing NLTK and SpaCy documentation, allows full auditability and reproducibility. 4 Methodological Framework We adopt a hybrid framework combining: \u2022 Lexical methods: BOW and n-grams for precise term frequency and collocation analysis. \u2022 Semantic methods: Sentence embeddings and BERTopic for context-aware clustering. This dual approach enables triangulation: lexical results ground findings in observable counts, while semantic outputs reveal framing and discourse structure. 4.1 Lexical Analysis We generate: \u2022 Bag-of-Words (BOW): Frequency-normalized term counts. \u2022 n-grams: Bigrams and trigrams to contextualize key terms (e.g., \u201cpublic campaign\u201d, \u201ccommunity action\u201d). These are used deductively (searching for predefined terms) and inductively (identifying top frequent items). Table 1: Top 5 Bigrams Containing \u2019Education\u2019 Bigram Count (\u201ctechnical\u201d, \u201ceducation\u201d) 23 (\u201csecondary\u201d, \u201ceducation\u201d) 19 (\u201cboard\u201d, \u201ceducation\u201d) 16 (\u201ceducation\u201d, \u201ccommittee\u201d) 13 (\u201ceducation\u201d, \u201cauthority\u201d) 12 The bigrams table suggests that the union was concerned with the education of young people, with particular interest in the \u2018technical\u2019 (23) education of apprentices.",

A frequency of 23 places \u2018technical\u2019 and \u2018education\u2019 in the 99.62th percentile, making them comparatively high. 2 In this approach, I focus on percentiles as a representation of frequency within the text, as bigram frequency in isolation does not provide analytic value. Another approach could use percentages, but percentiles are useful in indicating frequency within a Zipfian distribution, as the majority of terms within all bigrams are liable to be low frequency. However, inferences should be drawn from a combination of approaches, where bigrams and their frequencies assist in understanding important ideas based on their frequency. To supplement this, using the total lemmas (through spaCy) can provide a more general view of a term\u2019s usage. For example, lemmas containing \u2018apprentice\u2019 total 147 (95.82th percentile). It will be for the discretion of the user to determine what threshold determines the significance of a term\u2019s usage, but beyond the 90th or 95th percentile may be useful lines in the sand. 4.2 Semantic Analysis We use sentence embeddings to represent text contextually. Sentences are embedded using pre-trained models, then clustered via BERTopic to detect latent themes. 5 Implementation: BERTopic Pipeline Our BERTopic workflow (Table 2) includes manual and automated steps: Table 2: BERTopic Processing Pipeline Step Process Type Description Pre-processing Manual Split corpus into sentences of even length Embedding Manual Use all-mpnet-base-v2 to generate 768D vectors Dimensionality Reduction Internal Apply UMAP to reduce to 2D Clustering Internal HDBSCAN groups similar sentences Keyword Extraction Internal c-TF-IDF retrieves top 10 terms per topic Topic Refinement Manual Merge, rename, select 15 final topics Output Manual Save, visualize, evaluate We selected all-mpnet-base-v2 after evaluating five embedding models (Table 4). This model balances coherence, topic distribution, and runtime. 6 Model Evaluation and Selection Table 3: Corpus Statistics: Sentence Length Distribution Corpus Total Sentences Avg Length Min Length Max Length \u00a15 Words \u00bf25 Words B&S 95,557 15.22 5 270 0 4,763 To select the optimal embedding model, we ran BERTopic on five precomputed embeddings and compared outcomes across six metrics.

Whereas all-mpnet-base-v2 is a popular embedding model because of its higher accuracy. Many may choose the former over the latter for speed; however, the results show the latter had a marginally faster BERTopic speed. This is calculated using pre-computed embeddings, so it does not reflect the time taken to pre-compute the embeddings. distilroberta-base was found less frequently within the literature, but performed well in terms of outliers, topics, and Gini Score, demonstrating a good distribution of topics produced. This may suggest this model is being overlooked. Whereas bge-small-en-v1.5 is a baseline of BGE, with mpnet-distilled trained using BGE\u2019s sentence similarity scores. This suggests that BGE performs well at similarity tasks but is not as appropriate for BERTopic. While mpnet-distilled achieved the highest coherence (0.26), it produced fewer topics and neg- ative silhouette, indicating cluster overlap. bge-small-en-v1.5 showed high Gini (0.867), suggesting dominance by a few large topics, and poor cluster separation. all-mpnet-base-v2 offered a balanced trade-off: moderate coherence (0.09), high topic count (584), and neutral silhouette\u2014making it ideal for exploratory discourse analysis. 7 Discussion Our hybrid approach demonstrates that lexical and semantic methods are not competing but comple- mentary. BOW analysis provides auditable, reproducible counts (e.g., frequency of \u201ccommunity\u201d), while BERTopic reveals how the term is framed\u2014e.g., in relation to solidarity, activism, or governance. The stochastic nature of BERTopic necessitates multiple runs and parameter tuning (Kumar, Karam- chandani and Singh, 2024). We mitigated this by testing configurations and selecting the most coherent, well-distributed output. Manual topic refinement ensured interpretability, aligning with qualitative dis- course goals. Crucially, custom coding in Python enabled transparency and fine-tuning\u2014unavailable in MAXQDA/NVivo. However, this demands technical investment. We advocate for interdisciplinary training to bridge this gap. 8 Conclusion and Future Work We presented a transparent, triangulated framework for QDA using lexical and semantic methods.

The argument is to focus on triangulation with NLP approaches, focusing on working in concert with qualitative insights and quantitative metrics. This recognises that each approach has advantages and limitations. Therefore, models can be used not to replace qualitative approaches but to complement them.

    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Natural Language Art Provenance Searches in the Getty Provenance Index Mathew Henrickson - University of Leeds - School of Computing (AI for Language) Abstract This research presents a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for art provenance studies, focusing on the Getty Provenance Index. Provenance Research establishes the ownership history of artworks, which is essential for verifying authenticity, supporting restitution and legal claims, and understanding the cultural and historical context of art objects. The process is complicated by fragmented, multilingual archival data that hinders efficient retrieval. Current search portals require precise metadata, limiting exploratory searches. Our method enables natural-language and multilingual searches through semantic retrieval and contextual summarization, reducing dependence on metadata structures. We assess RAG's capability to retrieve and summarize auction records using a 10,000-record sample from the Getty Provenance Index \u2013 German Sales. The results show this approach provides a scalable solution for navigating art market archives, offering a practical tool for historians and cultural heritage professionals conducting historically sensitive research. Introduction The provenance of an artwork is the \u2018ownership history of a work of art\u2019 (Gerstenblith, 2019), and in recent years, many new digital resources have been offered for conducting Provenance Research. One of the leading tools is the Getty Provenance Index (GPI), which is noted as overcoming significant challenges in the availability of digital data to researchers (Sallabedra, 2024). Provenance Research is essential for understanding the historical context of cultural objects, particularly those affected by Nazi looting (Fuhrmeister & Hopp, 2019). This research is still a time-intensive discipline, hindered by dispersed archival sources and limited funding. Fuhrmeister and Hopp (2019) noted that one museum estimated that it would take 274 years to catalogue just 7,000 paintings, underscoring the scale of the challenge. The problem we sought to address is how the latest search technology can make information retrieval from such resources more efficient and accessible for researchers to improve upon the current standards of online search portals. The Getty Provenance Index and the Role of RAG in Modern Provenance Research The Getty Provenance Index (GPI) is one of the most widely used digitised provenance datasets available to researchers. It provides access to over 1 million records from auction catalogues, dealer stock books, and archival inventories, many of which are otherwise inaccessible or dispersed across European institutions. As Schuhmacher (2024) notes, the GPI has become a cornerstone for Provenance Research, particularly in the context of Nazi-era art sales and restitution efforts. Fuhrmeister and Hopp (2019) argue that Provenance Research must now contend with vast, multilingual, and fragmented data ecosystems, and that scalable, interdisciplinary tools are essential to meet the demands of restitution, transparency, and historical accountability.

    "art sales and restitution efforts. Fuhrmeister and Hopp (2019) argue that Provenance Research must now contend with vast, multilingual, and fragmented data ecosystems, and that scalable, interdisciplinary tools are essential to meet the demands of restitution, transparency, and historical accountability. By combining semantic retrieval with generative summarisation, RAG enables researchers to query large corpora using natural language searches to reveal relevant records and generate explainable summaries grounded in a given context. This is particularly valuable when metadata is incomplete or inconsistently structured, as RAG can infer relevance from embedded semantic cues rather than relying on rigid keyword matching. As Provenance Research increasingly shifts toward scalable and explainable RAG is a conceptually aligned and technically practical approach. Conceptual Problem Statement We proposed a framework that uses text encoding, specifically RAG, to search digitised art provenance archives. RAG retrieves semantically relevant data from a source document corpus and passes it to a Large Language Model (LLM), which processes the information and returns a user-friendly summary (Lewis et al., 2020). This prototype is designed to enable more flexible and efficient retrieval of provenance information from the GPI, with the goal of accelerating and enhancing Provenance Research. Researchers face the central issue of tracing specific object histories and having to search databases that only handle targeted queries. Targeted queries are defined as those where prior knowledge of specific metadata is required to optimally retrieve information. A technique that can handle broader, exploratory, and more thematic queries could significantly improve this. We addressed this issue using a RAG solution to retrieve information in a semantically flexible manner to enhance object searches. To summarise, our objectives for the RAG prototype are the following: \uf095 Enable flexible, natural-language queries, such as \u2018find me paintings records of paintings by [artist name] that contain motifs of family and social activities,\u2019 without requiring precise metadata knowledge. \uf095 Support multilingual semantic search, enabling non-German language queries to retrieve relevant content from German-language archives. This applies to many major languages when interacting with the search tool. \uf095 Incorporate semantic-aware retrieval, where the given search terms are automatically expanded to include related or synonymous concepts\u2014e.g., a query for Portr\u00e4t also retrieves results featuring Mannerbildnis (male portrait) or Bildnis (German language for portrait). Related Work Recent studies have increasingly explored the intersection of AI and cultural heritage and highlighted an increasing focus on the integration of such tools into the Humanities. G\u00eerbacia (2024) showed key trends in the application of AI across heritage domains, emphasising the role of semantic technologies. Shinde et al.

(2024) provided a systematic review of AI in archival science, highlighting parallels with Provenance Research in data structuring and retrieval. Bushey (2024) investigated visual AI in archival contexts, suggesting opportunities for multimodal extensions of text-based systems. Zou and Lin (2024) presented case studies on AI in conservation, underscoring the value of interdisciplinary approaches. Together, these studies underline the relevance of integrating AI-based techniques into information retrieval in the Humanities and point toward future enhancements such as multilingual support and hybrid retrieval strategies. This study addressed a gap in the current literature, namely, the application of semantic retrieval for Provenance Research and art historical research. This study builds on developments made by the Getty Research Institute in providing large-scale art market datasets for Provenance Research (Frederiksen, 1999), with a particular focus on Nazi-era provenance. In 2011, the Getty, in collaboration with the University of Heidelberg and the Berlin Art Library, digitised over 3,200 auction catalogues. Schumacher highlights the value of the Getty Provenance Index (GPI), describing it as 'short-circuiting searches that could otherwise take years.' Meike Hopp (2023) characterises Provenance Research as a Daueraufgabe\u2014a permanent task\u2014and calls for greater infrastructure and interdisciplinary collaboration. Although digitisation has improved access, the application of RAG techniques, introduced by Lewis et al. (2020) in art market and art historical research, is limited. RAG based techniques are becoming an increasingly significant role in industry and academia for smarter information retrieval (Hongliu et al. 2024), yet there is a gap in the application of such techniques in art historical domains, where there is a need for effective and flexible information search frameworks. This study builds on these technologies to propose a prototype framework for AI- assisted Provenance Research, addressing a critical gap in the interdisciplinary application of RAG to cultural heritage data, specifically Provenance Research. Study Aims and Structure The aim of our study was to evaluate the viability of RAG for information retrieval in Provenance Research. We tested a RAG framework using high-performing propriety models from OpenAI (Caspari et al. 2024) and used a combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics to evaluate both the retrieval and end outputs compared with the original input search question. The following framework is intended as a complementary tool to the established search portals available to researchers. Its aim is to fulfil the role of a multilingual information retrieval assistant capable of searching for semantically similar matches across auction catalogue text. By doing so we show the potential of RAG to make searches more flexible and efficient, while broadening the potential research audience by introducing multi-lingual semantic searches for the first time",
    "the role of a multilingual information retrieval assistant capable of searching for semantically similar matches across auction catalogue text. By doing so we show the potential of RAG to make searches more flexible and efficient, while broadening the potential research audience by introducing multi-lingual semantic searches for the first time to the GPI dataset. Many combinations of text embedding models and text summarisation models are available, but we limited the scope of our study to evaluating RAG as a technique using established propriety models. B A prototype pipeline using text vectorisation (OpenAI text-embedding-3-large), vector storage (FAISS), and GPT4o (OpenAI) for retrieval summarisation is outlined along with its practical evaluation for the discipline. We chose OpenAI text-embedding-3-large for our text encoding owing to its robust performance in granular semantic retrieval and text embedding benchmarks (Harris et al., 2024). FAISS was selected as the vector index owing to its extensive use in academic and commercial retrieval systems (Douze et al. \u2013 Meta. 2024), its support for high- dimensional and large-scale vector searches, and its flexibility in indexing strategies (e.g. flat, IVF, and HNSW). FAISS enables efficient similarity search across millions of vectors (Douze et al., 2019), making it well-suited for evaluating retrieval performance in domain-specific corpora, such as historical auction catalogues. To evaluate the RAG framework, we selected a 10 K- record sample from the GPI. This size provides sufficient scale to test retrieval performance while maintaining practical efficiency for iterative experimentation. The full GPI contains approximately 830 K records; our sample was drawn using random selection to preserve representativeness across the dataset. When preparing auction records for processing, our priority was to keep the end-to-end model as simple and transparent as possible for non-technical users. This informed our decision to avoid metadata filtering. While metadata filters can be useful in technical contexts, they introduce an additional layer of logic that would need to be explained and justified to users unfamiliar with data engineering. Our aim was to offer a tool the only requirement is to input a natural language query. Removing metadata logic helps avoid unnecessary complexity and keeps the interface conceptually clean. To retain the richness of metadata without introducing technical barriers, we opted for text augmentation by embedding key metadata fields directly into the auction record text. By integrating metadata into the textual content, we preserved important information, such as sale date, auction house, or catalogue number, while maintaining a single, unified input stream for the model. This means that users can still retrieve metadata-relevant results simply by phrasing their query naturally without needing to know which fields exist or how to structure a filter. This design choice supported our broader aim: to offer a conceptually simple tool that",

This means that users can still retrieve metadata-relevant results simply by phrasing their query naturally without needing to know which fields exist or how to structure a filter. This design choice supported our broader aim: to offer a conceptually simple tool that enables historians and other non-technical users to explore the dataset using natural language alone while still using the full informational depth of the records. The prototype architecture is outlined as follows: For ease of reference, some of the pipeline stages are aggregated. Fig 1. - an overview of the RAG workflow ant Records + Task ant Fo Prompt Gao et al. (2024) outlined the distinct types of RAG techniques currently available. The technique presented in this study can be classified as a Naive RAG implementation, enhanced with select Advanced RAG features\u2014notably semantic text augmentation and structured prompt design\u2014to improve usability and retrieval quality in the context of Provenance Research. However, the addition of further features is intentionally limited to favour ease of conceptual understanding by end users. The study, owing to its interdisciplinary end-user audience and application, targets a simpler implementation than some of the latest architectures (see Self-RAG Akari et al., 2024, Adaptive RAG, Soyeong et al., 2024). This is a key consideration because potential future users of the search capability must be able to conceptually understand the mechanics of the pipeline. AI solutions can be powerful but suffer from a \u2018black box\u2019 effect where end users can tend to be sceptical of end results of how they work. Explainability, interpretability, and understandability (Tang et al., 2019) are, therefore, paramount when adapting such technologies for a discipline where trust and reliability play a vital role. Methodology Our RAG pipeline aligns most closely with the Naive RAG paradigm as defined by Gao et al. (2024), with select enhancements -such as semantic text augmentation and structured prompt design - that support usability and interpretability needed in Provenance Research. The stages of our RAG prototype from data preparation and encoding to final retrieval are described in detail below. \uf095 Text Augmentation for Semantic Retrieval. Raw auction catalogue entries were enriched with key metadata fields (artist, object type, auction house, material, dimensions, title or description, auction date URL link to the original scanned catalogue). This enriched format ensured that all relevant information is embedded into the text, simplifying retrieval and avoiding the need for hybrid search methods. To further justify the choice of text enrichment vs. metadata filtering, we noted that there are some significant inconsistencies and spelling variations in the metadata, where simple filtering based on lexical matching may fail and miss relevant records. This approach also removed some of the technical",

To further justify the choice of text enrichment vs. metadata filtering, we noted that there are some significant inconsistencies and spelling variations in the metadata, where simple filtering based on lexical matching may fail and miss relevant records. This approach also removed some of the technical complexities of hybrid searches and metadata filtering (Sawarkar et al. 2025). An example of augmented text from the available data is included below: Auction House: Fischer Sale Date: 1939-06-30 00:00:00 Artist: Dix, Otto Title: Mutter und Kind.

The model generates 3072-dimensional embeddings that capture nuanced semantic meanings. \uf095 Vector Indexing with FAISS: The generated embeddings were L2-normalized and stored in a FAISS index using IndexFlatIP, enabling cosine similarity search via inner product. \uf095 Query Embedding and Retrieval: Test queries were embedded using the same model and compared against the FAISS index. The most semantically similar documents are retrieved using inner product similarity via FAISS IndexFlatIP. Because all embeddings were L2- normalized, inner product is equivalent to cosine similarity (Singh & Singh, 2020). \uf095 Prompt Construction: Retrieved documents were formatted into a structured prompt using a custom builder function. The prompt included a system message that defined the LLM\u2019s role and provided clear instructions for summarising the retrieved content. The prompt construction included the raw context retrieved from the FAISS vector index and the original query for further reference. \uf095 Generative Response: The prompt was passed to GPT-4 (gpt-4o), which generated a concise, context-aware response. The instruction included in the prompt requested a further refinement of the information retrieval and reranked the records based on their relevance to the retrieval prompt. This was designed to maximise the reliability of the final information retrieved by the user. The final output was also defined in the prompt to include all relevant metadata references and URL references to the primary source materials. This strategy directly addresses the concerns raised by Fuhrmeister and Hopp (2019) regarding the integration of technology into Provenance Research. In the following section we outline the evaluation method for assessing both the quality of the semantic context retrieval and the final generative LLM output received by the end-user.

    "integration of technology into Provenance Research. In the following section we outline the evaluation method for assessing both the quality of the semantic context retrieval and the final generative LLM output received by the end-user. Evaluation This evaluation covers two aspects: (1) a comparison of the RAG pipeline with the current user experience of searches using the Getty Research Portal, and (2) a detailed evaluation of RAG retrieval and output using a sample of 20 diverse search queries. As Yu et al. (2024) note, evaluating RAG pipelines is inherently complex owing to their domain-specific nature. No single standard framework is universally applicable, and this challenge was clear in our study. Consequently, we developed a tailored evaluation framework that focused on the semantic relevance of the retrieved contexts. Specifically, we analysed the top k retrievals \u2014 the 10 most semantically similar results to each query \u2014 to assess how well the system supports Provenance Research, which often targets one or a few specific object Traditional metrics such as precision, recall, or accuracy are not always suitable for Provenance Research, which often targets one or a few specific objects. Where possible, retrieved contexts were compared against a known ground truth set. However, provenance queries are frequently thematic or imprecise\u2014for example, searching for motifs in paintings described variably across auction records. In such cases, manual dataset searches were conducted, though the completeness of the ground truth could not be guaranteed. Notably, the model occasionally retrieved more relevant records than manual efforts, highlighting the need for a flexible evaluation framework. To capture the \u2018accuracy\u2019 of the information retrieval, while keeping consistent metrics across our evaluation, we chose the following metrics. \uf095 Completeness: The percentage of known or expected records appearing in the top k retrievals and final summarised output. \uf095 Manual Evaluation: A qualitative score (1\u20133) assessing the relevance of the final output to the query: \u2022 1: Irrelevant \u2022 2: Partially relevant \u2022 3: Highly relevant These metrics were chosen to accommodate the variability and thematic nature of provenance queries, where conventional evaluation methods may fall short. In several cases, the model retrieved more relevant records than manual efforts, underscoring the need for a flexible evaluation framework: We tested 20 search queries in total, spanning a range of complexity\u2014from straightforward object lookups to semantically vague searches to find object records in the GPI sample data. We categorised the queries into four distinct types. \uf095 Specific \u2013 queries that included clear semantic indicators of object type and artist (i.e. Were there any paintings by Otto Dix sold at Fischer in 1939?) \uf095 Vague or Broad \u2013more general queries detailing what the targeted object(s) may look like or possible object features (i.e. Please retrieve any",

For specific queries, this was straightforward; however, broader, or semantically vague queries could only be approximated using keyword searches. To assess the semantic retrieval quality, we compared the top k RAG results to the SQL-derived records. A completeness score of 100% was assigned when all expected records were retrieved. If the RAG pipeline retrieved all expected records plus additional relevant ones, it was also rated 100%, reflecting its ability to surface contextually meaningful results beyond manual efforts. The average completeness and manual evaluation of the end GPT-output are noted below. Query Category Number of Queries Average Completeness (%) Average Output Rating Multilingual 2 100 3 Out-of-Scope / Irrelevant 3 100 2.67 Specific 8 85.2 2.88 Vague or Broad 7 64.3 2.29 The summary statistics demonstrate our approach\u2019s strong potential as a tool for provenance searches. Specific queries\u2014such as \u2018Were there any paintings by Otto Dix sold at Fischer in 1939?\u2019 and \u2018Charcoal drawings by Max Liebermann that are signed\u2019 provided consistently relevant record retrieval. Multilingual queries also performed well, with semantic representations enabling accurate retrieval across our control set of Russian and Mandarin search queries. Notably, the model showed an ability to interpret descriptive and material-based cues, such as identifying terracotta sculptures from indirect references like \u2018Gebrannter Ton,\u2019 (fired clay) suggesting promise for nuanced object-level interrogation. Out-of-scope queries were also handled effectively. For instance, the query \u2018suspended sharks in tanks exhibited at the Tate\u2019 was correctly identified as irrelevant, and no records were retrieved, showing reliable domain boundary control. Similarly, the query for 'a sculpture depicting a balloon dog by Koons' was filtered out appropriately, with GPT correctly inferring the artist\u2019s name and excluding unrelated results. However, the performance on vague or broad queries was less consistent. The query \u2018a drawing sold at auction attributed to an Italian artist of the 15th century\u2019 returned",
    "sculpture depicting a balloon dog by Koons' was filtered out appropriately, with GPT correctly inferring the artist\u2019s name and excluding unrelated results. However, the performance on vague or broad queries was less consistent. The query \u2018a drawing sold at auction attributed to an Italian artist of the 15th century\u2019 returned a painting instead of a drawing, indicating a failure in media-type filtering. Another query seeking \u2018sculptures sold by the authorities in Berlin\u2019 only partially matched, suggesting limitations in abstracting institutional references. While some vague queries were handled well\u2014such as the retrieval of \u2018gouache works depicting motifs of Venice\u2019\u2014the overall completeness and rating for this category were lower, highlighting the need for improved generalisation and semantic abstraction in both retrieval and generation stages. In summary our findings overall indicated that the RAG pipeline offered a viable and flexible solution for conducting provenance searches using natural language. It enables semantic retrieval even when specific filters are unknown and, in some cases, outperformed manual archival searches by surfacing semantically relevant records not identified through SQL. While the performance on ambiguous queries remains imperfect, the model shows promise for nuanced object-level interrogation and cross-lingual retrieval, supporting its potential as a research tool in art historical contexts. In the next section, we detail how our RAG approach compares to the current GPI search portal and how our RAG approach could complement the current standard. Workflow Comparison vs the Current GPI Search Portal The Getty Provenance Index (GPI) provides an online search portal designed to facilitate the structured exploration of its extensive provenance datasets. Its revamped architecture, grounded in CIDOC CRM and Linked Art frameworks, transforms flat-file records into a graph-based network of linked entities, such as artworks, individuals, locations, and events. The event-centric model of CIDOC CRM allows researchers to trace meaningful relationships among people, objects, and ideas by modelling events as temporally and spatially bounded contexts, rather than focusing solely on static object properties (Bruseker et al., 2017). Linked. Art offers a flexible, web-native data model that enables consistent, cross-collection discovery by linking cultural heritage records through shared entities and relationships, thereby enhancing usability and interoperability across institutions (Sanderson, 2017). This graph is useful for tracing intricate relationships and conducting precise metadata-driven searches. Users can perform both basic keyword queries and advanced facet-based searches, allowing detailed filtering across resource models and branches. However, the structured nature of the portal requires familiarity with specific metadata terms, institutional actors, or object classifications for effective use. In contrast, the RAG-based prototype introduces a flexible natural language interface that supports exploratory and multilingual queries, semantic abstraction, and contextual summarisation.

In contrast, the RAG-based prototype introduces a flexible natural language interface that supports exploratory and multilingual queries, semantic abstraction, and contextual summarisation. The main benefit of RAG over the current facility offered by Getty is the flexible and efficient natural langu1age-based search functionality of the RAG approach. This removes any technical barriers needed and means that searches can be conducted without precise knowledge of the objects\u2019 metadata. While the RAG-based approach offers significant advantages in accessibility and semantic flexibility for provenance research, it also raises important ethical considerations that we address in the following section. Ethical Considerations Provenance Research encompasses a wide array of historical contexts. Investigations related to German Sales data within the GPI frequently pertain to artworks looted during the Nazi era, particularly those expropriated from Jewish families. To address challenging histories and connections to dark episodes in both personal and national narratives, it is imperative to provide frameworks that are both practical and comprehensible to end users. The framework we have developed emphasises explainable information retrieval (referencing concepts raise by Dwivedi et al. 2017), which is structured to consistently involve a human expert in the process, commonly referred to as 'human-in-the-loop' workflows. Safdar et al. (2020) identify several critical ethical considerations in the use of AI-based applications, notably highlighting the risks associated with '\u2019Blackbox and Bias.\u2019 Our framework addresses this issue by offering contextually pertinent retrieval for an LLM to utilize in its summaries, thereby reducing the risk of fabricated responses. Additionally, when the context is summarized, we incorporate an evaluation step in the summary that details and justifies the inclusion or exclusion of records from the raw contextual retrieval. The following example is an extract from the final user output of the evaluation. Input Query: Were there any portraits of men by Rembrandt where the figure was wearing jewellery? GPT Generated Output: The research question is classified as object-based because it seeks information about specific artworks by Rembrandt featuring men wearing jewelry. Relevant Objects: \uf095 Title : Bildnis eines Polen mit hoher goldgeschm\u00fcckter Samtm\u00fctze , unter der das gelockte schwarze Haar herausquillt . Um den Hals zweireihige Goldkette mit Medaillon . \uf095 Artist : Rembrandt \uf095 Auction House : Hahn (Heinrich) \uf095 Material : Holz \uf095 Dimensions : 65 cm x 46 cm \uf095 Description : The portrait depicts a man wearing a richly adorned velvet cap and a double gold chain with a medallion around his neck. \uf095 Location : Not specified \uf095 Provenance Information : Not provided \uf095 Public Source : Hahn 1944 Auction Catalogue Explanation of Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: \uf095 The item 'Bildnis eines Polen mit hoher goldgeschm\u00fcckter Samtm\u00fctze' was included because it directly matches",
    "and a double gold chain with a medallion around his neck. \uf095 Location : Not specified \uf095 Provenance Information : Not provided \uf095 Public Source : Hahn 1944 Auction Catalogue Explanation of Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: \uf095 The item 'Bildnis eines Polen mit hoher goldgeschm\u00fcckter Samtm\u00fctze' was included because it directly matches the query's criteria: a portrait of a man by Rembrandt where the figure is wearing jewellery (a gold chain with a medallion). \uf095 Other items were excluded because of the absence of jewellery in the description or because they were not by Rembrandt. \uf095 The classification as object-based influenced the filtering by focusing on specific artworks rather than broader trends or patterns. Relevance Evaluation \uf095 Highly Relevant \u2013 ' Bildnis eines Polen mit hoher goldgeschm\u00fcckter Samtm\u00fctze ' by Rembrandt directly answers the query with a clear description of jewelry . \uf095 Irrelevant \u2013 'M\u00e4nnliches Bildnis' by Rembrandt does not mention jewellery . \uf095 Irrelevant \u2013 'Brustbild eines Mannes' by Rembrandt does not mention jewellery . \uf095 Irrelevant \u2013 ' Der Mann mit dem Goldhelm ' by Rembrandt does not mention jewelry. [...] This format ensures the results are interpretable and traceable to the original context provided by semantic retrieval. This traceability allows non-specialist end users to evaluate the query results and determine their applicability to broader research contexts. The final output was designed to maximise transparency by linking the filtered results to primary historical texts, enabling researchers to integrate the efficiencies of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with targeted archival references and research. The framework is specifically designed to address well- documented ethical concerns associated with AI-based tools. Bostrom and Yodkowsky identified four key risks in their analysis of domain-specific AI applications: bias and discrimination, lack of transparency, predictability and robustness, and accountability. In response to these risks, we addressed the ethical challenges of bias, transparency, predictability, and accountability through intentional design choices. By embedding enriched metadata directly into searchable text, we reduced the dependency on fragile keyword matching and mitigate discriminatory retrieval failures. The structured prompt design and traceable outputs of the pipeline ensure transparency and interpretability, allowing users to comprehend not only what was retrieved but also the rationale behind it. Predictability is reinforced through consistent semantic retrieval and robust handling of multilingual and irrelevant queries, and accountability is maintained by linking every result to its original archival source and providing clear inclusion/exclusion rationales. Our framework empowers researchers with flexible and explainable tools, while safeguarding against the unintended consequences of opaque or biased automation. As Provenance Research continues to digitise and scale, such ethically grounded AI systems will be essential for preserving trust, rigor, and historical integrity.

    "and explainable tools, while safeguarding against the unintended consequences of opaque or biased automation. As Provenance Research continues to digitise and scale, such ethically grounded AI systems will be essential for preserving trust, rigor, and historical integrity. Further Research The current model employs a Naive RAG pipeline, utilising solely auction entry text, which is supplemented with strategic metadata to enhance semantic retrieval. Several alternative strategies exist to augment the model's functionality and potentially improve retrieval accuracy, particularly for broader queries, where our evaluation identified certain deficiencies. Additionally, numerous combinations and RAG implementation options are available for assessment, including various semantic retrieval ranking methodologies. However, these approaches can become highly technical, necessitating a cautionary note that transparency and traceability for the end user should remain paramount in any architectural enhancement. Furthermore, the current prototype presents financial considerations. The architecture depends on proprietary models that incur costs, and scaling the RAG tool for a larger user base imposes significant expenses on the host. Consequently, exploring open-source embedding models and text summary models could be beneficial for reducing future maintenance costs. Further research could involve fine-tuning smaller end language models to perform the specific task of provenance search summary rather than relying on larger proprietary models that incur costs per search. The framework could also be expanded to incorporate other art market datasets, such as those hosted by the University of Heidelberg. Integrating digitised data from art market journals of the time could enhance the context provided and allow single searches to retrieve not only relevant auction records from the data but also any references made to relevant artworks in contemporary trade literature. Conclusion This study introduces and evaluates a RAG prototype specifically designed for art Provenance Research, utilising a 10k record sample from the Getty Provenance Index (GPI) \u2013 German Sales. By enriching raw auction entries with strategic metadata and embedding them as unified semantic units, the system enables flexible natural language querying, multilingual retrieval, and semantic abstraction. This approach also facilitates the integration of unstructured or inconsistently structured data from diverse sources into a single searchable corpus, an essential capability given the heterogeneity of historical art market records. It also offers a framework that could ingest other unstructured data sources into one tool, allowing researchers to query across formats without requiring standardised schemas or rigid metadata alignment. The evaluation results indicated robust performance in specific and multilingual queries, with some limitations in vague or abstract searches. These findings underscore the potential of RAG- based systems to support both targeted and exploratory Provenance Research, while also identifying areas for future refinement in semantic generalisation and media-type filtering. Ethical safeguards are embedded throughout the framework, directly addressing the risks identified by Bostrom and",
    "in vague or abstract searches. These findings underscore the potential of RAG- based systems to support both targeted and exploratory Provenance Research, while also identifying areas for future refinement in semantic generalisation and media-type filtering. Ethical safeguards are embedded throughout the framework, directly addressing the risks identified by Bostrom and Yudkowsky in domain-specific AI applications: bias, transparency, predictability, and accountability. The system design ensures traceable outputs, human-in-the- loop workflows, and contextual grounding in primary archival sources, mitigating the risks of opaque or fabricated responses. Rather than replacing existing tools such as the Getty Provenance Index portal, the RAG prototype complements them by offering an additional exploratory interface. It empowers researchers to navigate complex historical datasets with greater efficiency while preserving the rigor and contextual sensitivity required in Provenance Research. As digitisation efforts expand and AI technologies evolve, this prototype offers a foundation for ethically grounded, scalable, and user-friendly information retrieval in the cultural heritage sector. Future iterations may incorporate open-source models, multimodal data, and hybrid retrieval strategies; however, the core principles of explainability, transparency, and human oversight must remain central to any such development.

    "It\u2019s All About In-Context Learning! Teaching Extremely Low-Resource Languages to LLMs Yue Li, Zhixue Zhao and Carolina Scarton Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield, UK {yli381,zhixue.zhao,c.scarton}@sheffield.ac.uk Abstract Extremely low-resource languages, especially those written in rare scripts, as shown in Fig- ure 1, remain largely unsupported by large lan- guage models (LLMs). This is due in part to compounding factors such as the lack of training data. This paper delivers the first comprehensive analysis of whether LLMs can acquire such languages purely via in-context learning (ICL), with or without auxiliary align- ment signals, and how these methods compare to parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We systematically evaluate 20 under-represented languages across three state-of-the-art multi- lingual LLMs. Our findings highlight the limitation of PEFT when both language and its script are extremely under-represented by the LLM. In contrast, zero-shot ICL with lan- guage alignment is impressively effective on extremely low-resource languages, while few- shot ICL or PEFT is more beneficial for lan- guages relatively better represented by LLMs. For LLM practitioners working on extremely low-resource languages, we summarise guide- lines grounded by our results on adapting LLMs to low-resource languages, e.g., avoiding fine-tuning a multilingual model on languages of unseen scripts. 1 Introduction Current large language models (LLMs) are typi- cally pre-trained with data in more than 50 lan- guages, offering robust support for high-resource languages, such as German and French (Le Scao et al., 2023; Grattafiori et al., 2024; Team et al., 2023). However, their coverage of low-resource languages remains limited. Since these languages are often spoken in developing regions, insufficient LLM support risks reinforcing socio-economic dis- parities and further isolating affected communi- ties (Shen et al., 2024; Jadhav et al., 2024). 1https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/ languages Figure 1: Regional distribution of the languages stud- ied in this paper. Red denotes the five languages with rare scripts, and blue represents the other 15 languages. Y (yes) and N (no) denote whether it\u2019s supported by Google Translate1. Accuracy represents performance on topic classification (SIB-200) with DeepSeek (7b) in zero-shot ICL (majority voting = 0.25, English = 0.83). Extending LLMs to support extremely low- resource languages via continued pre-training (Yong et al., 2023a) is possible but often imprac- tical, due to the need for large-scale monolingual corpora and substantial computational resources (Joshi et al., 2020). Although LLM support can be achieved for downstream tasks via resource- efficient training, such as parameter-efficient fine- tuning (PEFT), it still requires a non-trivial amount of labeled data. Therefore, with recent advances in in-context learning (ICL), we ask whether LLMs can learn new languages purely through ICL (Yong et al., 2023b; Zhang et al., 2024; Cahyaw- ijaya et al., 2024).

Therefore, with recent advances in in-context learning (ICL), we ask whether LLMs can learn new languages purely through ICL (Yong et al., 2023b; Zhang et al., 2024; Cahyaw- ijaya et al., 2024).

(3) ICL or PEFT, which one is a better choice for learning a new language? In this study, we consider 20 low-resource lan- guages, including five extremely low-resource ones arXiv:2508.19089v1 [cs.CL] 26 Aug 2025 Language Script Translator | Accuracy Dzongkha (dzo) | 2asragxa% ajar (Tibetan) Y 0.128 Santali (sat) GACoHZVBL (Ol Chiki) N 0.172 Nko (nqo) 0 TS ScfTHIA (NKo) N 0.137 Tamasheq (taq) IOote (Tifinagh) N 0.118 Tigrinya (tir) 9\u00b0%-b 71 1 (Ge'ez) Y 0.186 Method Data Training Annotator EN Target Other Zero-shot ICL baseline \u2717 \u2717 \u2717 \u2717 \u2717 sentence-level alignment \u2713(k) \u2713(k) \u2717 \u2717 translate word-level alignment \u2717 \u2717 dict. \u2717 \u2717 word-level translation \u2717 \u2717 dict. \u2717 \u2717 Few-shot ICL demonstration in target language \u2717 \u2713(k) \u2717 \u2717 label demonstration with alignment \u2713(k) \u2713(k) \u2717 \u2717 label+translate Parameter efficient fine-tuning \u2717 \u2713(N) \u2717 \u2713 label Table 1: List of methods used in this paper and resources they may rely on: (1) Data: in-domain data in English (EN) or target language (Target), or a dictionary (dict.) for word translation; k denotes k-shot examples, and N denotes the full training data (k \u226aN); (2) Training: whether model parameters are updated; (3) Annotator: whether native speakers are needed to label the data, or translate data to English to enable alignment. (Figure 1) and 15 written in Latin, Arabic, or Cyril- lic scripts (referred to as target languages2). ICL with auxiliary signals (i.e., class category, language alignment) is explored. Our setup (Table 1) in- cludes few-shot ICL, sentence-level alignment of unlabelled or labelled examples in zero-shot or few- shot ICL, and word-level alignment for the target language in zero-shot ICL. To our knowledge, this is the first study to sys- tematically analyse whether ICL can enable LLMs to learn extremely low-resource languages. Our main findings are: \u2022 In contrast to prior work (Razumovskaia et al., 2024), small-scaled fine-tuning is generally inef- fective when a language and its script are highly under-represented or entirely absent from both the tokenizer and pre-training data (e.g., sat, nqo and taq on DeepSeek). \u2022 In such cases, zero-shot ICL with language align- ment yields substantial gains, potentially surpass- ing vocabulary extension on multilingual pre- trained language models (PLMs) through con- tinue pre-training. \u2022 Zero-shot ICL with language alignment is es- pecially effective for languages with minimal LLM",

Various methods have been explored for training efficiency (Zhang et al., 2021; Yong et al., 2023a; Cui et al., 2023), vocabulary and tokeniser adaptation (Yamaguchi et al., 2024a; Balachandran, 2023; Cui et al., 2023; Larcher et al., 2023) and data efficiency (Yamaguchi et al., 2024b; Shaham et al., 2024; Kurz et al., 2024). However, the effective- ness of these pretraining-based methods often de- pends on the availability of large-scale training data, an assumption that does not hold for extremely low- resource languages in real-world scenarios. Adapting LLMs to Low-Resource Languages for Downstream Tasks ICL with different strate- gies has been explored to improve LLMs\u2019 adap- tation to low-resource languages, including tech- niques such as code-switching (Yong et al., 2023b; Schlicht et al., 2025), demonstration example se- lection (Winata et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2024; Tanwar et al., 2023), prompt format optimization (Zhang et al., 2023; Cahyawijaya et al., 2024), machine translation (Bandarkar et al., 2024), and dictionary-based prompting (Lu et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024). Another promising direction is PEFT, which has demonstrated superior performance with computational costs comparable to few-shot ICL (Liu et al., 2022). However, most existing studies focus on languages that are: (1) relatively high- resource (e.g., German); (2) low-resource but writ- ten in widely supported scripts (e.g., Zhuang in Latin script (Zhang et al., 2024)); and (3) writ- ten in rare scripts but already included in model pre-training (Razumovskaia et al., 2024). Con- sequently, how to effectively adapt LLMs to ex- tremely low-resource languages such as nqo (Fig- ure 1) is still unclear. 3 Learning Extremely Low-Resource Languages Table 1 summarises the experimented approaches and assumed available data resources.

Standard cross-lingual transfer that aims to improve and then transfer task knowledge from English is not consid- ered in this study (i.e, fine-tuning with English data or few-shot ICL with English examples), as the LLMs have already demonstrated high accuracy on English in zero-shot ICL (Table 4)3. Baseline The vanilla zero-shot ICL when the LLMs are prompted only with task description and the target language input tgt. We use English task description as it has been widely adopted showing improvements in ICL performance (Zhang et al., 2023; Razumovskaia et al., 2024). The prompt format is: [<task description> + <inputtgt>]. Zero-Shot ICL with alignment we experiment with adding word- or sentence-level alignment be- tween English and a target language in the prompt, without providing labelled examples. \u2022 Word-level alignment: We provide a translation for each word in the target-language input using a dictionary, inspired by prior work on machine translation (Zhang et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024). The prompt format for an inputtgt with N words {wtgt 1 , wtgt 2 , ..., wtgt N } is: [<task description> + <inputtgt> + <wtgt 1 means weng 1 in English; ...; wtgt N means weng N in English>]. We use the NLLB translator4 (Costa-Juss\u00e0 et al., 2022) to create the dictionaries following Lu et al. (2024). For lan- guages not supported by NLLB (nqo, sat5, and min), we train the word alignment tool fast_align (Dyer et al., 2013) to simulate a high-quality dic- tionary (See Appendix B). \u2022 Word-level translation: We directly concatenate the English word translations in their orders in target languages as the \u201cEnglish\u201d translation (i.e., inputeng\u2032 = concat (weng 1 , ..., weng N )), and prompt LLMs with: [<task description> + inputeng\u2032]. 3Machine translating target-languages into English is not considered, since our aim is to teach low-resource languages to LLMs. Reliable machine translators are also not available for 3 out of 5 rare-script languages. In practice, developing a high- quality machine translator is significantly more expensive than creating the data resources we consider here. 4https://huggingface.co/facebook/nllb-200-3. 3B 5NLLB repeats the same word without stopping \u2022 Sentence-level alignment: Assuming there is a limited k number of parallel in-domain unla- belled sentences in English {seng 1 ,...,seng k } and target language {stgt 1 ,...,stgt k }.

Few-Shot ICL Assuming there is a limited num- ber of labelled in-domain data samples in the target language or English, demonstration examples from the training data are retrieved by BM25, inspired by Zhang et al.

PEFT We preliminarily experiment with com- petitive methods such as LoRA (Hu et al., 2022), DoRA (Liu et al., 2024) and IA3 (Liu et al., 2022). Same as Yong et al. (2023a), we found that IA3 is the most effective and efficient approach. There- fore, due to computational constraints, we only ex- periment with IA3 as a representative of the PEFT methods. We also discuss the comparison with fully fine-tuned multilingual PLMs in Section 4.4. 3.1 Experimental Setups Target Languages We mainly ground our re- search on the SIB-200 seven-way topic classifica- tion dataset (Adelani et al., 2024), as it offers par- allel training and evaluation data with the broadest multilingual coverage in natural language under- standing (NLU) tasks. We also analyse the general- isability of our findings on reading comprehension (i.e., BELEBELE (Bandarkar et al., 2024)), which is a more challenging task than topic classification. Since most prevalent LLMs do not disclose com- prehensive lists of languages present in their pre- training data, we select the low-resource languages for which LLMs exhibit significantly limited capa- bility. We measure the LLMs\u2019 capability on each language with Information Parity (IP) (Tsvetkov and Kipnis, 2024) on the SIB training data. Given a text in the target language and its English transla- tion, IP is defined as the ratio between the negative log-likelihood of the target-language text and that of its English counterpart under the same model. A very low IP score indicates that the LLM strug- gles to represent information in the target language, likely due to limited or no exposure during pretrain- ing. Based on this criterion, we select the languages with the average lowest IP scores across the LLMs we study on. This includes five languages writ- ten in relatively rare and distinct scripts",
    "gles to represent information in the target language, likely due to limited or no exposure during pretrain- ing. Based on this criterion, we select the languages with the average lowest IP scores across the LLMs we study on. This includes five languages writ- ten in relatively rare and distinct scripts (Figure 1) plus 15 languages using more commonly sup- ported scripts (i.e., seven in Latin, four in Arabic, and four in Cyrillic). For the latter, we select lan- guages that do not have the same linguistic roots as English (Latin script), Modern Standard Arabic (Arabic script) and Russian (Cyrillic script), which are commonly represented in LLMs\u2019 training data. The full list of the languages is shown in Table 2. Models We experiment with three recent open- source instruction-tuned LLMs with multilingual ability: DeepSeek6, LlaMA-3.27 and Gemma-28. Due to computational constraints, their medium- sized variants are considered. Setups We adopt accuracy as the evaluation met- ric following Adelani et al. (2024). We use greedy search in decoding for the purpose of reproducibil- ity. The prompt template for baseline zero-shot ICL is also used in PEFT for a fair comparison. SIB- 200 dataset\u2019s official train/dev/test set split is used. The examples included in zero-shot and few-shot ICL are retrieved from the training data. As pre- processing for BM25, only white-space splitting is applied. The hyper-parameter tuning and training details for IA3 are included in Appendix B. 4 Results 4.1 Limitation of Fine-Tuning Fine-tuning Improvement Disparity Figure 2 illustrates the performance improvement after fine- tuning with the training data in the target language. 6https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/ deepseek-llm-7b-chat 7https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3. 2-3B-Instruct 8https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-2-2b-it In most cases, fine-tuning leads to enhanced perfor- mance, although the degree of improvement varies notably. For low-resource languages using com- mon scripts, accuracy scores can rise to more than 0.6 on average, resulting in an acceptable perfor- mance (full results in Table 4). In contrast, results on the five languages written in rare scripts are in- consistent. For instance, while DeepSeek performs worse than majority voting on all of these five lan- guages in the baseline zero-shot ICL setting, PEFT raises the accuracy scores of dzo and tir to above 0.45. In contrast, gains for the remaining three languages are rather modest, particularly for sat, which still stays slightly below majority voting. We observe that this discrepancy is due to overfitting, which appears to occur at a very early stage in the fine-tuning for languages showing limited improve- ment. Risk of Overfitting and Impact Factors To gain more insights on why certain languages suffer more severe overfitting, we analyse: \u2022 Tokenization efficiency: Most LLMs\u2019 tokenis- ers, including those used by the three models in our study, adopt byte-level Byte Pair Encod- ing (BPE) (Wang",
    "languages showing limited improve- ment. Risk of Overfitting and Impact Factors To gain more insights on why certain languages suffer more severe overfitting, we analyse: \u2022 Tokenization efficiency: Most LLMs\u2019 tokenis- ers, including those used by the three models in our study, adopt byte-level Byte Pair Encod- ing (BPE) (Wang et al., 2020) or SentencePiece (Kudo and Richardson, 2018). When encounter- ing texts in rare scripts not seen during tokeniser training, characters are often segmented into raw bytes, resulting in a vocabulary with drastically reduced effectiveness. For instance, BPE tokenis- ers based on UTF-8 encoding may end up repre- senting an entire rare-script language using only 256 raw-byte token values (Wang et al., 2020), limiting the model\u2019s ability to learn generalisable linguistic patterns with small training data (Zhao and Aletras, 2024). Tokenisation efficiency for a given text i is measured using Token-to-Byte Ratio (TBR) = numi tokens numi bytes , where numi bytes is the number of bytes required to represent the text with the same encoding system used in the to- keniser, and numi tokens is the number of tokens produced by the LLM\u2019s tokeniser. A TBR score close to 1 indicates that the tokeniser is operating nearly at the raw byte level, signalling extremely poor tokenisation. For example, the average TBR for sat\u2019s training data with DeepSeek\u2019s tokeniser is 0.99, suggesting that nearly every character is segmented into raw bytes and that DeepSeek sig- nificantly lacks meaningful representations for sat.

Names of the languages with PEFT performances lower than 0.4 are marked in red. \u2022 Multilingual capability: Fine-tuning is usually more effective when the LLM has already ac- quired some linguistic competence in the target language during pre-training. IP is used again to estimate the LLMs\u2019 capabilities for each target language prior to fine-tuning. As discussed in Section 3.1, the higher the IP value the more effi- ciently the LLM represents information provided in the target language. Conversely, a low IP score suggests under-representation of a language. Figure 3 shows the average TBR and IP scores for",
    "for each target language prior to fine-tuning. As discussed in Section 3.1, the higher the IP value the more effi- ciently the LLM represents information provided in the target language. Conversely, a low IP score suggests under-representation of a language. Figure 3 shows the average TBR and IP scores for each target language in the training data, also presenting their correlations with fine-tuning per- formance. Languages with high TBR and low IP scores are the ones where fine-tuning tends to en- counter more severely overfitting, resulting in very limited generalisation. This suggests that small- scaled fine-tuning on downstream tasks is unlikely to be beneficial when a language and its script are highly under-represented or even unseen in both to- keniser training and model pre-training. This find- ing also highlights the importance of improving rep- resentation of low-resource languages and scripts during pre-training. Even modest improvements in representation, either at tokeniser or model pre- training level, can lead to notably more effective find-tuning adaptation. For instance, although tir, sat, and nqo are nearly entirely tokenised as raw bytes by DeepSeek\u2019s tokeniser (TBR > 0.99), DeepSeek exhibits stronger pre-trained capabilities on tir (higher IP) compared to sat and nqo, trans- lating into more substantial gains from fine-tuning. Similarly, while LLaMA-3.2 shows comparable IP scores for both dzo and tir, dzo benefits from better tokenisation (lower TBR, i.e. higher 1 \u2212 TBR), potentially leading to larger performance improvement after fine-tuning. 4.2 Alignment in Zero-Shot ICL 4.2.1 Sentence-Level Alignment Effectiveness of Semantic Similar Examples Figure 4 shows DeepSeek\u2019s performance when prompted with one unlabeled example in the target language alongside its English translation. Similar trends are observed for LLaMA-3.2 and Gemma-2, with detailed results in the Appendix C. Although the topic label of the example is not included in the prompt, incorporating semantically similar texts in both target language and English significantly enhances performance for low-resource languages with low baseline zero-shot ICL performances, es- pecially those using rarer scripts. However, this benefit diminishes as the baseline zero-shot ICL performance improves.

In con- trast, for languages with baseline scores above 0.3, the average improvement falls below 0.07. In some cases, LLaMA-3.2 and Gemma-2 exhibit minor per- formance declines, with the largest drops being 0.1 for kaz on both LLaMA-3.2 and Gemma-2 (base- line = 0.59 and 0.61 respectively). Furthermore, the models\u2019 performance often degrade when ex- amples are randomly sampled from the training set, highlighting that the effectiveness of the alignment hinges on the semantic similarity between the input text and the example in target language. More- over, improving semantic search for low-resource languages or even enhancing text pre-processing approaches (e.g., lemmatisation and stemming), beyond the simple whitespace-based tokenisation used here, has the potential to increase performance in this sentence-alignment setting. Impact of the Number of Examples We further analyse the performance when varying the num- ber of unlabelled parallel examples provided in the prompt, from two to five examples. We find that in- creasing the number of randomly sampled parallel examples in the prompt could slightly improve the performance, although the gap between BM25 sam- pled examples is still notable. However, providing more semantic related examples does not consis- tently improve performance across all languages. We hypothesize that it may be influenced by the relative length of the target-language sequences compared to English. To test this, we compute the average tokenizer parity (TP) scores (Petrov et al., 2023) for each language in the training set (in Table 2). Given a text in its target language and English translation, TP is defined as the ratio of the number of tokens in English to the number of tokens in the target language. A lower TP score indicates that the target language is tokenized into relatively longer sequences compared to English. We define a binary variable indicating whether adding more examples is beneficial: it is set to true if at least 3 out of the 4 multi-shot settings (2, 3, 4, and 5 examples) outperform the 1-shot setting. We then calculate the point-biserial correlation coefficient (Lev, 1949) between the TP score and this binary in- dicator. The results show a statistically significant correlation, suggesting that languages with lower TP scores are less likely to benefit from additional parallel unlabelled examples. 4.2.2 Word-Level Alignment (a) chrf++",

Red denotes baseline zero-shot ICL. The zero-shot ICL performance with word-level alignment or translation on LLaMA-3.2 is shown in Figure 5. The reported chrf++ score9 of each lan- guage on NLLB is used as an indicator of the qual- ity of the dictionary. For DeepSeek and Gemma-2 (full results in Appendix C), adopting word-level alignment or translation always improve the per- formance over the baseline. However, LLaMA- 3.2\u2019s performance is highly influenced by the dic- tionary\u2019s quality. When the chrf++ score is lower than 0.5 (Figure 5a), including the low-quality word-level alignment (gray lines) can harm the per- formance (e.g., fuv, kac, wol, and azb). In con- trast, when chrf++ score is higher than 0.5 (Figure 5b), word-level alignment is always beneficial. For nqo, sat, and min, we train fast_align on the SIB- 9https://tinyurl.com/nllb200dense3bmetrics azb tat Nus 200 dataset to simulate a high-quality dictionary (see Section 3). LLMs\u2019 performance for these lan- guages is always improved with word-level align- ment (around 0.6 of accuracy improvement), high- lighting the importance of the dictionary quality. ICL with word-level translation significantly re- duces the inference time than using word-level alignment by reducing input length.. However, its performance exhibits variable superiority across languages and LLMs. Specifically, it is consistently better than world-level alignment on LLaMA-3.2, while it is always worse than world-level or even baseline on DeepSeek and Gemma-2. 4.3 Alignment in Few-Shot ICL For languages with baseline accuracy lower than majority voting, including English translations in few-shot ICL often improves results across all the LLMs, when using more than one demonstration example. However, in 1-shot ICL, removing the En- glish translation tends to yield better performance on DeepSeek and LLaMA-3.2, while Gemma-2 continues to benefit from them. For languages with strong zero-shot ICL performance, both DeepSeek and Gemma-2 benefit from the alignment, whereas LLaMA-3.2 performs best without them. Over- all, unlike the consistent trends across LLMs in zero-shot ICL with alignment, we observe more variations how LLMs respond to aligned prompts in few-shot scenarios (full results in Appendix C). Although not examined by prior work (Cahyaw- ijaya et al., 2024), we find that model perfor- mance can be highly sensitive to the order of the task description and demonstration examples in the prompt, for certain",
    "how LLMs respond to aligned prompts in few-shot scenarios (full results in Appendix C). Although not examined by prior work (Cahyaw- ijaya et al., 2024), we find that model perfor- mance can be highly sensitive to the order of the task description and demonstration examples in the prompt, for certain languages, especially on DeepSeek. For example, when prompting Deepseek with 1-shot labelled nqo example with English translation, the accuracy jumps from 0.30 to 0.42 if the task description is moved to af- ter the demonstration example. In most of the cases, prompting with demonstrations at the be- ginning lead to better performance for DeepSeek and Gemma-2, while LLaMA-3.2 slightly prefers task description at the beginning. Results presented for few-shot ICL are based on the optimal task de- scription position selected on the validation set.

We present the results in Figure 6 for LLaMA-3.2. DeepSeek and Gemma-2 show same trend (see Appendix C). Fine-Tuning vs. ICL When the low-resource language is extremely under-represented in both to- keniser and model (Figure 6a), fine-tuning LLMs or even PLMs11 yields minimal improvement, while zero-shot ICL with either sentence- or word-level alignment offers significant improvements (Fig- ure 2a vs. 4a). Adelani et al. (2024) extended the vocabulary of XLM-R for nqo with continue- pretraining, leading to fine-tuning accuracy on SIB- 200 test set rising 0.17 points. However, it is still lower than the performances of LLMs in zero-shot ICL with alignment, which are above 0.41. For the remaining low-resource languages (Fig- ure 6b and 6c), fine-tuning normally has better performance than ICL. Overall, the average differ- ence between PEFT and the best ICL approach on DeepSeek, LLaMA-3.2 and Gemma-2 is 0.13, 0.13, and 0.08, respectively.

(2024), see Table 4. Sat taq formance (i.e., accuracy < 0.45 on all LLMs), in most cases (at least more than 50%), zero-shot ICL with word/sentence-level alignment leads to better performance than few-shot ICL regardless if the alignment is provided or not (Figure 6b, comparing black and blue lines). When baseline performance is higher than 0.45 (Figure 6c), few-shot ICL al- ways provides best results. In our study, these languages are khk, tgk, azb, eus, tat, kaz, and urd, consistent across all the LLMs. Overall, if the LLM significantly lacks capability on the target language, providing label in ICL might be useless. 5 Discussion 5.1 NLU Tasks beyond Topic Classification We test our findings on BELEBELE, a reading com- prehension parallel multilingual dataset, covering 11 out of the 20 languages studied here. It con- tains questions with four multiple-choice answers linked to a passage. tir is available among the five languages with rare scripts. We split the data into training, validation and test, following SIB-200, to enable a consistent comparison (See Appendix C). We conduct experiments only on LLaMA-3.2, due to its long context length and computational con- straints. We retrieve the passage from the training data with BM25 as example and provide its En- glish translation as passage alignment. We adopt accuracy for evaluation (Bandarkar et al., 2024). Most results align with our observations on SIB- 200 dataset. Specifically, PEFT still shows no im- provement for tir, while being more effective for other languages. Zero-shot ICL with passage align- ment could still improve over the baseline zero-shot ICL in most cases, especially for the languages with lower baseline performance (e.g., accuracy < 0.35). However, as the task is more challenging, the level of improvement is not as notable as on topic classification. The model also potentially requires more unlabelled parallel data for consistent im- provements across all languages. Similar to topic classification, in most cases, zero-shot ICL with passage alignment surpasses few-shot ICL when baseline performance is lower than 0.5. Conversely, word-level alignment is not effec- tive on reading comprehension, which may be ex- plained by the quality of the dictionary created. Un- like topic classification, whose prediction can be made based on one or two topic-related words, read- ing comprehension relies less on such cue words, requiring a higher quality of word translations. 5.2 Suggestions to Practitioners In practice, performance is not the only consid- eration.

Un- like topic classification, whose prediction can be made based on one or two topic-related words, read- ing comprehension relies less on such cue words, requiring a higher quality of word translations. 5.2 Suggestions to Practitioners In practice, performance is not the only consid- eration. Investment in data and computational re- sources needs to be carefully considered, especially for low-resource languages. Aiming to adapt an LLM to a low-resource language for a downstream task, which approach should be prioritized, and what types of data should be created? For low-resource languages that are extremely under-represented in both tokeniser and model (e.g., nqo) fine-tuning is not effective and zero- shot ICL with alignment shows promising improve- ments. We suggest prioritizing investment in hu- man translation to create a small-scale in-domain parallel data for zero-shot ICL with alignment. For low-resource languages where LLMs demonstrate limited capability few-shot ICL might lead to better performance than zero-shot ICL with alignment. However, in most cases, these gains are modest and may even come at the risk of performance degradation. With fine-tuning LLM/PLM being effective and with acceptable zero-shot ICL performance for these languages, decisions should be made by comparing the finan- cial costs between human translation (for zero-shot ICL) and human annotation (for fine-tuning). For low-resource languages where LLMs demonstrate a certain level of capability few- shot leads to better performance than zero-shot ICL with alignment. Human annotation tends to be required for a notable improvement for these lan- guages. Practitioners should consider the trade-off between the amount of data to annotate (effective fine-tuning may require more data than few-shot ICL) and the computational costs (LLM inference is more expensive than fine-tuning PLMs). 6 Conclusion This work provides a systematic analysis on whether ICL can enable LLMs to effectively sup- port extremely low-resource languages on down- stream tasks. As some of the key findings that contrast to prior work, we reveal the limitation of fine-tuning when languages and their scripts are both highly under-represented. In such cases, zero- shot ICL augmented with word- or sentence-level alignment yields promising results. Meanwhile, few-shot ICL or PEFT tends to perform better for languages relatively better represented during pre- training. Our study highlights the importance of language and script coverage in LLMs, and the strong potential of ICL for language adaptation. Limitations Although we conducted more than 450 experi- ments, our study did not include other popular LLMs, such as Mistral and Qwen. Due to our computational constraints and consideration of fair comparison with PEFT on same LLM size, we did not experiment with LLMs with large sizes, such as Gemma-2 (9b) 12 or LLaMA-3.3 (70b) 13. Future work could explore whether a larger LLM could enable even",
    "such as Mistral and Qwen. Due to our computational constraints and consideration of fair comparison with PEFT on same LLM size, we did not experiment with LLMs with large sizes, such as Gemma-2 (9b) 12 or LLaMA-3.3 (70b) 13. Future work could explore whether a larger LLM could enable even more improvement in ICL with word- or sentence level language alignment. Due to very limited datasets with parallel data available for these extremely low-resource lan- guages, we covered topic classification and reading comprehension in this study. On reading compre- hension, we were only able to experiment with 11 of the 20 target languages. Both SIB-200 and BELEBELE are constructed based on Flores-200 dataset (Costa-Juss\u00e0 et al., 2022). With the increase of language coverage for NLP tasks in the future, our findings could be tested on other tasks (e.g., common-sense reasoning or summarization.) and other domains (e.g., medical, social media). As a lack of native speakers and reliable gold- standard word translations, we were not able to accurately access the quality of the dictionary that we created using NLLB translator or fastalign. Our study does not show promising results when using the created dictionary to assist reading comprehen- sion in ICL. However, as discussed in the main content, the results might be improved with a better dictionary. But the effectiveness on SIB-200 and ineffectiveness on BELEBELE imply that for chal- lenging tasks with long input length, word transla- tion quality is more important than for tasks with shorter input. Also, we directly translate words into English to simulate a dictionary following prior work. However, in practice, using a real-world dictionary raises additional challenges such as han- dling lexical ambiguity and polysemy, which may also impact the performance of word-level align- ment in zero-shot ICL. As very limited parallel corpus available for our target languages, we did not systematically analyse how the ICL performance would be impacted if the 12https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-2-9b 13https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3. 3-70B-Instruct included unlabelled parallel text is out-of-domain (e.g., from another dataset). However, since ran- domly sampled examples from the training data already poses risk of performance degradation, we hypothesise that zero-shot sentence-level alignment with out-of-domain examples might demonstrate limited benefit.

Ad- ditionally, we observed that explicitly indicating the language of the input text had no impact on per- formance. For extremely low-resource languages such as Nko and Santali, LLaMA-3.2 and Gemma- 2 refuse to perform the task if prompted with \"....complete the following example\", stating that they do not recognize the input language, no matter whether the name of the language is explicitly given in the prompt or not. However, they would pro- duce a prediction when prompted with \"complete the following example without explanations\". For sentence-level alignment, the LLMs are instructed as \"Use the following pairs of {language name} texts and their English translations to help you un- derstand {language name}.{alignment example}. Now based on your understanding, answer the question below without explanation.\". For word- 14https://github.com/facebookresearch/belebele/ blob/main/sample_zero_shot_instructions.md level alignment, we instruct LLMs with \"Please use the provided English translation of each word to help you understand the {language name} text.\".

Then we use NLLB-200 trans- lator (3.3B)15 to translate each word into English. For the three languages that are not supported by NLLB, we train the word alignment tool fast_align (Dyer et al., 2013) with SIB-200 training data and then align the English words and target-language words in the test set. We use the default training and alignment settings in fast_align16. IA3 The rescale vectors are learnt for key, value of the attention modules and feed-forward network in each layer. We use batch size as 4, and early stop- ping strategy based on validation loss, with max training epochs as 10. We use AdamW (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2019) for optimization. We perform hyper-parameter search on learning rate of {1e-3, 5e-3, 8e-3, 1e-2}. The optimal learning rate on validation set is 8e-3. For extremely low-resource languages where IA3 show limited improvement, we also search learning rate from {1e-4, 3e-3, 7e- 3}. We run experiments 3 times and report the average performance.

    "\"Where does it hurt?\" - Dataset and Study on Physician Intent Trajectories in Doctor Patient Dialogues Tom R\u00f6hra, Soumyadeep Royb,1, Fares Al Mohamadc,1, Jens-Michalis Papaioannoua,d, Wolfgang Nejdld, Felix Gersa and Alexander L\u00f6sera aBerlin University of Applied Sciences, Data Science and Text-based Information Systems Group bIndian Institute of Technology Kharagpur cCharit\u00e9 \u2013 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin Rheumatologie dL3S Research Center, Hannover Abstract. In a doctor-patient dialogue, the primary objective of physicians is to diagnose patients and propose a treatment plan. Med- ical doctors guide these conversations through targeted questioning to efficiently gather the information required to provide the best pos- sible outcomes for patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies physician intent trajectories in doctor-patient dialogues. We use the \u2018Ambient Clinical Intelligence Benchmark\u2019 (Aci-bench) dataset for our study. We collaborate with medical pro- fessionals to develop a fine-grained taxonomy of physician intents based on the SOAP framework (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan). We then conduct a large-scale annotation effort to la- bel over 5000 doctor-patient turns with the help of a large num- ber of medical experts recruited using Prolific, a popular crowd- sourcing platform. This large labeled dataset is an important re- source contribution that we use for benchmarking the state-of-the- art generative and encoder models for medical intent classification tasks. Our findings show that our models understand the general structure of medical dialogues with high accuracy, but often fail to identify transitions between SOAP categories. We also report for the first time common trajectories in medical dialogue structures that provide valuable insights for designing \u2018differential diagnosis\u2019 systems. Finally, we extensively study the impact of intent filter- ing for medical dialogue summarization and observe a significant boost in performance. We make the codes and data, including anno- tation guidelines, publicly available at https://github.com/DATEXIS/ medical-intent-classification. 1 Introduction Doctor-patient dialogues are complex interactions where physicians must efficiently gather information, reason through differential diag- noses, and formulate treatment plans. While NLP research has made significant strides in tasks like medical entity recognition [34], sum- marization [20], and dialogue act classification [3], most of the work in differential diagnosis modeling focuses primarily on retrospective clinical notes [10, 11]. However, these notes often present a flattened and post hoc representation of patient information, neglecting the dynamic trajectories during real-time clinical conversations. These dynamic trajectories are non-linear and an evolving process of clini- cal reasoning during patient encounters. Clinicians often revise their 1 Equal contribution.

We include an additional category called others, which in- herits the Chitchat intent. assessments and decisions as new information emerges throughout the consultation. This dynamic process involves continuous interpre- tation and re-interpretation of patient data, which is challenging to capture in static notes. In contrast to static notes, dialogues capture the evolving intents of physicians as they navigate the complexities of a patient encounter. Works such as AMIE [31] demonstrate that state-of-the-art language models can effectively simulate clinical interviews by synthesizing patient interactions. Nonetheless, how physicians transition between these steps remains largely unexplored. To the best of our knowl- edge, we present the first comprehensive study of physician intent trajectories within medical dialogues using Aci-bench [38], one of the richest datasets of doctor-patient interactions. In close collabo- ration with medical professionals, we introduce a fine-grained tax- onomy of physician intents as shown in Figure 1, based on the es- tablished SOAP framework [32] as our first research contribution. This fine-grained taxonomy includes multiple intents per SOAP cat- egory, thus providing a highly detailed representation of how clini- cians navigate patient engagements. As our second research contribution, we annotate the Aci-bench dataset with the proposed intent taxonomy and make it publicly avail- able. Through a large-scale crowd-sourcing effort with around 90 medical experts recruited through the Prolific platform from across the globe, we annotate more than 5,000 dialogue turns, creating a unique resource for analyzing physician trajectories in clinical con- versations. The general structure of trajectories during a differential diagnosis [23] is shown in Figure 2. We strongly believe this annotated dataset will facilitate and en- courage more research in this critical, under-explored research area. arXiv:2508.19077v1 [cs.CL] 26 Aug 2025 Acute Symptoms Greetings Discussion Acute Assessment Conversation Start Conversation End Physical Examination Medication Referral Follow-up Therapeutic History Physician intents trajectory in a clinical conversation Figure 2: Physician intent trajectory during a clinical conversation.

    "a clinical assessment. Finally, the conversation concludes with multiple turns for treatment planning. Please note that physicians may only use subgraphs of this general structure, depending also on the patient\u2019s comorbidity, clinical history, and other factors. To gain a deeper understanding of intent trajectories in doctor-patient dialogues and their potential impact on the current state-of-the-art models, we perform an extensive benchmarking and characterization study, which forms our third research contribution. We evaluate generative and encoder-based models on the task of medical intent classification and next intent prediction. Our analysis uncovers key challenges in capturing intent transitions across SOAP categories. Additionally, we identify common physician intent trajectories in doctor-patient dialogues. These trajectories offer valuable insights for the design of dialogue systems to support differential diagnosis. As our final research contribution, we investigate the poten- tial impact on current SOTA models that do not explicitly consider our proposed fine-grained physician intent taxonomy, over a crit- ical, downstream task of dialogue-to-medical-note summarization. We observe that filtering dialogues for physician intents improves summarization quality. We release our dataset2, annotation guide- lines, and code3 to the community to support further research at the intersection of clinical NLP and dialogue-driven clinical decision. 2 Related Work Recent work released medical dialogue corpora to accelerate the development of medical dialogue systems (MDS). We divide these works into two distinct groups. Non-annotated medical dialogues. These datasets do not contain specific dialogue annotations and have either a small number of ex- amples [21], only include short dialogues [2], or are not freely ac- cessible [16, 40, 12, 9]. Larger datasets like [39] are non-English and lack real-world conversations. Annotated medical dialogues. Works such as ReMeDi [35], MIE [42], Code-Mixed [8], IMCS-21 [6], and MediTOD [29] curate re- sources that align with annotations to solve MDS tasks. Such tasks include annotations for medical entity recognition, natural language generation, or dialogue act classification. Our work focuses on a more detailed annotation of physician intents in dialogues guided by the SOAP taxonomy. We use SOAP because it is a widely adopted standard for documenting clinical notes. Therefore, our approach 2 https://huggingface.co/DATEXIS 3 https://github.com/DATEXIS/medical-intent-classification bridges the gap between the representation of patient interactions in dialogues and their documentation in medical notes. Modeling differential diagnosis in medical dialogue systems. Sev- eral studies, including AMIE [31], MEDDxAgent [27], and Kim et al. [15], investigate the application of foundation models in the differential diagnosis process. These works highlight that the initial dialogue phase is the most critical stage, as it shapes the quality and accuracy of subsequent diagnostic reasoning. However, the extent to which these models effectively capture transitions in clinical reason- ing remains an open research question.

    "highlight that the initial dialogue phase is the most critical stage, as it shapes the quality and accuracy of subsequent diagnostic reasoning. However, the extent to which these models effectively capture transitions in clinical reason- ing remains an open research question. Previous studies primarily fo- cus on modeling differential diagnoses or generating physician-like dialogues. In contrast, our work explicitly analyzes physician intent trajectories within medical conversations. We provide a structured framework for understanding how clinicians transition between rea- soning stages in real-time interactions. 3 Medical Intent Dataset In this section, we present the annotation taxonomy, outline the ap- proach used to develop the annotation guidelines, and discuss the in- tent annotation process. Finally, we offer insights into the dynamics of medical dialogues across the SOAP categories. 3.1 Dataset Construction Data pre-processing. We obtain the utterances in our corpus from the role-played medical dialogue dataset Aci-bench [38]. Aci-bench is a dialogue summarization dataset consisting of 207 dialogue- clinical note pairs. We select this dataset for annotation due to its comprehensive collection of doctor-patient dialogues spanning var- ious medical specialties, with an emphasis on authentic clinical in- teractions. Each dialogue is organized with clearly defined speaker roles, and we segment the dialogues into distinct doctor-patient turns according to these roles. We manually revise dialogues containing reversed roles or concatenated utterances to ensure accurate doctor- patient turns. After pre-processing, we end up with 5,541 doctor- patient turns. Intent taxonomy. We design the intent classes to align with the es- tablished Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) [32] taxonomy. Figure 1 shows a comprehensive overview of all intents. This taxonomy allows us to create intents that break down the dia- logues into specific phases that are crucial for the differential diag- nosis process, as we highlight in Figure 2. Figure 3 provides the excerpt of the actual dialogue shown pre- viously in Figure 2. Multiple, short questions by the physician at the beginning of a dialogue characterize the symptom-taking phase (Subjective). We see in Figure 3 that the physician iterates multiple times on Acute Symptoms and asks for the Therapeutic History of the patient. In the examination phase (Objective) the physician collects factual diagnostic observations, such as Physical Examination, Ra- diology Examination, and Lab Examination. The examination phase typically follows the symptom-taking phase and, due to its factual nature, requires less repetition than the symptom-taking phase. The clinical assessment phase (Assessment) involves diagnosing the pa- tient and usually follows the examination phase. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the clinical assessment phase is precise, requiring mostly no repetitions by the physician. Lastly, the dialogue concludes with the treatment-planning phase (Plan), where the physician and patient discuss the proposed treatment plan. As illustrated in",
    "pa- tient and usually follows the examination phase. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the clinical assessment phase is precise, requiring mostly no repetitions by the physician. Lastly, the dialogue concludes with the treatment-planning phase (Plan), where the physician and patient discuss the proposed treatment plan. As illustrated in Figure 2, mul- tiple iterations often occur during this phase. These loops emerge as the patient consents to or engages with the proposed plan. This pro- cess repeats until both parties agree. Annotation guidelines. We collaborate with practicing physicians to develop comprehensive annotation guidelines for physician intent classification. To ensure clarity and consistency, we iteratively refine both the intent taxonomy and the annotation guidelines. Each itera- tion involves an external annotator applying the guidelines to a small subset of the dataset, followed by a critical evaluation of ambiguities, edge cases, and potential refinements. The finalized guidelines con- tain 20 intent classes across 5 categories. For annotation, we adhere to standard practices and initially perform the labeling in-house. Sub- sequently, we verify the accuracy of the annotations with the help of medical professionals through a crowd-sourcing platform [4, 24, 7]. We expand on the annotation process in the supplementary material [28]. Data verification. Medical professionals, recruited through the crowd-sourcing platform Prolific4, verify our annotations to en- sure their reliability. Our effort achieves an annotation accuracy of 81.13%. We systematically review the remaining 19.87% of cases and incorporate annotator feedback, removing samples with unre- solved disagreements. Further details on the verification process are provided in supplementary material [28].

    "alogue with a patient. We show that doctors invest most turns for the symptom-taking phase, with Acute Symptoms being the most fre- quent intent. In contrast, a doctor needs the least turns for the clini- cal assessment phase. While the symptom-taking phase has the most turns on average, the treatment-planning phase can potentially ex- tend over a longer period, as indicated by the maximum number of turns observed across all dialogues in Table 1. This is mainly due to the nature of the treatment-planning phase, which often involves continuous discussions and negotiations between the doctor and pa- tient about treatment options. Such interactions may require multiple iterations before both parties reach a mutual agreement. Doctors speak most during treatment-planning. Although the average number of turns in the treatment-planning phase is lower than in the symptom-taking phase, Table 1 shows that the doctor speaks the most during treatment-planning, as indicated by the mean number of tokens per category. In this phase, Discussion is the most frequent intent. This underscores the difference between the one- sided process of collecting subjective symptoms and the collabora- tive nature of treatment planning. During symptom collection, the doctor primarily collects information by questioning the patient. In contrast, treatment planning involves both the doctor and the patient actively engaging in a dynamic discussion that can evolve without a predetermined outcome. Chitchat in doctor-patient dialogues is omnipresent. On aver- age, a dialogue includes more Chitchat turns than turns in the clin- ical assessment phase. However, despite their frequency, Chitchat turns are brief and can appear in every phase of the dialogue. These turns contain little to no informational content and can be regarded as noise, as they do not aid in the differential diagnosis process. Conclusion. Our findings on the frequency of subjective symptom- taking intents and the omnipresence of chitchat overlap with data statistics published in Yan et al. [35], Saley et al. [29], and Zhang et al. [42]. Similarly to our distribution, we see that the majority of entities are symptom-taking intents and that chitchat is distributed across all dialogues. Since no related work reports utterance length statistics on the intent level, we cannot substantiate our second claim that treatment-planning utterances contain the most words on aver- age. 4 Experimental Setup This section discusses the evaluation tasks and the baseline mod- els used in our experiments. Both tasks are multi-label classifica- tion tasks, and we apply stratified sampling [22] to produce training, validation, and test splits.

To ensure a comprehensive evaluation of our imbalanced dataset, we report both macro-AUROC and macro- Average Precision (AP). While macro-AUROC evaluates classifi- cation performance by measuring the area under the ROC curve, macro-AP provides a more nuanced metric by emphasizing precision and recall, particularly for underrepresented classes. 4.1 Task Definitions Task: Medical intent classification.

The next intent prediction task eval- uates whether a model can predict the subsequent physician intent in the trajectory of a doctor-patient dialogue. Each input consists of up to five preceding doctor-patient turns, and the model is tasked with predicting one or more intents associated with the next step of the physician in the sequence. For cases where the prediction involves the first turn in the dialogue, we prepend a fixed Conversation Start token to represent the absence of prior context.

Encoder models. We select state-of-the-art clinical encoder mod- els GatorTronS [37, 5] and BiomedBERT [14, 26] and fine-tune them in two settings. The first setting is fine-tuning on the intent classes only, whereas the second setting is a hierarchical fine-tuning. In the hierarchical approach, the model first predicts the SOAP categories and then the intent classes. We mask intents that do not associate to the predicted SOAP categories from the first step and calculate a loss as an average of both steps. The optimizer is AdamW [19]. Decoder-only models. Due to their reasonable size and state- of-the-art performance we evaluate Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct [13], Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct [36], and Phi-4-14B [1]. In order to adapt au- toregressive models to classification tasks, we employ guided de- coding and follow Willard and Louf [33]. We enforce the models to always generate an output that contains all classes paired with a boolean value that indicates the presence or absence of the class in the current utterance. Thus, we can replicate a discrete prediction space and apply classification metrics without the need for sophisti- cated post-processing of the output. We refrain from training the decoder-only models and instead eval- uate them at inference time in both zero-shot and few-shot settings.",

We refrain from training the decoder-only models and instead eval- uate them at inference time in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. In the zero-shot setting, we provide only a simple prompt that instructs the model to classify the current sample. For the few-shot setting, we additionally include (x, y) examples in the prompt. We retrieve relevant examples by computing the BM25 [25] score between the input x and an example corpus C, where C comprises all samples from the training and validation splits. In few-shot experiments, we incorporate the top three retrieved examples. We provide a prompt example in the supplementary material [28]. 5 Experimental Results and Discussion We present results for all models on both tasks in Table 4 and ana- lyze the intent-wise performance of the best-performing model. Fur- thermore, we conduct an ablation study with a fine-tuned next intent prediction model to reconstruct dialogue sequences. 5.1 Experimental Results Intent classification. Fine-tuned encoder-based models consis- tently outperform all decoder-only models by at least 70.58% Av- erage Precision (AP). GatorTronS achieves the highest performance, Table 4: Experimental results for all models on both tasks. We report AUROC and Average Precision (AP) macro averaged. \u00b1 denotes the standard deviation before aggregation. Fine-tuning encoder models performs significantly better than decoder-only models.

The next intent prediction task yields re- sults similar to those seen in the intent classification task. As in the intent classification task, decoder-only models cannot match the per- formance of the fine-tuned encoder models, with a difference of at least 29.78% AP. In this task, hierarchical fine-tuning degrades the performance of the encoder models in both metrics by a large margin. We observe, that AP for GatorTronS drops by 114.89%. Phi-4 and Qwen2.5 exhibit identical performance, with Llama3.1 trailing be- hind. Notably, the decoder-only models do not benefit as much from additional examples as in the prior task.

Notably, the decoder-only models do not benefit as much from additional examples as in the prior task. For Phi-4, the AP difference between zero-shot and few-shot is only 13.33%. The AUROC per- formance of Qwen2.5 in the few-shot setting is even lower than in the zero-shot setting, suggesting that intent trajectories can vary signifi- cantly. Providing similar examples may cause confusion rather than offering meaningful support. 5.2 Intent Performance Analysis Tasks differences in robustness towards intent imbalance. Table 4 highlights a discrepancy between AUROC and AP for all models in both tasks. Although the model performs well on average, clas- sification accuracy decreases across the different intents, indicating reduced performance for less frequent or more challenging intent cat- egories. Figure 4 shows the AUROC and AP scores for both tasks per intent, as well as their frequency in the data. In the figure, we order the intents according to the SOAP categories, starting with Subjec- tive intents on the left, moving through Objective and Assessment, and ending with Plan intents. Chitchat intents are placed on the far right. Our results demonstrate that the frequency of intents has a negli- gible effect on the AP for the intent classification task. However, we observe a clear correlation between AP and intent frequency in the next intent prediction task. This indicates that intent classification is more resilient to intent imbalance, while next intent prediction is significantly affected by this imbalance. We explain this divergent behavior with the complexity of task input. In intent classification, the model only classifies a single utterance, making it less sensitive to intent imbalance. In contrast, next intent prediction requires the model to understand a trajectory of doctor-patient turns, where intent sequences can vary. This variability means the model needs more ex- amples to effectively capture the potential intent combinations, mak- ing it more susceptible to class imbalance. Semantic similarities impact intent classification. The Lab Ex- amination intent has the lowest AP (0.21) in the intent classification task. In contrast, the other two Objective intents, Physical Exami- nation and Radiology Examination, achieve significantly higher AP scores of 0.86 and 0.80, respectively. The Lab Examination intent and Radiology Examination intent share similar semantic structures, since both involve the examination of diagnostic tests. A closer look into the results reveals that the model misclassifies Lab Examina- tion instances as Radiology Examination and Physical Examination. This indicates that the model learns to identify the presence of diag- nostic tests, but does not distinguish the subtle differences between certain types of tests. However, in the next intent prediction",
    "into the results reveals that the model misclassifies Lab Examina- tion instances as Radiology Examination and Physical Examination. This indicates that the model learns to identify the presence of diag- nostic tests, but does not distinguish the subtle differences between certain types of tests. However, in the next intent prediction task, we do not observe such behavior. The different behavior signifies that the two tasks learn to represent the same intents differently. Thus, each task poses distinct challenges, even though they share the same intent classes. 5.3 Error Analysis and Reconstructing Dialogue Sequences We do not present the models with a complete dialogue during the next intent prediction training. However, the ability to compre- hend and plan dialogues is essential for models designed to sup- port doctors throughout the differential diagnosis process. To inves- tigate whether a model fine-tuned on next intent prediction retains these characteristics, we evaluate its ability to reconstruct dialogue sequences. Dialogue type impacts reconstruction accuracy. The cause of a patient visiting a doctor determines the type of interview they con- duct. We categorized the interviews into two types: linear and non- linear. A dialogue structure is considered linear when the patient presents a common complaint that follows standard examination pat- terns. These patterns are characterized by distinct transitions across the SOAP phases as detailed in Section 3.1. Cases such as follow-ups or annual exams dialogues are non-linear, as the transitions through the SOAP phases do not follow standard patterns. We show exam- ples of sequences for both types of dialogue in Figure 5. In the lin- ear dialogue, we observe that after 14 turns in the symptom-taking phase (Subjective), the physician transitions to the examination phase (Objective), followed by the clinical assessment phase (Assessment) and several turns dedicated to the treatment-planning phase (Plan). The conversation ends with some Chitchat. As for the non-linear dia- logue, we do not have distinct transitions between the SOAP phases. In turns 9 and 11, the doctor initiates a clinical assessment phase that does not lead to the treatment-planning phase, but to a symptom- taking phase. We observe the same for the examination phase. The doctor examines the patient in between the symptom-taking phase instead of conducting the examinations in a coherent sequence of turns. In summary, the model can reconstruct the sequence of linear di- alogues. However, the model fails to predict anomalies for the non- linear dialogue. Instead, it defaults to predicting a linear trajectory. Model overconfidence limits precision. We show additional ex- amples of reconstructed sequences in Figure 5. Specifically, we show a comparison between a high-scoring sequence and a low-scoring se- quence in terms of average precision. In both examples, we see that the model predicts more",

In all cases, the model can replicate the sequence to some extent but fails to reconstruct non-linear sequences. We identify model confidence and phase transitions as major challenges. data. Furthermore, the model has a tendency to continue sequences as Chitchat. Model does not learn phase transitions. In all the examples shown in Figure 5, the model does not predict the phase transitions in the correct turns. We identify two transition error classes. The first one is that the model predicts a transition one turn too late. This in- dicates that the model depends on the content of the previous turns to change phases rather than on learned trajectories. The second er- ror class is a premature transition by the model, especially present in phase transitions from Subjective to Objective. Despite the fact that the doctor has not concluded the symptom-taking phase, the model wants to transition to the objective examination phase after 9 turns. 6 Impact of Intent Classification on Medical Dialogue Summarization To evaluate the effectiveness of models trained on our intent classi- fication dataset, we integrate them into downstream summarization tasks as outlined in Yim et al. [38]. We test on all five summarization tasks: full note, subjective, objective exam, objective results, and as- sessment and plan. Each task takes a doctor-patient dialogue as input and generates a medical note. For instance, in the subjective task, we only summarize the subjective findings of the patient, whereas in the assessment and plan task, we summarize the diagnosis and treatment plans. Proposed methodology. A fine-tuned intent classification model filters the input dialogue before summarization; we use the best per- forming GatorTronS from Section 5. The filter removes non-medical utterances or retains those relevant to the specific note categories.",
    "in the assessment and plan task, we summarize the diagnosis and treatment plans. Proposed methodology. A fine-tuned intent classification model filters the input dialogue before summarization; we use the best per- forming GatorTronS from Section 5. The filter removes non-medical utterances or retains those relevant to the specific note categories. For full-note summarization, we discard utterances classified as Chitchat and retain all others. In subjective summarization, only Subjective utterances are kept. Objective exam summarization includes Objec- tive category utterances with a Physical Examination intent. Objec- tive results summarization also retains Objective category utterances but requires the Lab Examination and/or the Radiology Examination intent. Finally, the assessment and plan summarization keeps only utterances from the Assessment or Plan categories. Experimental setup. We fine-tune a BART-large [17] using the hyperparameters from Yim et al. [38] and employ the same decoder- only models as in the intent classification experiments, with the addi- tion of GPT-4o. For decoder-only models, we set the temperature to 0.2 and limit new tokens to 512 for full-note summarization and 256 for section-level summarization. We infer them in a zero-shot and few-shot setting, with BM25 as the candidate retriever and 3 candi- dates per sample. Additional candidates consist of dialogue and sum- mary. Performance is reported using F1-macro for Rouge-1, Rouge- 2, Rouge-Lsum [18], Medcon [30], BERTScore [41], and the average for all metrics. Experimental results. We report in Table 5 results only for the BART model and the best-performing model per task. We provide the full result tables in the supplementary materials. Decoder-only mod- els in the few-shot setting consistently achieve the highest scores, outperforming the zero-shot setting averaged across all tasks by 28.93% and the fine-tuned BART by 63.17%. The significant perfor- mance gap between the decoder-only models and BART is twofold. First, the training data consists of too few samples and too much variance; consequently, the training signal is too coarse for effective fine-tuning. Second, the average dialogue length in Aci-bench ex- ceeds the 1024 maximum input length of BART; thus, the model has to truncate the input and omit information. Filtering generally im- proves the performance of decoder-only models by 5.39%. The filter significantly decreases the performance for BART in full-note and subjective summarization by 21.05% and 50%, respectively, but im- proves the decoder-only models in those tasks by 1.63% and 10%. The largest improvement occurs in objective exam summarization with an increase of 72.22% for BART and 15.38% for the decoder- only model. Experimental results.

We provide exam- ples in the supplementary material. \u2022 Reduction of verbosity in summaries. Since we exclude un- wanted information in the dialogue and reduce noise in the input, the filter reduces the verbosity of the generated notes in all sum- marization tasks. We observe the greatest impact on the objective exam task. In this task, we summarize the Physical Examination (PE) findings and notes are usually very short. In addition, we see improvements in full-note summarization for chitchat-heavy dia- logues. \u2022 Utterance complexity determines filtered dialogue density.

The same applies to PE utterances in the objective exam summariza- tion, where we observe significant improvements. Improvement in assessment and plan summarization is only marginal, because the corresponding utterances are long and with overlapping intents. The filter does not dissect these utterances for the important in- formation. Noise persists in the input dialogue and reduces the potential summarization quality. \u2022 Information loss due to incorrect classification. The filtering model occasionally misclassifies utterances, leading to the omis- sion of relevant information. In such cases, the filtered input di- alogues are incomplete, and the summaries perform worse than their unfiltered counterparts. The objective results summarization highlights this behavior. This category focuses on Radiology- and Lab Examination (LE) utterances. As discussed in Section 5.2, the model has a tendency to misclassify LE utterances as Physical Examination (PE). Since we filter PE utterances for this category, we lose valuable information and score worse than the unfiltered summarization. In summary, filtering improves performance, particularly for SOAP category-specific summarization, by creating dense input dia- logues, which reduces the verbosity in the summary. We see that this works well for categories in which utterances are less complex, but not as well for categories with more complex utterances. However, incorrect classification can significantly degrade performance if key utterances are excluded from the input dialogue. 7 Conclusion In this work, we present \"Where does it hurt?\" - a novel medical in- tent classification dataset for dialogues. We introduce the complete annotation process and describe the taxonomy based on the SOAP framework. This adaptation of the SOAP framework for dialogues allows us to conclude that physicians spend the most turns on sub- jective symptom-taking, but talk the most during treatment-planning. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experimental studies on an in- tent classification task and a next intent prediction task. We show that classically fine-tuned encoder-only models perform best in both tasks. Language models learn to classify doctor utterances to medical intents but struggle to predict the next intent for a sequence of doctor- patient turns. We examine the robustness of medical intent classi- fication models towards class imbalance and present challenges in reconstructing dialogue trajectories with next intent prediction mod- els. Lastly, we utilize a model trained on our dataset as a filter in a downstream summarization task and show improved summarization performance against baselines. Future Work. First, the dialogue reconstruction experiment in Section 5.3 shows that the models learn to follow trajectories but fail to identify category transitions. Further investigation to improve transition capabilities can lead to better overall reconstruction qual- ity. Second, the findings that we acquire on",

First, the dialogue reconstruction experiment in Section 5.3 shows that the models learn to follow trajectories but fail to identify category transitions. Further investigation to improve transition capabilities can lead to better overall reconstruction qual- ity. Second, the findings that we acquire on physician behavior dur- ing dialogues and common intent trajectories can be utilized to cre- ate more sophisticated dialogue generation methods, especially in the context of medical note-to-dialogue transcription. Limitations. First, we source the dialogues for the annotation from the popular Aci-bench benchmark dataset [38], where the dialogues are role-played and thus do not need further de-identification, and as such may not properly reflect a real-world scenario. Second, we fine-tune the encoder models in our experiments, but do not fine-tune the decoder-only models because of computational and budget con- straints. Therefore, the performance comparison may unfairly favor the encoder models. Acknowledgements We would like to thank the reviewers for their helpful suggestions and comments.

    "HIPLAN: Hierarchical Planning for LLM Agents with Adaptive Global-Local Guidance Ziyue Li1,2, Yuan Chang1,2, Gaihong Yu1*, Xiaoqiu Le1,2* 1National Science Library, Chinese Academy of Sciences 2Department of Information Resources Management, School of Economics and Management, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences {liziyue, changyuan, yugh, lexq}@mail.las.ac.cn Abstract Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demon- strated remarkable capabilities in decision-making tasks, but struggle significantly with complex, long-horizon planning scenarios. This arises from their lack of macroscopic guid- ance, causing disorientation and failures in complex tasks, as well as insufficient continuous oversight during execution, rendering them unresponsive to environmental changes and prone to deviations. To tackle these challenges, we introduce HIPLAN, a hierarchical planning framework that provides adaptive global-local guidance to boost LLM-based agents\u2019 decision-making. HIPLAN decomposes complex tasks into milestone action guides for general direction and step-wise hints for detailed actions. During the offline phase, we con- struct a milestone library from expert demonstrations, en- abling structured experience reuse by retrieving semantically similar tasks and milestones. In the execution phase, trajec- tory segments from past milestones are dynamically adapted to generate step-wise hints that align current observations with the milestone objectives, bridging gaps and correct- ing deviations. Extensive experiments across two challenging benchmarks demonstrate that HIPLAN substantially outper- forms strong baselines, and ablation studies validate the com- plementary benefits of its hierarchical components. 1 Introduction Large language model (LLM)-based agents have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a wide range of decision-making and reasoning tasks(Durante et al. 2024; Xi et al. 2025; Wang et al. 2024; Huang et al. 2024). Their proficiency in understanding complex instructions and gen- erating coherent, context-aware responses has enabled the automation of various applications. Despite these advances, enabling LLM-based agents to effectively plan and act over long horizons remains a fundamental challenge, especially given the complexity of real-world tasks and the dynamic nature of environments. Existing research has approached these challenges from two main perspectives. High-level planning methods (Khot et al. 2023; Wang et al. 2023) allow agents to decompose tasks into subgoals, providing clear overall direction and guiding the agent\u2019s progress toward fulfilling the final objec- tives. However, such methods often exhibit limited flexibil- ity in handling unexpected execution errors or dynamically *Corresponding Author adapting actions when the environment changes (see Fig.1; Top-Left). Furthermore, these methods often rely on com- plete historical trajectories of specific tasks as demonstra- tions, which introduces excessive task-specific details that hinder generalization and reduce robustness in new scenar- ios. Step-wise methods (Yao et al. 2023b; Zhou et al. 2024) excel at adapting actions to real-time observations. How- ever, this finer-grained focus frequently leads the agent to lose sight of the overall task structure, making it prone to inefficient or locally optimal behaviors\u2014especially",
    "and reduce robustness in new scenar- ios. Step-wise methods (Yao et al. 2023b; Zhou et al. 2024) excel at adapting actions to real-time observations. How- ever, this finer-grained focus frequently leads the agent to lose sight of the overall task structure, making it prone to inefficient or locally optimal behaviors\u2014especially in long- horizon or unfamiliar tasks (see Fig.1; Top-Right). More- over, step-wise methods often struggle to effectively reuse prior experience beyond immediate observations, hindering their scalability and adaptability in diverse tasks. To overcome existing limitations, we propose HIPLAN, a hierarchical planning framework that endows LLM-based agents with adaptive global-local guidance (see Fig.1; Bot- tom). At the macro level, HIPLAN employs a milestone ac- tion guide as a \u2019roadmap\u2019 delineating critical task stages to maintain global direction and avoid local optima, while at the micro level, step-wise hints act like real-time \u2019traffic updates\u2019, providing fine-grained feedback to correct actions and align progress with current milestones. This synergy en- hances efficiency, controllability, and overall robustness. A core innovation of HIPLAN is its effective reuse of his- torical experience through a milestone library constructed offline from expert demonstrations. During execution, this library guides the generation of the high-level milestone ac- tion guide, enabling the agent to learn from prior experience at a macro scale. For the step-wise hint generation, HIPLAN retrieves trajectory fragments corresponding to similar com- pleted milestones, providing fine-grained, context-relevant guidance. We select milestone-level experience for reuse be- cause action-level trajectories are often too dependent on specific contexts to offer useful information, while task-level trajectories include excessive details that introduce noise. Positioned between these two, milestone-level trajectories serve as ideal units of intermediate granularity, balancing in- formativeness and generalizability for effective retrieval and planning. We evaluate HIPLAN on two challenging benchmarks, ALFWorld (Shridhar et al. 2021) and WebShop (Yao et al. 2022), featuring complex long-horizon tasks. Results show HIPLAN consistently outperforms strong baselines with arXiv:2508.19076v1 [cs.CL] 26 Aug 2025 Figure 1: Top-Left: High-level planning with global sub- goals lacking flexibility; Top-Right: Step-wise methods with local adaptability but limited global guidance; Bottom: HIPLAN\u2019s hierarchical approach combining milestone guid- ance and step-wise hints for adaptive and robust planning. higher success rates and greater robustness.

Build- ing on these core competencies, recent advancements have extended their application to more challenging scenarios, where LLM-based agents exhibit promising potential in au- tonomous decision-making and planning. Current planning approaches for LLM-based agents can be broadly categorized into two primary paradigms. High- level planning methods (Erdogan et al. 2025; Sun et al. 2024; Wang et al. 2023; Khot et al. 2023) focus on decomposing complex tasks into structured subgoals or generating com- prehensive plans before execution. These approaches pro- vide clear overall direction and maintain global coherence throughout task execution. However, such methods often ex- hibit limited flexibility when encountering unexpected exe- cution errors or adapting to dynamic environmental changes. Step-wise planning methods (Yao et al. 2023b; Zhou et al. 2024; Nguyen and Shareghi 2024) excel at real-time adapta- tion by interleaving reasoning and action steps. These meth- ods enable agents to adjust their strategies based on immedi- ate observations and environmental feedback, making them highly responsive to changing conditions. Nevertheless, this fine-grained focus frequently leads agents to lose sight of the overall task structure, resulting in inefficient exploration or locally optimal behaviors, particularly in long-horizon sce- narios. Additional representative approaches encompass memory-augmented systems (Zhao et al. 2024; Hu et al. 2024) that leverage historical experiences for improved decision-making, and reflection-based frameworks (Shinn et al. 2023) that enable agents to learn from failures through self-critique and iterative improvement. Despite these advances, existing methods face fundamen- tal limitations in achieving both global coherence and local adaptability simultaneously. Our work addresses this by in- tegrating global milestone action guides with local step-wise hints, enabling adaptive global-local guidance for enhanced efficiency and robustness in long-horizon tasks. 2.2 Retrieval-Augmented Planning Retrieval-augmented planning (RAP) methods en- hance LLM-based agents by retrieving past experi- ences\u2014trajectories, plans, or instruction graphs\u2014to ground planning in real execution data.

One approach retrieves relevant exemplars or context fragments conditioned on task similarity, enabling improved planning in both text-only and multimodal environments (Liu et al. 2022; Trivedi et al. 2023; Zhou et al. 2024). A second strand organizes retrieval around abstract, struc- tured representations\u2014such as instruction graphs\u2014to im- prove transferability and generalization (Kim et al. 2024; Wang et al. 2025). Despite their strength, existing RAP approaches often rely heavily on full exemplar retrieval, which can introduce noise and limit flexibility. They also typically decouple global planning from local adaptability. In contrast, HIPLAN in- tegrates task-level and milestone-level retrieval, which en- ables robust, structured guidance that retains adaptability to execution context\u2014addressing both generalization and dy- namic control more effectively than prior RAP methods.

The environment is formalized as a par- tially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), rep- resented as M = (S, A, O, T), where S denotes the set of latent environment states, A the discrete action space, O the observation space, and T : S \u00d7 A \u2192S the transition func- tion. At the beginning of each episode, the agent is provided with a task instruction \u03c4 \u2208T , expressed in natural language. Over a sequence of steps t = 1, 2, . . . , T, the agent receives observations ot \u2208O and selects actions at \u2208A, aiming to reach a successful terminal state that satisfies \u03c4, despite partial observability and complex dynamics. 4 Method We propose HIPLAN, a hierarchical planning framework that equips LLM-based agents with adaptive global-local guidance for tackling long-horizon tasks. 4.1 Overview Fig. 2 illustrates the overall architecture and workflow of HIPLAN. Our method decomposes complex tasks into a se- quence of critical milestones forming a high-level action guide, while progressively generating fine-grained step-wise hints to refine each action based on real-time observations. To facilitate structured planning and control, we as- sume access to a set of successful task demonstrations D = {(\u03c4 (i), \u03be(i))}N i=1, where each trajectory \u03be(i) = h (o(i) 1 , a(i) 1 ), . . . , (o(i) T (i), a(i) T (i)) i corresponds to a task \u03c4 (i). From these demonstrations, HIPLAN constructs a milestone library and retrieves structured experience during execution. We introduce two complementary forms of guidance for hierarchical planning: \u2022 Global Guidance: A milestone action guide G\u03c4 = [m1, m2, . . . , mK], where each mk is a natural language subgoal that represents a critical stage in completing the task. This sequence provides a high-level plan structure",
    "We introduce two complementary forms of guidance for hierarchical planning: \u2022 Global Guidance: A milestone action guide G\u03c4 = [m1, m2, . . . , mK], where each mk is a natural language subgoal that represents a critical stage in completing the task. This sequence provides a high-level plan structure which serves as the coarse-grained directional guidance. \u2022 Local Guidance: A step-wise hint ht, generated at each timestep by retrieving trajectory fragments that corre- spond to the current milestone. This hint offers fine- grained behavioral suggestions conditioned on the cur- rent observation and subgoal. The agent\u2019s policy \u03c0 : (\u03c4, ot, G\u03c4, ht) \u2192at integrates both levels of guidance to produce context-aware, goal-directed actions. The combination of a global roadmap and local- ized hint and retrieval enables robust and efficient decision- making in complex long-horizon tasks. 4.2 Offline Phase: Milestone Library Construction HIPLAN constructs a milestone library ML from the set of successful demonstrations D = {(\u03c4 (i), \u03be(i))}N i=1. For each trajectory \u03be(\u27e9), we segment it into K(i) contiguous fragments {\u03b6(i) k }K(i) k=1 , each corresponding to a semantically meaningful subgoal. An LLM is prompted to generate a nat- ural language description m(i) k for each segment, forming a milestone sequence G\u03c4 (i) = [m(i) 1 , . . . , m(i) K(i)]. To support efficient retrieval, each instruction and mile- stone is embedded into a dense vector space. The milestone library stores tuples of the form: (v(i) task, v(i,k) milestone, \u03c4 (i), m(i) k , \u03b6(i) k ), where v(i) task and v(i,k) milestone are vector representations for the task \u03c4 (i) and the milestone m(i) k , respectively. Similarity is computed via dot product over normalized embeddings. The final milestone library is defined as: ML = N [ i=1 K(i) [ k=1 n (v(i) task, v(i,k) milestone, m(i) k , \u03b6(i) k ) o . The milestone library abstracts higher-level structured ex- periences while preserving task-specific low-level details. Compared to raw trajectory or task-level retrieval, this mid- granularity representation provides a balanced trade-off be- tween generalizability and specificity, making it ideal for hi- erarchical planning under varied conditions. 4.3 Execution Phase: Hierarchical Planning and Execution In the execution phase, HIPLAN performs hierarchical plan- ning by dynamically integrating global milestone guidance and fine-grained step-wise hints. Leveraging structured ex- periences from the milestone library, our framework pro- vides an adaptive planning mechanism that maintains global consistency and facilitates local flexibility, as illustrated in Fig. 2. We assume this dual-level approach can help mit- igate common issues in long-horizon task execution, such as deviation from global objectives and inability to adapt to real-time uncertainties.

    "local flexibility, as illustrated in Fig. 2. We assume this dual-level approach can help mit- igate common issues in long-horizon task execution, such as deviation from global objectives and inability to adapt to real-time uncertainties. Global Guidance: Milestone Action Guide To estab- lish strategic direction for long-horizon task completion, HIPLAN provides global guidance through a dynamically generated milestone action guide. Given a test-time task in- struction \u03c4, HIPLAN retrieves similar task entries from the milestone library using the embedding of \u03c4 as the query key: {(\u03c4 (j), \u03be(j), G\u03c4 (j))}M j=1 = Retrieve(v\u03c4) (1) These entries include task instructions, trajectories, and corresponding milestone sequences, which serve as refer- ences to generate a tailored guide: G\u03c4 = LLM(\u03c4, {(\u03c4 (j), \u03be(j), G\u03c4 (j))}M j=1), (2) where G\u03c4 = [m1, m2, . . . , mK] and each mk is a critical subgoal adapted to the current task context. This process aims to transfer insights from historical ex- periences, enabling the agent to benefit from past successful planning strategies while maintaining flexibility to handle new task dynamics. Figure 2: The HIPLAN framework. In the offline phase (top left), a milestone library is constructed from expert demonstrations. During online execution (right), the agent utilizes this library by retrieving relevant task and milestone-level experiences to generate a global Milestone Action Guide and local Step-Wise Hints, enabling adaptive planning. Local Guidance: Step-Wise Hints Complementing the global milestone structure, HIPLAN provides detailed lo- cal guidance through context-awareness step-wise hints, dy- namically generated at each step. At timestep t, the cur- rent milestone m\u03c8(t) is identified, and its embedding vm\u03c8(t) serves as the query key to retrieve similar milestones and their corresponding trajectory segments from the milestone library: {(m\u2217 l , \u03b6\u2217 l )}P l=1 = Retrieve(vm\u03c8(t)), (3) where m\u2217 l and \u03b6\u2217 l denote retrieved milestones and the tra- jectory segments that complete them, respectively. These re- trieved elements are then used as references, combined with past action-observation pairs {(os, as)}t s=1, to generate the step-wise hint ht: ht = LLM(mk, {(os, as)}t s=1, {(m\u2217 l , \u03b6\u2217 l )}P l=1). (4) Each hint explicitly highlights the current state context, the gap to the milestone, and, when necessary, corrections to the agent\u2019s intended actions, thus providing immediate feed- back to rectify errors or inefficiencies: ht = {State Context, Milestone Gap, Action Correction}. The step-wise hints dynamically track the agent\u2019s progres- sion, recognizing when milestone subgoals are achieved and seamlessly guiding the agent toward subsequent objectives. Dual-level Guidance Enhanced Policy At each timestep t, the agent leverages the milestone action guide to maintain global task coherence, while simultaneously utilizing step- wise hints to adaptively transition between milestones based on real-time observations.

Dual-level Guidance Enhanced Policy At each timestep t, the agent leverages the milestone action guide to maintain global task coherence, while simultaneously utilizing step- wise hints to adaptively transition between milestones based on real-time observations. Formally, the integrated policy \u03c0 combines these two complementary sources of guidance as: at = \u03c0(\u03c4, {(os, as)}t s=1, mk, ht) (5) In this formulation, HIPLAN performs adaptive hierarchi- cal planning by closely integrating the global milestone ac- tion guide with dynamic local step-wise hints. The detailed algorithmic workflow is presented in Alg. 1. 5 Experiment 5.1 Experimental Setup Datasets We evaluate HIPLAN on two widely used bench- marks for long-horizon decision-making: ALFWorld (Shridhar et al. 2021) is a text-based bench- mark that challenges an agent\u2019s ability to perform complex, multi-step tasks in a simulated household environment. The benchmark comprises six distinct task types: Pick & Place, Pick Two & Place, Examine in Light, Clean & Place, Heat & Place, and Cool & Place, testing an agent\u2019s capacity for understanding object states and interactions, and executing long action sequences that can exceed 50 steps.

WebShop (Yao et al. 2022) is a large-scale interactive en- vironment that simulates an online shopping website with over 1.18 million products. It tests an agent\u2019s ability to ground natural language instructions into a sequence of search and click actions to purchase a specific product. We evaluate HIPLAN on a set of 200 test instructions, report- ing the average reward, which reflects the degree of attribute alignment with the request, and the success rate, which mea- sures the fraction of tasks where all specifications are satis- fied perfectly. Implementation Details To construct the milestone library, we collect successful expert trajectories from both ALFWorld and WebShop. Each trajectory is segmented into key milestones using GPT-4o (gpt-4o-2024-08-06). Task instructions and extracted milestone descriptions are encoded using the SentenceTransformers model all-mpnet-base-v2, and indexed via inner-product similarity for efficient retrieval. All components of HIPLAN\u2014including milestone ac- tion guide generation, step-wise hint construction, and fi- nal action prediction\u2014are executed by the same underlying LLM. We evaluate the framework using two open-source models: Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1 (denoted as Mixtral) and LLaMA-3.3-70B-Instruct (denoted as LLaMA). These two represent distinct model architec- tures: Mixtral is a sparse mixture-of-experts (SMoE) model, while LLaMA is a dense",

We evaluate the framework using two open-source models: Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1 (denoted as Mixtral) and LLaMA-3.3-70B-Instruct (denoted as LLaMA). These two represent distinct model architec- tures: Mixtral is a sparse mixture-of-experts (SMoE) model, while LLaMA is a dense pre-trained LLM. This choice allows us to assess HIPLAN\u2019s generality across different model types while ensuring reproducibility. In line with prior work, we limit each episode to at most 50 steps in ALFWorld and 40 steps in WebShop. All outputs from LLMs are generated deterministically with tempera- ture set to 0.0 to ensure consistent and reproducible results. Baselines We compare HIPLAN against three strong LLM-based planning baselines, each representative of a dis- tinct approach to decision-making: REACT (Yao et al. 2023b) exemplifies classical planning-style methods, where reasoning and acting are in- terleaved through chain-of-thought prompting and action generation. It enables the agent to maintain high-level plans, update them on the fly, and interface with the environment in a structured manner. Reflexion (Shinn et al. 2023) represents the class of reflection-driven methods. Instead of parameter updates, it leverages self-generated linguistic feedback to iteratively improve performance across episodes. The agent reflects on past outcomes, maintains episodic memory, and refines its behavior through natural language reasoning. TRAD (Zhou et al. 2024) is a retrieval-augmented method that improves in-context decision-making by select- ing trajectory segments based on thought-level similarity. By aligning these fragments and filtering irrelevant context, TRAD enables agents to draw more directly on prior demon- strations. All baselines are evaluated under the same conditions as HIPLAN, using identical environments and LLM backbones to ensure a fair comparison. Implementation details for all baselines are provided in Appendix. 5.2 Main Results We summarize our experimental results in Tables 1 and 2, showing that HIPLAN consistently outperforms all baseline methods across both ALFWorld and WebShop benchmarks. We discuss these results in detail below. ALFWorld HIPLAN achieves the highest success rates across all task categories, demonstrating substantial im- provements over baselines with absolute gains ranging from 4% to 23% points for Mixtral and 15% to 44% points for LLaMA. While Reflexion method enables agent to reflect on failed trials and retry, its reliance on episode-level feedback makes it struggle to escape similar error patterns, resulting in only marginal improvements over REACT. HIPLAN also surpasses the strong retrieval-based TRAD baseline, which only supplies action-level demonstrations without higher- level goal structure and can introduce noise that misleads the agent.

WebShop Results shown in Table 2 reveals a similar trend, with HIPLAN achieving the highest success rates of 36% (Mixtral) and 40% (LLaMA), outperforming baselines by up to 32% absolute points. All baseline methods perform poorly on this environment. Interestingly, TRAD shows in- consistent performance, even underperforming REACT and Reflexion on the Mixtral. This suggests that in WebShop en- vironment, directly providing low-level action demonstra- tions as in-context examples can often introduce significant noise, severely misguiding the agent and preventing target product purchase within limited steps. This also indicat- ing the sensitivity of TRAD to different task characteristics. HIPLAN achieves consistent and substantial improvements in both average task reward (measuring attribute alignment of purchased products) and overall success rate. The su- perior task reward indicates that even when HIPLAN fails to find the exact target product, it can identifies alternative products that better satisfy the specified constraints, guided by the synergy between high-level and step-wise signals. Overall, these experimental results highlight the effec- tiveness of HIPLAN\u2019s hierarchical guidance mechanism. By leveraging structured milestone-level plans and providing dynamic global-local integration, HIPLAN significantly en- hances the performance of LLM-based agents in complex, long-horizon tasks. Its robust performance across different environments and model architectures underscores the gen- erality and adaptability of our approach. 5.3 Ablation Studies To assess the contribution of the core mechanisms in HIPLAN, we conduct ablation studies across two environ- ments by evaluating three variants: \u2022 HIPLAN-Direct: Removes both the milestone action guide and step-wise hints, relying solely on direct ac- tion generation from task instructions, task-level similar demonstrations and observations. \u2022 HIPLAN-Milestone: Retains only the high-level",

The results in Fig. 3 demonstrate that all variants under- perform HIPLAN across environments and LLMs, which highlight several key findings: Hierarchical Guidance is Crucial. While HIPLAN- Milestone provides modest improvements over the direct setting, the combination with step-wise hints yields sub- stantial gains (11-32% points in ALFWorld, 9-11% points in WebShop). These results validate the synergy effect of HIPLAN\u2019s dual-level guidance. Milestone Demonstrations Enhance Planning Quality. HIPLAN-w/o milestone-level demonstrations shows consis- tent performance drops. This validates the effect of leverag- ing milestone-level similar experiences from the milestone library rather than providing step-wise hints from scratch. Robust Generalizability. The performance gains from HIPLAN are consistent across both ALFWorld and Web- Shop, despite their distinct characteristics\u2014text-based Figure 3: Ablation study results across ALFWorld and Web- Shop with Mixtral and LLaMA. HIPLAN consistently out- performs all ablated variants, validating the importance of hierarchical guidance and the reuse of milestone-level demonstrations. household versus web navigation. Both LLMs exhibit con- sistent cumulative effects from the components. This sug- gests that the benefits of hierarchical guidance and experi- ences reuse generalize across different scenarios and LLMs. 5.4 Case Study To better understand how HIPLAN enables adaptive hierar- chical planning, we present a case study on the ALFWorld task: \u201cput two soapbar in garbagecan\u201d. This task involves locating and manipulating multiple objects sequentially in a partially observable environment, making it a challenging scenario in this environment. As shown in Fig. 4, HIPLAN initially generates a global Milestone Action Guide that decomposes the task into eight sequential and interconnected subgoals, spanning from lo- cating the first soapbar through to disposing of the second one. During execution, HIPLAN leverages local Step-Wise Hints to guide the agent through each subgoal. The hints are dynamically generated by LLM from prior milestone-level experience, enabling the agent to: \u2022 Adaptively switch milestones when preceding mile- stones are achieved, directing attention to the subse- quent milestone (e.g., shifting the objective from \u201cPick up soapbar\u201d to \u201cGo to garbagecan\u201d after an item is ac- quired). \u2022 Narrow milestone gaps by retrieving action sequences from similar past milestones as references and analyzes the gap between the agent\u2019s current state and the mile- stone\u2019s objective to infer the",
    "milestone (e.g., shifting the objective from \u201cPick up soapbar\u201d to \u201cGo to garbagecan\u201d after an item is ac- quired). \u2022 Narrow milestone gaps by retrieving action sequences from similar past milestones as references and analyzes the gap between the agent\u2019s current state and the mile- stone\u2019s objective to infer the most plausible next action. \u2022 Recall relevant memory by injecting contextual infor- mation into the hint. For long-horizon tasks, this allows the agent to reuse prior knowledge established in earlier steps (e.g., re-visiting a known soapbar location), thus maintaining context and avoiding redundant actions. \u2022 Correct errors by detecting deviations from expected progress (e.g., attempting to drop an item before reach- ing the garbagecan) and injecting targeted corrections in the hint. Figure 4: Illustration of HIPLAN\u2019s hierarchical guidance in the \u201cput two soapbar in garbagecan\u201d task. The diagram high- lights milestone transitions (M), gap narrowing, and error correction via adaptive hints. Compared to flat structure baselines like REACT or TRAD, which may lack phased goal guidance and step-level error-awareness, HIPLAN achieves more coherent and ro- bust progression through long-horizon tasks. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we introduced HIPLAN, a hierarchical plan- ning framework that enhances LLM-based agents\u2019 ability to tackle complex, long-horizon tasks by synergistically com- bining global milestone action guides with adaptive step- wise hints. This integration addresses critical challenges in maintaining global coherence while adapting actions to dy- namic local contexts, leveraging milestone-level experience reuse to balance generalization and specificity effectively. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that HIPLAN signif- icantly improves success rates and robustness across diverse benchmarks and model architectures, outperforming strong baselines. While HIPLAN marks a substantial advancement, several avenues remain for future exploration. One promising di- rection is extending the framework to a broader range of tasks and domains to assess its generalizability and scalabil- ity. Additionally, we plan to investigate methods for summa- rizing and abstracting experience gained through step-wise hints, enabling effective cross-task knowledge transfer and improving adaptation in novel scenarios. We believe that HIPLAN represents a meaningful step to- ward empowering LLM-based agents with robust hierarchi- cal reasoning and adaptive planning capabilities.

TRAD: Enhancing LLM Agents with Step-Wise Thought Retrieval and Aligned Decision. In SIGIR, 3\u201313. A Further Analysis: Step Efficiency In addition to task success rates, a critical measure of an agent\u2019s planning capability is its efficiency, i.e., the ability to complete tasks in a minimal number of steps. Inefficient planning often leads to redundant actions, error-prone explo- ration, and failure to complete tasks within a limited step- horizon. Figure 5 illustrates the average number of steps taken by different methods across the ALFWorld and WebShop benchmarks. HIPLAN consistently requires significantly fewer steps to complete tasks compared to all baselines. On average, HIPLAN achieves a remarkable reduction of 28% in steps on ALFWorld and 37% on WebShop. ALFWorld HIPLAN outperforms all baselines by a sig- nificant margin, reducing the average number of steps by up to 51% compared to REACT and by up to 41% com- pared to Reflexion. Even against the strong retrieval-based TRAD baseline, HIPLAN achieves a 25% reduction in re- quired steps. The improvements hold consistently for both LLaMA and Mixtral backbones. WebShop A similar trend is observed on WebShop. HIPLAN reduces the planning steps by up to 55% com- pared to REACT and by over 40% relative to Reflexion and TRAD. Analysis We attribute the superior step efficiency of HIPLAN to its hierarchical guidance mechanism: global milestone action guides maintain strategic direction, while adaptive step-wise hints correct deviations and eliminate redundant exploration. This dual-level guidance enables agents to advance towards goals in a more focused and error- averse manner, leading to not only higher success rates but also markedly shorter trajectories. In contrast, REACT often exhibits meandering behavior due to its reactive nature, and Reflexion is prone to repeated similar mistakes as it relies on post-hoc, episode-level feedback after a failure. While TRAD shows competitive performance on task success rate, it still requires more steps to complete tasks than HIPLAN, suggesting that its low-level trajectory demonstrations may guide agents along suboptimal planning paths.",
    "and Reflexion is prone to repeated similar mistakes as it relies on post-hoc, episode-level feedback after a failure. While TRAD shows competitive performance on task success rate, it still requires more steps to complete tasks than HIPLAN, suggesting that its low-level trajectory demonstrations may guide agents along suboptimal planning paths. The substantial drop in completion steps across heteroge- neous tasks and LLMs confirms the generalizability and ef- fectiveness of HIPLAN\u2019s design for long-horizon, complex decision-making tasks. B Milestone Library Construction Details The milestone library construction process relies on an au- tomated pipeline that extracts meaningful subgoals from ex- pert demonstration trajectories. We employ GPT-4o to seg- ment each trajectory into semantically coherent milestones using the prompt shown in Figure 6. Milestones Extraction and Trajectory Segmentation The extraction process operates on successful task demon- strations D = {(\u03c4 (i), \u03be(i))}N i=1, where each trajectory \u03be(i) = {(o(i) 1 , a(i) 1 ), ..., (o(i) T (i), a(i) T (i))} corresponds to task \u03c4 (i). For each trajectory, the LLM identifies key milestones and maps trajectory segments to corresponding milestones. Figure 5: Average steps to task completion on ALFWorld and WebShop. HIPLAN consistently achieves goals in fewer steps than baseline methods across both benchmarks, high- lighting its superior planning efficiency. For each identified milestone k \u2208{1, . . . , K(i)}, the LLM provides: \u2022 A description m(i) k capturing the subgoal \u2022 Action indices I(i) k = {t(k) start, . . . , t(k) end} corresponding to the trajectory segment The corresponding trajectory segment is then extracted as: \u03b6(i) k = {(o(i) t , a(i) t ) : t \u2208I(i) k } This segmentation ensures that each \u03b6(i) k represents a co- hesive sub-trajectory that accomplishes a specific intermedi- ate objective toward the overall task completion. Indexing and Storage The constructed milestone library maintains a hierarchical organization with two-level in- dexing. At the task level, entries are indexed by task embedding vectors v(i) task for efficient task-level retrieval. At the milestone level, individual milestones are indexed by their semantic embeddings v(i,k) milestone, enabling fine- grained milestone-level retrieval. Each entry stores tu- ples of the form (v(i) task, v(i,k) milestone, m(i) k , \u03b6(i) k ). All embed- dings are computed using the SentenceTransformers model all-mpnet-base-v2. The detailed statistics of the constructed milestone library are summarized in Table 3. C Experience Retrieval Implementation This section provides detailed implementation of the expe- rience retrieval mechanisms used in HIPLAN for generating global milestone action guides and step-wise hints.

C.1 Task-Level Retrieval for Global Guidance For generating the milestone action guide G\u03c4, HIPLAN re- trieves M = 2 most similar tasks from the milestone library. The retrieval process follows these steps: Task Embedding and Similarity Computation: Given a test-time task instruction \u03c4, we first encode it into a dense vector using SentenceTransformers (all-mpnet-base-v2): v\u03c4 = Embed(\u03c4) (6) ALFWorld WebShop Mm LLaMA Mm LLaMA \u00a9 Mixtral . \u00a9 Mixtral 33.2 HiPlan REACT Reflexion TRAD HiPlan REACT Reflexion TRAD Methods Methods Metric ALFWorld WebShop Total Source demonstrations 500 77 577 Avg. milestones per trajectory 5.89 5.00 5.77 Avg. actions per milestone 1.78 1.11 1.70 Total entries 2,945 385 3,330 Table 3: Statistics of the constructed milestone library across ALFWorld and WebShop datasets. The similarity between the query task and each stored task is computed using normalized dot product: sim(v\u03c4, vtask(i)) = v\u03c4 \u00b7 vtask(i) \u2225v\u03c4\u2225\u2225vtask(i)\u2225 (7) Ranking and Selection: Tasks are ranked by similarity in descending order, and the top-M = 2 most similar tasks are selected: {(\u03c4 (j), \u03be(j), G\u03c4 (j))}M j=1 = TopK(sim(v\u03c4, vtask(i)), M) (8) Length-based Re-ranking: The retrieved demonstra- tions are further re-ranked by trajectory length to prioritize shorter, more generalizable examples that provide clearer structural guidance. C.2 Milestone-Level Retrieval for Local Guidance For generating step-wise hints ht, HIPLAN retrieves top- P = 2 most similar milestones from the milestone library. The process follows similar embedding and similarity com- putation steps as global guidance retrieval, but operates at the milestone-level rather than task-level. Trajectory-level Deduplication: Since similar mile- stones may exist within the same trajectory and could be re- called together, we enforce that no two selected milestones come from the same expert trajectory to ensure the diversity of demonstrations. This prevents over-reliance on specific trajectories and enhances generalization. Trajectory Segment Recovery: For each retrieved mile- stone, we access the corresponding pre-stored trajectory segment that completes the milestone. For each trajectory segment, we include one additional action step to provide forward-looking context. We set M = 2 for global guidance retrieval and P = 2 for step-wise hint retrieval based on empirical observations. These values align with established practices in in-context learning, where 2-3 examples typically yield optimal perfor- mance without introducing excessive noise or computational overhead. D Error Mode Analysis Despite the overall strong performance of HIPLAN across diverse long-horizon tasks, we observe certain failure cases that highlight challenges in reasoning under partial observ- ability and language ambiguity.

    "observe certain failure cases that highlight challenges in reasoning under partial observ- ability and language ambiguity. In this section, we analyze the common error modes on the ALFWorld and WebShop benchmarks. These cases help reveal not only the complex- ity of the task environments but also opportunities for further enhancing hierarchical planning and adaptive reasoning. D.1 ALFWorld ALFWorld poses embodied household tasks in a simulated environment with partially observable textual descriptions. We identify the following types of failure patterns: Semantic Misidentification of Task Entities. In some tasks, the agent misidentifies the correct object due to per- sistent failure in locating the instructed item, ultimately de- faulting to a semantically or functionally similar alternative. For instance, when tasked with retrieving an \u201capple,\u201d the agent may eventually pick up a \u201ctomato\u201d after repeated un- successful attempts to find the target. This behavior high- lights a core challenge in balancing flexibility and strict in- struction adherence: while the agent adapts to the environ- ment by choosing an available, plausible object, it risks de- viating from the intended goal when precise specification is essential. Inefficient Exploration and Repetition. We observe cases where the agent repeatedly visits previously checked locations, especially in environments with many distrac- tors. For example, in the task requiring the agent to \u201cheat an egg and put it in the garbagecan,\u201d over 40 steps were spent re-opening the same refrigerator, drawers, and non- existent objects like \u201cdiningtable 1\u201d before finally locating the egg in an unexpected container (the garbagecan itself). Such inefficient loops can be attributed to the partial observ- ability of the environment and the difficulty in reasoning about uncommon object placements. While HIPLAN pro- vides milestone-level direction, it occasionally lacks fine- grained memory consolidation to prevent redundant behav- ior in exploration-heavy subtasks. Failure to Satisfy Implicit Task Constraints. In cer- tain cases, the agent transitions to the next milestone with- out fully completing the current one, due to an inaccu- rate judgment of milestone completion based on recent ac- tions and observations. For example, in the task \u201cput a cool tomato in the microwave,\u201d the agent moves the tomato into the microwave without successfully performing the cool- ing step\u2014despite this being an explicitly defined milestone in the generated action guide. This indicates that while HIPLAN maintains a structured global plan, it occasionally struggles to determine whether a milestone has been gen- uinely achieved from textual cues alone. Such errors reflect the inherent ambiguity in inferring milestone completion in text-only, partially observable environments, where changes in object state (e.g., cooled vs. not cooled) may not be ex- plicitly described. D.2 WebShop WebShop introduces a distinct class of long-horizon reason- ing tasks focused on goal-directed online shopping. We ob- serve the",
    "reflect the inherent ambiguity in inferring milestone completion in text-only, partially observable environments, where changes in object state (e.g., cooled vs. not cooled) may not be ex- plicitly described. D.2 WebShop WebShop introduces a distinct class of long-horizon reason- ing tasks focused on goal-directed online shopping. We ob- serve the following error modes: Specification Drift in Product Selection. Some agents fail to strictly adhere to all constraints specified in the in- struction, such as size, material, or color. In one example, although the user explicitly requested a product with \u201c6.76 fl oz\u201d volume, the agent skipped the option selection step and directly purchased the default variant. This behavior stems from partial satisfaction of constraints (e.g., product match but wrong size) and suggests limitations in multi-attribute reasoning under ambiguous product descriptions. Action Loops and Invalid Sequences. We observe cases where the agent repeatedly issues invalid or ineffective ac- tions, often resulting in prolonged sequences of failure. These loops typically emerge when the agent attempts to execute actions that are not applicable to the current page or context\u2014such as clicking a button that does not exist on the current interface. This suggests that, in certain situations, the agent fails to properly analyze the local environment before acting and does not robustly retry alternative strate- gies when actions are invalid. Such behavior underscores the challenge of accurately grounding decision-making in tran- sient UI states within text-based environments, and the occa- sional lack of sufficient corrective mechanisms in the step- wise hint generation process. Underutilization of Available Information. In certain tasks, agents overlook available high-quality candidates pre- sented early in the session. For example, a correct item ap- peared in the first search results but was ignored in favor of less suitable alternatives. In some cases, agents also skipped detailed product descriptions and features, leading to pre- mature purchase decisions that violated key constraints like \u201clace closure\u201d or \u201cwater resistance.\u201d These failures indicate occasional overemphasis on surface cues (e.g., color or title keywords) over deeper semantic validation. E Baselines Implementation Details E.1 REACT We used the official REACT codebase, which includes ex- periments on both ALFWorld and WebShop. All settings were aligned with ours. For ALFWorld, we used the same 134 out-of-distribution tasks with a maximum of 50 steps. For WebShop, we used the same 200 test queries with a 40- step limit. E.2 Reflexion We adopted the official RefleXion codebase, which supports experiments on ALFWorld and WebShop. All settings were adjusted to match ours. On ALFWorld, we used the same 134 out-of-distribution tasks with a 50-step limit, running three reflection rounds. On WebShop, we used the same 200 test queries with a 40-step cap, also running three rounds. E.3 Trad For the ALFWorld",

On WebShop, we used the same 200 test queries with a 40-step cap, also running three rounds. E.3 Trad For the ALFWorld dataset, we adopted the original TRAD implementation, which includes experiments on this bench- mark. We reused the official codebase and modified all set- tings to match those used by our method. Specifically, we used the same 134 out-of-distribution tasks and capped the maximum number of steps at 50. For the WebShop dataset, the original TRAD paper did not provide experimental results. Therefore, we carefully implemented the method based on the official description. All prompts used in our implementation are shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8. During the WebShop experiments, we used the same 77 expert demonstrations as our method for retrieval and the same 200 test tasks. The maximum number of al- lowed steps was set to 40.

From empathy to introspection, from wisdom to curiosity MovieCORE tests VLMs\u2019 ability to comprehend the deeper elements of movies. Abstract This paper introduces MovieCORE, a novel video question answering (VQA) dataset de- signed to probe deeper cognitive understand- ing of movie content. Unlike existing datasets that focus on surface-level comprehension, MovieCORE emphasizes questions that engage System-2 thinking while remaining specific to the video material. We present an innovative agentic brainstorming approach, utilizing mul- tiple large language models (LLMs) as thought agents to generate and refine high-quality question-answer pairs. To evaluate dataset quality, we develop a set of cognitive tests as- sessing depth, thought-provocation potential, and syntactic complexity. We also propose a comprehensive evaluation scheme for assess- ing VQA model performance on deeper cogni- tive tasks. To address the limitations of exist- ing video-language models (VLMs), we intro- duce an agentic enhancement module, Agentic Choice Enhancement (ACE), which improves model reasoning capabilities post-training by 25%. Our work contributes to advancing movie understanding in AI systems and provides valu- able insights into the capabilities and limita- tions of current VQA models when faced with more challenging, nuanced questions about cin- ematic content.

Recent movie-based VQA datasets (Wu and Kra- henbuhl, 2021; Song et al., 2024; Rawal et al., 2024) primarily focus on surface-level understand- ing, neglecting the challenge of comprehending movies at a deeper cognitive level. They predomi- nantly address the \u201cwhat\u201d by posing questions such as \u201cWhat is the relationship between the actors?\u201d or \u201cWhat time does the video take place?\u201d, and largely overlook the \u201chow,\u201d \u201cwhy,\u201d and \u201cwhy not\u201d questions crucial for achieving a profound under- standing of movies. While EgoSchema (Mangalam et al., 2023) attempts to delve beyond the obvious, its more profound questions often remain general. We propose MovieCORE, a novel VQA dataset designed to engage System-2 thinking\u2014the slow, deliberate, and logical cognitive processes\u2014while maintaining strict relevance to specific video con- tent. Unlike existing datasets, MovieCORE em- braces the inherent subjectivity of \"why\" and \"why not\" questions as a feature rather than a limita- tion, creating both meaningful challenges and re- search opportunities. To generate comprehensive and faithful question-answer pairs, we develop an agentic brainstorming approach that leverages mul- tiple large language models (LLMs) as interactive thought agents that engage in continuous discus- sions to refine QA pairs. We validate the quality of the QAs through rigorous human review of a rep- resentative subset. Additionally, we employ quan- titative cognitive metrics to measure our dataset\u2019s depth and syntactic complexity relative to existing benchmarks. Our evaluation of current VQA mod- els on MovieCOREreveals critical insights about their performance on these challenging cognitive tasks. To address identified limitations and im- prove existing VLMs\u2019 deeper cognitive reasoning capabilities, we introduce Agentic Choice Enhance- ment (ACE), which demonstrates relative perfor- mance improvements of up to 25% compared to baseline approaches. Our key contributions are the following: \u2022 We introduce MovieCORE, a VQA dataset focused on thought-provoking questions and answers specific to movie content. \u2022 We develop an agentic brainstorming ap- proach using multiple LLMs as agents to gen- erate and refine high-quality QA pairs. \u2022 We implement a set of cognitive tests to eval- uate the depth, thought-provocation, and com- plexity of VQA datasets. \u2022 We design a comprehensive evaluation scheme to assess the accuracy, comprehensive- ness, depth, and coherence of answers from existing Vision Language Models (VLMs). \u2022 We evaluate several VLMs on our dataset in both zero-shot and fully-supervised settings, offering insights into their performance on deeper cognitive tasks. \u2022 We propose a post-training \"agentic selection\" plugin to improve existing VLMs and show a relative improvement of up to 25% compared to the baseline. 2 Related Work Movie-Based Question-Answering Datasets.",

Re- cent video understanding benchmarks are often based on movie scenes because films offer a rich blend of multimodal content, combining visual, linguistic, and temporal elements within complex narratives. Early efforts like MovieQA (Tapaswi et al., 2016) explores entire movie understanding but were limited by questions heavily relying on di- alogue. TVQA (Lei et al., 2018) requires reasoning over multiple events in short TV series clips, inte- grating visuals and subtitles. LVU (Wu and Krahen- buhl, 2021) addresses scaling video comprehension to extended sequences, necessitating models to pro- cess long temporal contexts. MAD (Soldan et al., 2022) and its extension (Han et al., 2023) focus on scene-level descriptions through audio and visuals but were mainly used for scene annotation tasks with limited narrative comprehension. MoVQA (Zhang et al., 2023) introduces multi-level ques- tions, challenging models in temporal perception, causal reasoning, and narrative synthesis. CinePile (Rawal et al., 2024) automates large-scale question generation across varied scenes and question type and MovieChat-1k (Song et al., 2024) focuses on basic understanding of cinematic contexts. Video Question-Answering Reasoning. Text- based reasoning datasets like DROP (Dua et al., 2019) and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) handle discrete reasoning tasks, including counting and arithmetic, but are limited to textual inputs and do not address the complexities involved in integrat- ing visual reasoning.

Perception Test (Patraucean et al., 2024) broadens perceptual reasoning to varied video contexts, assessing high- level reasoning abilities. Multi-task and complex video benchmarks, such as MVBench (Li et al., 2024), Video-MME (Fu et al., 2024), and MLVU (Zhou et al., 2024), integrate multiple reasoning challenges, requiring predictive reasoning, memory recall, and cross-modal inference over long video sequences. While these datasets have advanced various aspects of video understanding, they pre- dominantly rely on surface-level comprehension of video content. Our work introduces the first dataset specifically designed to evaluate System-2 reasoning in the video domain, requiring models to engage in slow, deliberate, and analytical thinking processes aiming to mirror human approaches to complex movie understanding. 3 MovieCORE Creation and Curation To address the challenge of obtaining question- answer pairs that delve into deeper levels of movie understanding, we propose an agentic annotation workflow. This approach leverages the deliberative capabilities of multiple LLMs acting as specialized agents, each contributing unique perspectives to the annotation process. We start with video context extraction to make sure our text-only annotation agents have enough information about the video. 3.1 Video Context Extraction The videos for our dataset are sourced from MovieChat-1k (Song et al., 2024), a collection of 1,000 movie clips averaging 10 minutes each. We use 986 of these clips, as 14 were either unavailable or lacked necessary annotations. MovieChat-1k, already provides high-level information for each video, such as temporal setting (e.g., ancient or modern) and metadata like the movie\u2019s genre. Al- though some videos in the original dataset include captions, we observe inaccuracies and imbalanced descriptions. Therefore, we exclude these cap- tions, focusing instead on the existing QA pairs and movie metadata. To provide video context, we utilize MiniCPM- v2.6 (Yao et al., 2024), an open-source model with visual capabilities comparable to GPT-4V. We prompt it with a carefully curated set of eight ques- tions (shown in Figure S1 in the supplementary material) designed to extract a multi-dimensional understanding of the video. These questions ad- dress narrative structure, thematic focus, emotional tone, key events, character dynamics, genre, and target audience. The extracted information serves as Data Info priors for our agents. 3.2 Agentic Annotation Workflow Our workflow, illustrated in Figure 2, employs a multi-agent system orchestrated by a Critic Agent acting as the master of ceremonies (MC). Using the Agentic AI framework autogen (Wu et al., 2024), we deploy instances of GPT4-o for the VQA Ex- pert and Meta Reviewer roles (as these positions de- mand superior reasoning capabilities), with GPT4- o-mini powering the other expert agents.

Using the Agentic AI framework autogen (Wu et al., 2024), we deploy instances of GPT4-o for the VQA Ex- pert and Meta Reviewer roles (as these positions de- mand superior reasoning capabilities), with GPT4- o-mini powering the other expert agents. The pro- cess begins as the Critic Agent receives task instruc- tions and video context (Data Info) extracted as described in Section 3.1 and sends them to the Sys- tem II VQA Expert who generates questions that engage System-2 thinking. These initial QA pairs are then scrutinized by the Skeptical Researcher, 3 Single-Pass Annotation: Q: How does the interaction between the two main characters (the one in red and black costume and the one in black with cat-like ears) evolve throughout the video, and what might this suggest about their relationship? A: The interaction begins with a casual encounter and evolves into a clear partnership as they traverse the city together. This progression in their relationship suggests a deepening bond based on mutual goals or shared challenges, hinting at themes of teamwork and trust. Agentic Annotation: Q: Can you provide specific scenes that demonstrate the evolution and motivations of the main characters in their relationship? A: Yes, there is a scene where the character in the red and black costume helps the one in black with cat-like ears from falling, showing a bond of trust forming. Another scene depicts them working seamlessly together to navigate a tricky rooftop, reflecting their growing partnership. Their motivations seem rooted in overcoming a common threat, as further evidenced by the scene where they both face the glowing purple heart-shaped entity. Figure 3: Comparison of single-pass and agentic annotation. The agentic method (bottom) elicits specific scene details, concrete examples, and detailed story elements, demonstrating the enhanced granularity achieved through multi-agent refinement. Text in blue indicates new, specific details absent in the single-pass version. The single-pass annotation (top), on the other hand, while also attempting to ask deeper questions, remains at a more abstract level. who evaluates their contextual relevance and accu- racy, often challenging the VQA Expert to provide more concrete evidence. The Detective agent fol- lows, suggesting additional questions to uncover underlying motivations and biases. The Meta Re- viewer synthesizes these insights, proposing en- hancements to the initial VQAs. The Critic Agent then consolidates this feedback for the VQA Ex- pert to refine the QAs. The process concludes with human expert evaluation of a subset of the refined VQAs, assessing their clarity, depth, relevance, and answerability. This agentic annotation workflow mimics collaborative human expert discussions by harnessing collective intelligence and mitigating potential biases of any single agent1.

This agentic annotation workflow mimics collaborative human expert discussions by harnessing collective intelligence and mitigating potential biases of any single agent1. To ensure the quality and reliability of our dataset, we implement a rigorous human verifi- cation process. Seven graduate students were re- cruited to assess a subset of 30 videos, 30 captions and 150 QA pairs. The final human validation ensures that the resulting VQAs meet the highest standards of quality and depth. We provide more details on the human validation in Appendix II.3. 1Wondering why we chose these specific agents? Please see Appendix II.4 and II.5 3.3 Agentic versus Single-Pass Annotation To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed Agen- tic Annotation workflow, we compare the quality of the VQAs generated by the System II VQA Expert in the initial round (single-pass) and those produced through our workflow after the agent has gathered feedback and enhancement ideas from other ex- perts (agentic annotation). As shown in Figure 3, the agentic annotation approach demonstrates clear advantages over single-pass annotation. While the single-pass annotation provides a general, abstract description of character relationships, the agentic annotation generates questions that ask for and an- swers that deliver specific, concrete details about key scenes that support the relationship develop- ment of the characters \u2013 including the falling scene, rooftop navigation, and confrontation with the pur- ple heart-shaped entity. The agentic process elicits richer context and more granular evidence, mak- ing the annotations more specific and faithful to the movie content. It also makes the dataset much more valuable for training and evaluating AI sys- tems\u2019 understanding of narrative progression and character dynamics. This suggests that using mul- tiple AI agents as thought partners leads to more detailed and substantive annotations compared to traditional single-pass methods used by other auto- 4 Dataset Parse Tree Depth F\u2013K Grade Score BT Level HO-QA (%) Q A Avg Q A Avg MovieChat-1k (Song et al., 2024) 3.58 1.31 2.45 3.19 -0.39 1.4 1.8 0.0 ActivityNetQA (Yu et al., 2019) 4.24 0.27 2.26 2.69 0.98 1.84 1.9 0.2 MVBench (Li et al., 2024) 3.96 1.71 2.84 4.74 1.47 3.11 2.2 3.4 EgoSchema (Mangalam et al., 2023) 6.56 4.38 5.47 10.52 6.08 8.30 3.1 33.1 MovieCORE 5.38 6.39 5.88 12.98 15.07 14.03 4.9 99.2 Table 1: Syntactic Complexity and Cognitive Demand Comparison: Parse tree depth, Flesch-Kincaid (F-K) grade scores, average Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy (BT) level, and percentage of higher-order questions and answers (HO-QA) across various VQA datasets.

More comparisons be- tween agentic and single-pass annotation can be found in Appendix II.4. 3.4 Dataset Description MovieCORE is a video question-answering (VQA) dataset designed to probe deeper cognitive under- standing of movie content. The dataset comprises 986 videos paired with 4,930 corresponding ques- tions and answers and 986 captions. Following the splits of the original MovieChat-1k dataset (Song et al., 2024), we split MovieCORE into 4080 QAs for training (816 videos) and 850 for testing (170 videos). The primary application of MovieCORE lies in training and evaluating VQA models\u2019 capa- bilities in deeper cognitive tasks. The questions are specifically designed to assess models\u2019 abil- ities to comprehend complex narrative elements, character motivations, and subtle contextual cues \u2013 skills that are crucial for achieving human-like un- derstanding of cinematic content. A wordcloud of MovieCORE is shown in Figure 4 suggest- ing complex themes regarding character dynam- ics, emotional resonance, and societal implications through terms like \u201ctension,\u201d \u201cpsychological,\u201d \u201ccul- tural,\u201d and \u201cemotional.\u201d Also, the prominence of analytical terms such as \u201cunderscore\u201d,\u201cdepth,\u201d and \u201ccritical,\u201d suggests questions that probe deeper in- terpretations and thematic elements rather than just literal plot descriptions. 4 Experiments 4.1 Linguistic and Cognitive Complexity To evaluate the effectiveness of MovieCORE in engaging System-2 thinking and promoting deeper cognitive processing, we conduct a series of tests designed to assess the complexity, readability, and cognitive demand of our questions and answers. Figure 4: Wordcloud illustrating key themes and con- cepts of MovieCORE with terms such as \"emotional\", \"character\" and \"influence\" very prominent. These tests include well-established metrics such as parse tree depth, Flesch-Kincaid grade score, and Bloom\u2019s taxonomy classification. Each pro- vides unique insights into different aspects of our dataset\u2019s ability to stimulate higher-order think- ing. Table 1 presents a comparative analysis of MovieCORE against other VQA datasets. Parse Tree Depth measures the syntactic com- plexity of sentences by analyzing their hierarchical structure. We utilize this metric to assess the struc- tural intricacy of our questions and answers. We employ the spaCy library to generate parse trees for each question and answer in our dataset and re- cursively compute their depth as follows. Let d(t) be the depth of a token t in the tree. For a token with children C(t), the depth is defined as: d(t) = ( 0 if C(t) = \u2205 1 + maxc\u2208C(t) d(c) if C(t) \u0338= \u2205 (1) where d(t) =",

For a token with children C(t), the depth is defined as: d(t) = ( 0 if C(t) = \u2205 1 + maxc\u2208C(t) d(c) if C(t) \u0338= \u2205 (1) where d(t) = 0 if t is a leaf node (no children), d(t) = 1 + maxc\u2208C(t) d(c) if t has children C(t), with maxc\u2208C(t) d(c) representing the maximum depth of the children of t. For a sentence with mul- tiple tokens, the depth of the parse tree D rooted at the token r (root of the sentence) is D = d(r).

A greater parse tree depth often corre- lates with more complex sentence structures, which typically require more cognitive resources to pro- cess. By measuring this, we aim to quantify the linguistic sophistication of our VQAs as compared to existing datasets\u2019, hypothesizing that questions and answers with higher parse tree depths are more likely to engage System-2 thinking.

    "to existing datasets\u2019, hypothesizing that questions and answers with higher parse tree depths are more likely to engage System-2 thinking. Table 1 shows that MovieCORE has the highest average parse tree depth compared to the other VQA datasets. The Flesch-Kincaid (F-K) Grade Score is a read- ability measure that indicates the U.S. grade level needed to understand a text. We calculate this score for both questions and answers in our dataset using the standard Flesch-Kincaid formula below F-K Grade Score = 0.39 \u0000 W S \u0001 + 11.8 \u0000 Y W \u0001 \u221215.59 (2) where W is the total number of words in the text, S, total number of sentences and Y the total number of syllables. While our goal is not to make the content unnec- essarily difficult, a moderately high Flesch-Kincaid score indicates that the QAs require a more ad- vanced level of comprehension and thinking. As shown in Table 1, MovieCORE substantially out- performs other datasets with an average grade score of 14.03, with its closest competitor \u2013 EgoSchema (Mangalam et al., 2023) \u2013 standing at 8.3. Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy is a hierarchical model used to classify educational learning objectives into lev- els of complexity and specificity (Mcdaniel, 1970). We prompt GPT-4o-mini with a comprehensive breakdown of the Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy and ask it to classify each question and answer into one of six cognitive levels: Remember (1), Understand (2), Apply (3), Analyze (4), Evaluate (5), and Create (6). Such classification helps us assess the cognitive demand of the QAs. Questions falling into higher levels of Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy (Analyze, Evaluate, Create) require deeper analysis and critical think- ing skills susceptible to trigger System-2 thinking. MovieCORE achieves the highest average Bloom Taxonomy Level (BT Level) of 4.9, indicating that our questions and answers predominantly engage higher-order cognitive skills, significantly surpass- ing the other datasets. Additionally, we report the percentage of higher-order questions and answers (HO-QA), representing the proportion of both ques- tions and answers that fall into the upper levels of Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy (levels 4-6). MovieCORE ex- cels in this metric with 99.2% of its questions and answers classified as higher-order.

    "Enhancement We propose ACE, a straightforward yet effective ap- proach to improving existing video language model (VLM) outputs through post-generation refinement. Our approach, detailed in Algorithm 1, uses an ex- isting VLM and leverages beam search with a width of 5 to generate diverse candidate responses, which are then re-ranked using the compact 1B-parameter Llama-3.2 (MetaAI, 2024) language model. We hypothesize that, when engaging in a task requir- ing deeper deliberation, it is advisable to have a second pair of eyes to refine one\u2019s thinking. The lightweight nature of Llama-3.2 (1B) ensures that this enhancement remains computationally efficient while significantly improving the quality of gen- erated responses. We prompt the model without specific evaluation guidelines, allowing it to lever- age its inherent understanding of \u201canswer quality\u201d. Table 2 show that this \u201cagentic selection\u201d approach paired with HERMES (Faure et al., 2024) (HER- MES + ACE) registers an absolute gain of 0.48 compared to the baseline VLM, which translates to roughly a 16 percent improvement in answer qual- ity. It also improves InstructBLIP (Dai et al., 2023) by 25% (2.63\u21923.29) and MA-LMM (He et al., 2024) by 20% (2.79\u21923.35). These results suggest that existing VLMs have untapped potential that can be realized through a simple post-generation \u201csecond pair of eyes\u201d strategy, offering a practical path to training-free improvement. Table 3 shows similar performance across beam widths (3, 5 and 7) for HERMES, suggesting ACE\u2019s effectiveness stems from the agentic selec- tion mechanism itself rather than hyperparameter choices. These results validate our framework\u2019s fundamental premise: lightweight post-generation refinement can unlock significant untapped poten- tial in existing VLMs. 6 Model Accuracy Comprehensiveness Depth Evidence Coherence Avg.

We evaluate various open-source and proprietary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on five criteria: Accuracy, Comprehensiveness, Depth, Evidence, and Coherence.

ACE improves performance across all evaluation dimensions regardless of the beam size, with no clear winner among the different beam values. 6 Quantitative Evaluation VQA datasets usually use top-1 accuracy as met- rics, but a valid match has to be a perfect match. For instance, there can be one strict answer to the question \u201cDoes sea appear in the video?\u201d, which is \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d. However, in the age of LLMs and es- pecially for zero-shot evaluation settings, we might get answers such as \u201cit does\u201d or \u201cno sea appears in the video\u201d. In such cases the accuracy would be 0. Recently, LLM-assisted evaluation schemes such as the one introduced by (Maaz et al., 2023), at- tempt to solve this issue by considering synonyms or paraphrases as valid matches. This works for VQAs where there is a perfect answer, and would not work in our case, especially since accuracy for a System-2 answer is not binary but exists in a spectrum. Furthermore, we posit that accuracy alone is insufficient, therefore we design four other LLM-assisted metrics: depth to assess the depth of reasoning in the answers, comprehensiveness to assess how fully the answer covers all key points and relevant details, coherence and clarity, and evi- dence to evaluate the quality and relevance of the evidence provided. For all of these metrics, we prompt GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI, 2024) to assign a score between 0 to 5 to each. Table 2 presents a comprehensive evaluation of model performance across our five assessment crite- ria. Several key insights emerge from these results: (1) Proprietary models significantly outperform their open-source counterparts. This performance gap indicates that large-scale proprietary training data likely contains more diverse reasoning tasks than those available in public datasets. (2) In the zero-shot setting, most open-source models strug- gle considerably with complex reasoning, except for the more recent InternVL2.5 and Qwen2.5-VL models. The particularly low scores in",

BLEU-4, CIDEr, and METEOR scores for several models on MovieCORE. These results are consistent with the trends observed in our primary evaluation. The top row contains zero-shot results and the bottom row con- tains fully-supervised results. the strongest performance. However, even with full supervision, these models still underperform com- pared to proprietary alternatives, suggesting archi- tectural limitations in handling complex reasoning tasks. (4) Our proposed ACE post-generation strat- egy delivers consistent and substantial improve- ments across models and metrics. 6.1 Evaluation with Traditional Metrics While our primary evaluation in Table 2 empha- sizes metrics tailored for System-2 reasoning, we also report standard VQA and video captioning metrics to enable broader comparison with prior work. Specifically, we compute BLEU-4, CIDEr, and METEOR for several models. These n-gram-based metrics, while limited in capturing the semantic richness and reasoning depth demanded by MovieCORE, provide a famil- iar point of reference relative to traditional VQA benchmarks. As shown in Table 4, the relative ranking of models is consistent with our primary cognitive-oriented evaluation from Table 2: meth- ods enhanced with ACE outperform their baselines, and both zero-shot and fully-supervised models exhibit similar performance trends. 6.2 System-2 vs. System-1 Ablation Study To validate the unique challenges posed by MovieCORE, we conduct a comparative evaluation against a \u201cSystem-1\u201d baseline using the MovieChat- 1k dataset, which is built from the exact same set of video clips but contains simpler, surface-level questions such as \u201cDoes it happen during the day or night?\u201d. For MovieChat-1k, we use the officially reported performance of the HERMES model from its original paper. Since MovieChat-1k reports ac- curacy (using LLM-assisted evaluation), we con- vert its accuracy scores into an equivalent 0\u20135 scale MovieCORE (Score) MovieChat-1k (Acc./Score) Zero-Shot 1.14 78.6% (\u223c3.93) Fully-Supervised 3.52 84.9% (\u223c4.25) Table 5: Comparison of HERMES on MovieCORE (System-2) versus MovieChat-1k (System-1).

MovieChat-1k results are converted to a 0\u20135 scale for comparability. for direct comparison with our multidimensional MovieCORE evaluation. The results in Table 5 reveal a stark performance gap. While HERMES achieves high scores on the surface-level MovieChat-1k benchmark, its perfor- mance drops dramatically on MovieCORE\u2019s ques- tions, even with identical video content. This sub- stantial gap highlights MovieCORE\u2019s emphasis on System-2 reasoning. While HERMES excels on datasets with simple recall (e.g., \u201cDo stars appear in the video?\u201d), it struggles with MovieCORE\u2019s questions that demand deeper causal, motivational, and evidential reasoning, despite being based on the same underlying video content. 7 Qualitative Results Figure 5 provides a qualitative comparison between different models\u2019 responses to questions that re- quire understanding of complex animal behaviors. The figure illustrates how different approaches han- dle the same queries about cheetah social struc- tures and survival strategies. InternVL-2, a strong zero-shot model, provides basic observations but lacks sufficient depth and details. HERMES, a fully-supervised model, also struggles with the details and performs worse than InternVL. HER- MES+ACE, demonstrates enhanced response qual- ity by incorporating specific visual evidence and richer contextual details. As highlighted in the re- sponses, ACE significantly improves the model\u2019s ability to reference specific scenes and provide con- crete examples to support its assertions. 8 Conclusion We introduce MovieCORE, a novel VQA dataset that fills a critical gap in existing movie-based VQA datasets by emphasizing questions designed to en- gage System-2 thinking. Our agentic workflow, which leverages brainstorming agents, enables the generation and refinement of high-quality QA pairs. To measure the cognitive depth of VQA datasets, 8 Figure 5: Qualitative Comparison of Model Responses. This figure contrasts responses from InternVL-2 (zero- shot), HERMES (fully-supervised), and HERMES+ACE on two questions about cheetah behaviors. Purple text highlights conceptual understanding while blue text indicates specific visual evidence and contextual details. Note how ACE enhances responses with more precise scene descriptions and behavioral insights. we devise a set of tests that demonstrate the supe- riority of MovieCORE over existing datasets. Ad- ditionally, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework to assess the performance of VQA mod- els on this dataset. To tackle the challenges posed by MovieCORE, we propose ACE, a lightweight inference-time agentic answer selection plug-in which yields up to 25% relative improvement in answer quality compared to baseline methods, pro- viding insights for future works on this topic. 9 Limitations While MovieCORE offers a significant advance- ment in video question-answering by targeting deeper cognitive understanding, it is not without limitations.

    "to 25% relative improvement in answer quality compared to baseline methods, pro- viding insights for future works on this topic. 9 Limitations While MovieCORE offers a significant advance- ment in video question-answering by targeting deeper cognitive understanding, it is not without limitations. First, although we incorporate hu- man verification for a subset of the dataset, only 30 videos, and 150 QA pairs were manually ver- ified. This improves dataset quality control by averting potential systematic issues; however, the majority of annotations still rely on automated processes. Second, because the dataset is con- structed in part from the MovieChat-1k collection, its genre coverage may be constrained. Certain cinematic genres or narrative styles could be over- represented, limiting the dataset\u2019s generalizability. Finally, MovieCORE \u2019s evaluation is partly LLM- assisted, which, while enabling scalability, may in- herit the limitations and biases of the judge model.

We will also release the annotation agents used for generating and refining question-answer pairs, including the code and configurations for the large language models (LLMs) employed in the agentic brainstorming process. Additionally, we provide detailed instructions for data preprocessing, agent configuration, and evaluation protocols, enabling reproduction of both the dataset generation process and the evaluation scheme. Our annotation system is scalable and has the potential to inspire other researchers to create massive video benchmarks. II More Details on MovieCORE II.1 Extracting \u201cVideo Info\" To generate meaningful interpretations of video content, we employ a structured question frame- work designed to probe various aspects of the video\u2019s narrative, emotional tone, and intended pur- pose. This framework consists of eight prompts, each targeting specific dimensions of video under- standing. The prompts and a continuation of the sample answers they elicit are listed in Figure S1 and roughly contains the following: 1. Step-by-step explanation: Encourages a chronological breakdown of events in the video. 2. Main subject or focus: Identifies the central theme or entity in the video. 3. Overall mood or atmosphere: Captures the emotional tone conveyed by the video. 4. Significant events or actions: Highlights key actions and turning points within the narrative. 5. Main characters or entities: Focuses on the individuals or groups driving the video\u2019s story. 6. Settings and locations: Explores",
    "in the video. 3. Overall mood or atmosphere: Captures the emotional tone conveyed by the video. 4. Significant events or actions: Highlights key actions and turning points within the narrative. 5. Main characters or entities: Focuses on the individuals or groups driving the video\u2019s story. 6. Settings and locations: Explores the physical or contextual backdrop of the video. 7. Genre or category: Classifies the video into a relevant category or type. 8. Intended audience: Identifies the target de- mographic for the video. II.2 Agentic Annotation Details Figure S2 depicts the system messages for the different agents involved in the task of creating system-2 thinking VQAs from system-1 VQAs. The agents and their respective roles are: System-2 Video Question Answering Assistant Responsible for generating up to five system-2 thinking VQA pairs from the given system-1 VQAs. The focus is on creating questions and answers that encourage deeper analysis, critical thinking, and meaningful reflection, while ensuring the insights are grounded in the actual video content. Critic Agent Evaluates the system-2 VQAs cre- ated by the System-2 Video Question Answering Assistant and passes them to various Expert Agents for detailed analysis. The Critic Agent then com- piles the constructive feedback from the experts and returns it to the System-2 Video Question An- swering Assistant, emphasizing the importance of aligning the VQAs with the actual video context. Skeptical Researcher Reviews the questions and answers in the context of the video, analyzing the context and evaluating the system-2 VQAs for their contextual relevance and accuracy. The Skeptical Researcher challenges the assumptions behind the QAs and encourages further evidence-based explo- ration, providing concise and relevant suggestions. Detective Given the video information and the system-2 VQAs, the Detective identifies additional questions that could uncover underlying causes, motivations, or potential biases. The suggestions should be concise, realistic, and directly relevant to the video\u2019s actual content. Meta Reviewer Aggregates the feedback and suggestions from all reviewers (Skeptical Re- searcher, Detective) and provides final insights and suggestions to refine and improve the system-2 VQAs. The Meta Reviewer ensures the feedback 12 1. Explain what happens in the video step-by-step. 2. What is the main subject or focus of this video? 3.

Questions used to prompt MiniCPM Continuations of sample answers Figure S1: Extracting Detailed Context from Videos: We input each video to MiniCPM-v2.6, prompting it with a series of carefully crafted questions (left). The model\u2019s responses (right) provide rich, multi-faceted details about the video, including narrative flow, character information, setting, mood, and target audience. This extracted information serves as Data Info priors to inform our annotation agents, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the video content before the VQA generation process. Detective You are a Detective. Given the Video Information and the system-2 VQAs, What additional questions would you ask to uncover underlying causes, motivations, or potential biases?

Filter away any suggestions that are speculative and do not align with the true context of the video. Figure S2: System Messages for the Annotation Agents is comprehensive, constructive, and truthful to the video\u2019s context and content, filtering out any spec- ulative suggestions. II.3 Human Verification Verification Rules To ensure the quality and reli- ability of our dataset, we implemented a rigorous human verification process. Seven qualified evalua- tors, each holding at least a Bachelor\u2019s degree, were recruited to assess a subset of 30 videos and 150 QA pairs. The verification was conducted through a standardized evaluation form (Figure S4) that assessed four key dimensions: \u2022 Relevance (1-5): Evaluates how directly the question/answer relates to the video content \u2022 Clarity (1-5): Measures the linguistic clarity and absence of ambiguity \u2022 Depth (1-5): Assesses the level of cognitive analysis required \u2022 Answerability (1-5): Determines whether the question can be answered solely from the video content As for the captions, we assessed accuracy, clarity and depth. Evaluators were instructed to watch each video in its entirety and carefully consider the scenes, characters, actions, and dialogues before rating the associated QA pairs. To maintain objectivity, evalu- ators were required to focus solely on the video con- tent when reviewing the QA pairs and encouraged to replay videos when necessary. The evaluation process also included assessing the accuracy and clarity of video captions to ensure comprehensive content accessibility. Verification Result The human verification pro- cess (the rules and interface are illustrated in Fig- ure S4) yields consistently high scores across all evaluated dimensions, as shown in Table S1.

The scores, being above 3.8 indicate strong quality across all evaluated dimensions. tions and answers received notably high scores in clarity (4.3) and depth (4.5 and 4.2 respectively), validating our dataset\u2019s emphasis on deep cogni- tive understanding. The captions also demonstrate strong quality with scores above 3.8 across appli- cable metrics. While answerability scores were slightly lower (3.8 for questions), they remain well above acceptable thresholds, confirming that the questions can be reasonably answered from the video content alone. The sample QA pair for the video depicted in Figure S3 received low scores of 2 each for Answer- ability and Relevance from the human evaluators. However, our human meta-reviewer has determined that the question and answer offer meaningful in- sights and contextual relevance (underlined in the figure). II.4 Agentic versus Single-Pass Annotation As shown in Figure S5, the single-pass annota- tion provides a general interpretation of the themes suggested by the presence of the hippopotamus, focusing on human-animal conflict and critiques of captivity. In contrast, the agentic annotation delves deeper by exploring how the hippopotamus func- tions as a symbol throughout the video, detailing its evolution from a chaotic force to a representation of innocence and victimhood. This nuanced analysis offers specific, concrete details about the symbolic transformation, enhancing the understanding of the narrative\u2019s thematic complexity. In the other exam- ple shown in Figure S6, the single-pass annotation mentions general visual and narrative elements like close-ups and quick scene transitions to build sus- pense. The agentic annotation specifies how visual techniques such as dramatic lighting, shadow play, and strategic camera angles enhance the emotional weight and suspense of key scenes. By provid- ing detailed examples\u2014like capturing a character\u2019s raw emotion through close-ups or creating an omi- nous atmosphere with dim lighting\u2014the agentic ap- proach offers a more granular and faithful depiction of the cinematic techniques used.

Answer: The parade scenes likely feature cultural or historical motifs through costumes, floats These elements enrich the narrative by contextualizing the celebratory aspects within a broader cultural framework, offering viewers deeper insights into the world of the characters. Understanding these references can also underscore themes of heritage, identity, and the collective human experience, enhancing the video's relevance and emotional impact. Your task is to review the Video Question Answering (VQA) pairs to ensure they are appropriate and can be accurately answered by watching the provided video. This involves evaluating the relevance, clarity, depth, and answerability of each question-answer pair in relation to the video content. Video Question Answering Evaluation Form Watch the entire video provided in the link. Pay close attention to the scenes, characters, actions, and dialogues. For each question provided, give a score from 1 to 5 according to the criteria. For each answer provided, give a score from 1 to 5 according to the criteria. Be objective in your evaluation. Focus solely on the content of the video when reviewing the QA pairs. When in doubt, replay the video. If you encounter any issues or have questions, contact the coordinator for assistance.

Single-Pass Annotation: Q: What underlying themes can be inferred from the presence of the large hippopotamus and the reactions of the people around it? A: The presence of the large hippopotamus in an indoor setting, combined with the chaos and panic among the people, suggests themes of human-animal conflict and perhaps a critique of captivity or mistreatment of animals. The transition to a more focused narrative on animal rights, indicated by discussions around a tablet displaying disturbing images, highlights a deeper thematic concern with ethical treatment and possibly animal liberation. Agentic Annotation: Q: How does the hippopotamus function as a symbol throughout the video, and how does its portrayal evolve? A: Initially, the hippopotamus is portrayed as a chaotic and disruptive force, symbolizing the intrusion of wild nature into human spaces. As the narrative unfolds and the characters engage with the animal rights theme, the hippopotamus evolves into a symbol of innocence and victimhood, representing the broader plight of animals in captivity. This shift is emphasized through changes in cinematography, with early chaotic scenes giving way to more empathetic and focused portrayals, reflecting the growing recognition of the animal's plight. Figure S5: Additional Comparison of single-pass and agentic annotation. The agentic method (bottom) delves into specific scene details, such as the hippopotamus\u2019s evolution from a chaotic force to a symbol of innocence, and highlights changes in cinematography that reflect this transformation. The single-pass annotation (top) provides a general interpretation of themes like human-animal conflict without specific scene references. Single-Pass Annotation: Q: How does the video use visual and narrative elements to build suspense or dramatize events? A: The video employs",
    "of innocence, and highlights changes in cinematography that reflect this transformation. The single-pass annotation (top) provides a general interpretation of themes like human-animal conflict without specific scene references. Single-Pass Annotation: Q: How does the video use visual and narrative elements to build suspense or dramatize events? A: The video employs close-ups to capture emotional nuances, quick scene transitions to maintain a dynamic pace, and varied settings to juxtapose different social contexts. Significant actions, like placing items on lockers and the dramatic scene with a camera, are highlighted through focused shots. These visual tactics, combined with a fragmented narrative approach, build suspense and emphasize key dramatic moments. Agentic Annotation: Q: How do visual techniques such as lighting and camera angles enhance the emotional weight and suspense of key scenes? A: Visual techniques like dramatic lighting, shadow play, and strategic camera angles heighten emotional weight and suspense. For instance, a close-up shot can capture a character's raw emotion, while dim lighting and shadows can create an ominous atmosphere during tense moments. These techniques draw viewers into the characters' emotional states and amplify the stakes of key scenes, making the narrative more gripping. Figure S6: Additional Comparison of single-pass and agentic annotation. The agentic method (bottom) specifies visual techniques like dramatic lighting, shadow play, and strategic camera angles that enhance emotional weight and suspense, offering concrete examples like close-up shots capturing raw emotion. The single-pass annotation (top) mentions general visual elements but lacks a detailed analysis of how these techniques impact the narrative. tive annotations compared to traditional single-pass methods. Here we provide a more explicit, step-by-step illustration of how each agent contributes to the refinement of a final question. Step-by-Step Example The following example demonstrates how a question evolves as each agent contributes for the example shown in Figure 3: \u2022 Initial Question (Single-Pass): \u201cHow does the interaction between the two main charac- 16 ters evolve throughout the video, and what might this suggest about their relationship?\u201d This version is abstract and lacks grounding in the specific video content. \u2022 + Skeptical Researcher: \u201cHow does the in- teraction between the two main characters evolve, and can you provide specific scenes as evidence for their relationship?\u201d This agent enforces verifiability, pushing for concrete ref- erences to the video. \u2022 + Detective: \u201cWhat are the underlying mo- tivations that drive the two main characters to form a partnership?\u201d This role introduces causal reasoning, shifting the focus from ob- servable actions to underlying causes. \u2022 Final Agentic Question (Full Workflow): \u201cCan you provide specific scenes that demon- strate the evolution and motivations of the main characters in their relationship?\u201d The final result synthesizes evidence-grounding and causal reasoning into a more challenging, cognitively rich query.

    "the focus from ob- servable actions to underlying causes. \u2022 Final Agentic Question (Full Workflow): \u201cCan you provide specific scenes that demon- strate the evolution and motivations of the main characters in their relationship?\u201d The final result synthesizes evidence-grounding and causal reasoning into a more challenging, cognitively rich query. II.5 Why these Specific Agents Careful examination of the agents interactions re- veals distinct contributions: For the video in Figure S5, System-2 Video Question Answering Assis- tant transforms surface observations into deeper inquiries, exemplified by advancing from simply noting the hippopotamus to asking \"How does the hippopotamus function as a symbol throughout the video, and how does its portrayal evolve?\" The Critic Agent ensures analytical quality, as evident in the transition from merely identifying \"human-animal conflict\" to explicating how the hippo evolves from \"chaotic and disruptive force\" to \"innocence and victimhood.\" The Skeptical Re- searcher challenges assumptions, demonstrated by refining the initial \"critique of captivity\" in- terpretation into a more nuanced analysis of \"the growing recognition of the animal\u2019s plight.\" The Detective uncovers underlying narrative patterns, illustrated by connecting the \"early chaotic scenes giving way to more empathetic portrayals\" with cin- ematographic techniques. The Meta Reviewer syn- thesizes these insights into cohesive annotations, balancing the single-pass observation of \"human- animal conflict\" with the richer agentic interpre- tation of \"intrusion of wild nature into human spaces.\" (We find similar examples while analyz- ing the conversations that led to the QAs in S62). Users can swap agents, but we recommend roles that enforce rigor. III Details on the Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy Figure S7 illustrates Bloom\u2019s pyramid of cognition levels and Figure S8 relays the prompts we use to ask GPT-4o-mini to score the QAs. Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy is a hierarchical classification of cogni- tive skills used in education to structure learning objectives. The taxonomy is divided into six lev- els, progressing from lower-order to higher-order thinking skills: 1. Remembering: Recalling facts and basic con- cepts. 2. Understanding: Explaining ideas or con- cepts. 3. Applying: Using information in new situa- tions. 4. Analyzing: Breaking information into parts to explore relationships. 5. Evaluating: Justifying decisions or opinions. 6. Creating: Producing new or original work. Our dataset scores very high in this metric sug- gesting its propensity to deeply engage the AI sys- tem (VLM)\u2019s cognitive skills. IV Evaluation Methodology The MovieCORE benchmark employs a compre- hensive multi-dimensional evaluation framework for assessing VLMs. The evaluation consists of five key dimensions summarized below. We also include the full prompts for each dimension in Fig- ure S10 and Figure S9. 1. Accuracy Dimension: Evaluates semantic correctness of predicted answers using a 6- point scoring rubric (0\u20135): \u2022 5: Perfect semantic match \u2022 4: Mostly correct with minor inaccura- cies \u2022",

This vision prior- itizes long-term memory, skill transfer, and strategic planning, driven by an intrinsic curiosity to learn and create in dynamic, unpredictable environments. In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning (ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous growth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous, self-motivated interaction with dynamic environ- ments, navigating interdependent tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory: Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal experiences, do- main expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into implicit and intuitive capabilities as \u201csecond nature\". We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a student\u2019s holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife is designed around three key paradigm shifts: From Passive to Proactive, From Context to Memory, and From Imitation to Learning. In this dynamic environment, agents must acquire and distill practical skills and maintain persistent memory to make decisions based on evolving state variables (e.g., resource availability and time). Critically, these agents are also expected to demonstrate intrinsic motivation by setting their own goals and initiating actions without external prompting. StuLife provides a comprehensive platform for evaluating lifelong learning capabilities, including memory retention, skill transfer, and self-motivated behavior. Beyond evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on the StuLife benchmark, we also explore the role of context engineering in advancing AGI. Our results suggest that optimizing how we guide models may be as crucial as improving the models themselves, positioning context engineering as a key enabler of progress toward AGI.

ELL is a continuous learning cycle where an agent evolves through direct interaction with its environment. (a) The core loop of ELL: The agent interacts with the current knowledge to acquire trajectories. This experience is processed through Knowledge Abstraction and Refinement, and the resulting knowledge is validated. (b) Knowledge Abstraction converts raw experience into a structured knowledge base composed of Memory and Skills, which forms the foundation for all future learning and action. (c) Knowledge Refinement ensures the knowledge base remains optimal and up-to-date by dynamically performing four key operations: Add, Update, Delete, or Combine. However, these systems typically operate under strong assumptions: they are trained on static datasets, optimized for a single objective, and deployed in environments assumed to remain unchanged. While effective in controlled settings, this paradigm falls short in capturing the essence of real-world intelligence, where environments are dynamic, goals evolve, and new challenges emerge continuously. Life, unlike most machine learning benchmarks, does not present itself as a series of independent tasks with clear labels and fixed endpoints. Instead, it demands constant adaptation, lifelong learning, and the ability to build upon past experiences to navigate an uncertain future. While existing continual learning (or lifelong learning) methods have made strides in mitigating catastrophic forgetting [10] and enabling models to learn from sequential tasks, they largely operate under constrained assumptions, relying on static datasets, predefined task boundaries, and supervised or semi-supervised signals [11, 12]. These approaches focus primarily on performance retention rather than proactive knowledge acquisition, limiting their ability to support truly autonomous, self-improving agents in dynamic, real-world environments. Similarly, prior studies on self-evolving systems [13, 14], though insightful, often emphasize theoretical frameworks or narrow implementations without integrating comprehensive memory mechanisms, experience-driven skill abstraction, or long-term goal-directed behavior. As the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) intensifies, there is a growing recognition that true intelligence must be open-ended, capable of self-directed exploration, continuous knowledge accumulation, and autonomous adaptation. As a result, there remains a critical gap in developing AI agents that not only retain knowledge across time but also autonomously evolve by learning from experience and transferring skills. \"What we want is a machine that can learn from experience.\" \u2013 Alan Turing",

As a result, there remains a critical gap in developing AI agents that not only retain knowledge across time but also autonomously evolve by learning from experience and transferring skills. \"What we want is a machine that can learn from experience.\" \u2013 Alan Turing It highlights the necessity of our work in introducing a unified framework and benchmark for Experience-driven Lifelong Learning (ELL) that bridges these limitations and advances the pursuit of truly self-evolving intelligence. ELL (Figure 1) represents a fundamental paradigm shift in the development of intelligent agents. This shift posits that machines should accumulate experience and learn from a first-person perspective, moving beyond simply mimicking human knowledge output. We are now entering an era where intelligent agents will no longer rely on static datasets but will acquire first-hand experience through autonomous exploration and interaction with the external world, continually evolving in the process. A truly intelligent agent will actively engage with the world, perceiving, acting, and experimenting to continuously build its unique experiential system. ELL enables AI systems to continuously adapt and improve through persistent memory and accumulated experience, as seen in personalized educational platforms that tailor instruction over time, autonomous laboratory assistants that optimize experiments by learning from past outcomes, and intelligent healthcare systems that deliver individualized care based on longitudinal patient data. 2 (a) The Lifelong Learning Process ae Knowledge Skill Learning Validation Reasoning j ~~ LO Observe Task & Environment Long-term Evolve !!

In this paper, we introduce a formal and mathematically grounded framework for ELL, where agents learn continuously from sequential task interactions. By shifting from conceptual vision to a concrete framework, ELL establishes a foundation for building agents that evolve through real-world experience.

    "foundation for building agents that evolve through real-world experience. At its core, ELL is driven by a rigorous continual experiential learning mechanism, centered on: \u2022 Experience Exploration: The agent must be capable of sequentially decomposing and executing complex, long- horizon tasks that involve continuous interaction over minutes to hours with unquantifiable rewards. Through sustained and self-motivated engagement, it generates rich experiential data, enabling iterative learning and self- correction. This persistent interaction allows the agent to progressively refine strategies and adapt behavior based on dynamic feedback, mimicking the trial-and-error process of real-world learning. \u2022 Long-term Memory: Experiential data is systematically processed and consolidated into persistent and structured memory, including raw observations, key events, learned facts, temporal contexts, and self-reflective insights. Memory is not passive storage but an active resource: it supports retrieval over long time spans, enables context-aware reasoning, and forms the foundation for future decision-making. \u2022 Skill Learning: The agent abstracts recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, such as decision rules, functional modules, or problem-solving heuristics. These skills are explicitly constructed through reflection and validated through application in new and evolving tasks. The agent actively manages its skill repertoire, adding, refining, combining, or deprecating skills based on performance, creating a dynamic, self-improving system. \u2022 Knowledge Internalization: Beyond storing memories and reusing skills, the agent undergoes a process of knowl- edge internalization, transforming explicit and discrete knowledge into implicit and intuitive understanding. Over time, frequently used rules, patterns, and strategies are distilled into the agent\u2019s core reasoning process, reducing reliance on external retrieval or step-by-step reflection. This shift from deliberate application to automatic execution mirrors the cognitive transition from novice to expert, where learned behavior becomes \u201csecond nature.\" To evaluate and advance such systems, we construct an experience-driven lifelong learning evaluation dataset for intelligent agents, named StuLife, designed to simulate the entire college experience of a student, from enrollment to personal growth, providing a comprehensive benchmark for assessing agents\u2019 continuous learning and autonomous decision-making capabilities in complex, dynamic environments. The dataset features three core phases and ten granular sub-scenarios, with the following key characteristics: \u2022 From Simulation to Reality: The dataset covers pivotal stages of university life, including in-class tasks (e.g., Regu- lations Learning(Academic and Institutional Norms), Core Course Instruction), Daily Campus Tasks (e.g., Campus Exploration, Initial Course Selection, Preliminary Planning, Academic Activity, Library Resource Management, and Student Club Engagement), and Examination Tasks (e.g., Midterm Exams and Final Exams).

They must proactively manage agendas, set personal objectives, anticipate future needs, and adapt to changing conditions, demonstrating initiative and contextual intelligence akin to human learners navigating complex, open-ended environments. We conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs to evaluate their lifelong learning capabilities within the StuLife benchmark. Furthermore, we investigate the role of context engineering, the strategic structuring of memory, prompts, and task histories, as a pathway toward more robust and adaptive general intelligence, offering insights into the development of self-evolving AI systems. 2 Related Work 2.1 Continual Learning Continual learning (CL), also known as lifelong learning, aims to enable machine learning models to learn sequentially from a stream of data or tasks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting, the tendency to overwrite previously acquired knowledge [12]. A significant body of research has developed techniques to address this stability-plasticity dilemma, including regularization methods [10], architectural modifications [15, 16, 17], and replay-based strategies [18]. Recent surveys have cataloged these approaches across various domains, including deep networks [19], large language models (LLMs) [11], and generative models [20]. To address the varied complexities of real-world learning, CL research defines several experimental settings, including Task-Incremental Learning (TIL), Domain-Incremental Learning (DIL) and Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [21]. However, many existing CL paradigms operate under constrained assumptions, such as the presence of predefined task boundaries and access to supervised or semi-supervised signals. They often rely on static datasets or controlled data streams, which limits their applicability to dynamic, real-world environments where task boundaries are ambiguous and data arrives continuously and autonomously [22]. Furthermore, while effective for retaining performance on past tasks, traditional CL primarily focuses on knowledge preservation rather than proactive exploration and knowledge acquisition. 2.2 Self-Evolving Agent The pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has spurred interest in self-evolving agents\u2014systems capable of autonomous, open-ended growth and adaptation [23, 13]. These agents aim to move beyond static models by continuously learning from experience, refining their skills, and potentially modifying their own architectures or goals. Research in this area explores mechanisms for self-improvement, including reflective reasoning, memory augmentation from past interactions [24]. Effective memory systems are critical for self-evolution, enabling agents to store, retrieve, and optimize experiences [25, 26, 27]. Some frameworks demonstrate self-evolution through mechanisms like self-play, generating novel experiences without specific human-provided data [28]. While surveys highlight the potential of integrating continual learning with other cognitive components like memory and reasoning to create self-evolving systems, current implementations often remain theoretical or focused on narrow applications. A key challenge lies in developing comprehensive frameworks that integrate robust memory mechanisms, facilitate autonomous skill acquisition, and support long-term, goal-directed behavior necessary for truly autonomous agents with self-motivation in",

A key challenge lies in developing comprehensive frameworks that integrate robust memory mechanisms, facilitate autonomous skill acquisition, and support long-term, goal-directed behavior necessary for truly autonomous agents with self-motivation in complex, real-world scenarios. 3 Formal Definitions of Experience-Driven Lifelong Learning Building a formal framework for experience-driven lifelong learning requires first establishing the foundational concepts that model an agent\u2019s interaction with its world. We conceptualize an agent (Definition 5) operating within an environment (E, Definition 1), which we model as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) [29], to accomplish a given sequence of tasks (T , Definition 2). Through its sequential interactions, the agent generates a trajectory (\u03be, Definition 3), which encapsulates the observations, actions, and outcomes of its endeavors. This 4 PRIME AI paper raw trajectory is not merely stored but is progressively distilled and structured into a comprehensive knowledge (K, Definition 4). This knowledge, comprising both memory and skills, forms the foundation upon which the agent adapts its policy, improves its performance, and ultimately achieves lifelong learning. The following subsections will provide rigorous definitions for each of these fundamental concepts. 3.1 Formal Definitions of Fundamental Concepts Definition 1 (Environment). We model the agent\u2019s environment E as a goal-conditional partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), defined by the 8-tuple: E = (S, A, G, T, R, \u2126, O, \u03b3), (1) where: \u2022 S (State Space): The set of all possible states. Each state s \u2208S can contain multimodal information, such as textual descriptions, images, or structured data. \u2022 A (Action Space): The set of all actions the agent can perform. Each action a \u2208A is often a natural language command, e.g., \"add this item to the cart\". \u2022 G (Goal Space): The set of all possible goals. Each goal g \u2208G defines a specific task for the agent to complete, e.g., \"purchase a laptop\". \u2022 T(s\u2032 | s, a) (State Transition Function): Defines the probability distribution over the next state s\u2032 after taking action a in state s. \u2022 R(s, a, g) (Goal-Conditional Reward Function): Evaluates how well action a taken in state s contributes to achieving goal g, returning either a numeric score or textual feedback. \u2022 \u2126(Observation Space): The set of all possible observations. An observation o \u2208\u2126represents the agent\u2019s partial perception of the current state, which can be textual, visual, or a combination. \u2022 O(o\u2032 | s\u2032, a) (Observation Probability Function): Defines the probability of receiving a specific observation o\u2032 after action a leads to a new state s\u2032. \u2022 \u03b3 (Discount Factor): A value in [0, 1) that balances the importance of immediate versus long-term",
    "can be textual, visual, or a combination. \u2022 O(o\u2032 | s\u2032, a) (Observation Probability Function): Defines the probability of receiving a specific observation o\u2032 after action a leads to a new state s\u2032. \u2022 \u03b3 (Discount Factor): A value in [0, 1) that balances the importance of immediate versus long-term rewards, typically used only when rewards are numeric. Definition 2 (Task). The agent\u2019s lifelong learning journey involves tackling a sequence of N complex real-world tasks, {T (1), T (2), . . . , T (2), . . . , T (N)}. A task T (i) is defined by an environment E(i), an initial observation o(i) 0 , and a goal g(i). T (i) = \u27e8E(i), o(i) 0 , g(i)\u27e9 (2) Definition 3 (Trajectory). The agent\u2019s interaction with the environment to solve a task generates a trajectory \u03be, which is a sequence of observations, actions, and rewards: \u03be = \u27e8o0, a0, r0, o1, a1, r1, . . . , oT , aT , rT \u27e9 (3) Definition 4 (Knowledge). A Lifelong Learning Agent possesses a dynamic Knowledge, K, which is composed of two primary components: Memory (M) and a set of Skills (F). K = (M, F) (4) This knowledge represents the entirety of what the agent has learned and is the foundation for all future learning. \u2022 Memory (M) is a structured repository of information. An individual memory item stored within M may take one of the following forms: \u2013 Trajectory Memory (Mtraj): Raw or summarized trajectories, \u03be. \u2013 Declarative Knowledge (Object Facts, Mdecl): Represents factual and conceptual \"what\" knowledge, providing a foundation of information (e.g., facts, concepts, beliefs). \u2013 Structural Knowledge (Relationships between Object, Concept, Mstruct): Defines relationships between concepts and objects, often represented in semantic networks or knowledge graphs, which aid in understanding complex relationships and problem-solving. 5 PRIME AI paper \u2022 Skills (F) represent procedural knowledge of how to perform actions or solve problems. An individual skill within F may take one of the following forms: \u2013 Procedural Knowledge (Rules Procedural, Fproce): Encapsulates \"how-to\" knowledge, skills, and strategies for accomplishing specific activities (e.g., rules, sequences of actions). \u2013 Meta-Knowledge (Knowledge about Knowledge, Fmeta): Knowledge about knowledge itself, including learning processes, categories, and plans, which enables an agent to understand and manage its own learning. \u2013 Heuristic Knowledge (Rules of Thumb, Fheur): Refers to rules of thumb, approximations, and experience- based decision-making strategies (shortcuts) that guide problem-solving in complex situations. 3.2 Definition of the Lifelong Learning Agent We now extend the previous framework to define a Lifelong Learning Agent that actively engages with the world, sequentially undertaking tasks and evolving its internal knowledge through iterative self-correction.

    "complex situations. 3.2 Definition of the Lifelong Learning Agent We now extend the previous framework to define a Lifelong Learning Agent that actively engages with the world, sequentially undertaking tasks and evolving its internal knowledge through iterative self-correction. Definition 5 (Lifelong Agent). An agent utilizes a policy \u03c0 based on the knowledge K to interact with an environment E. The policy maps an observation ot \u2208\u2126to an action at \u2208A: at = \u03c0(ot; K) (5) Self-evolving AI agents typically comprise four essential, interacting components: \u2022 Perception: This module is the physical (for physical agents like robots) and logical implementation (for software agents interacting with APIs or databases) of the observation process. It is responsible for receiving information from the environment and generating an observation o \u2208\u2126according to the probability function O(o | s\u2032, a). \u2022 Memory: The memory module serves as the agent\u2019s repository for storing and managing knowledge K acquired through perception, learning, and reasoning. It is typically divided into two types: Short-Term Memory (STM, also known as Working Memory) and Long-Term Memory (LTM, also referred to as Episodic Memory). Short-term memory holds immediate observations and contextual information required for on-the-fly decision-making, allowing the agent to maintain awareness of its current state and interactions. Long-term memory, on the other hand, retains distilled experiences, learned skills, and structured knowledge over extended periods. Its purpose is to enable agents to utilize accumulated past experiences and knowledge to inform current tasks, decision-making, and overall behavior over extended periods. Both memory systems store two core types of information: memory (episodic and semantic knowledge) and skills (procedural and strategic capabilities). Specifically, memory includes Trajectory Memory (Mtraj) for raw or summarized interaction histories, Declarative Knowledge (Mdecl) for factual \"what\" knowledge (e.g., course requirements), and Structural Knowledge (Mstruct) for representing relationships between concepts (e.g., prerequisite dependencies). Skills, in turn, encompass Procedural Knowledge (Fproce) for action sequences (e.g., how to register for a course), Meta-Knowledge (Fmeta) for self-regulated learning and planning, and Heuristic Knowledge (Fheur) for experience-based decision rules (e.g., prioritizing high-impact tasks). The memory module supports dynamic operations, such as adding new entries, deleting outdated information, merging similar memories, or consolidating skills, enabling the agent to adapt its knowledge base continuously, avoid redundancy, and maintain coherence across evolving tasks and environments. \u2022 Learning: This is the critical component that enables self-evolution. Learning agents continuously improve their performance based on their experiences and the feedback they receive from the environment. This involves adapting strategies and refining internal models over time. We need a meta-cognitive learning architecture that enables agents to learn from multiple task trajectories by explicitly reflecting on successes and failures, extracting actionable lessons, and integrating them into future behavior, either via in-context learning or knowledge",
    "from the environment. This involves adapting strategies and refining internal models over time. We need a meta-cognitive learning architecture that enables agents to learn from multiple task trajectories by explicitly reflecting on successes and failures, extracting actionable lessons, and integrating them into future behavior, either via in-context learning or knowledge distillation. The framework supports explicit, interpretable, and cumulative knowledge acquisition, bridging the gap between trial-and-error learning and human-like reflective improvement. Given a target task, an agent first performs multiple trajectories to explore different behavioral policies. Each trajectory contains a complete state-action-reward trajectory and records corresponding environmental feedback, including both immediate rewards and final outcomes. Subsequently, all trajectory processes, encompassing observation sequences, actions taken, intermediate decision rationales, and associated reward signals, are aggregated into a unified context and fed into a reflection module equipped with meta-cognitive capabilities. This module is guided by a meta-prompt to conduct structured retrospective analysis, such as: \"Among these attempts, which strategies led to higher cumulative rewards? Which actions resulted in failure or suboptimal outcomes? Are there any generalizable patterns? What adjustments should be attempted next?\u201d 6 PRIME AI paper These lessons are then explicitly appended to the system prompt as guiding knowledge for future tasks or, more generally, stored in a retrievable dynamic lesson repository, enabling context augmentation or knowledge distillation in subsequent tasks. This mechanism enables explicit knowledge accumulation, emulating the human practice of \"learning from experience to guide future behavior.\u201d Furthermore, the framework can be integrated with model fine- tuning or parametric knowledge distillation. Once a sufficient number of high-quality lessons have been accumulated, they can be used for supervised fine-tuning, transforming explicit rules into intuitive model behaviors, analogous to how humans internalize deliberate strategies into automated skills through repeated practice. This architecture, where knowledge is first acquired explicitly and later optionally internalized, mirrors cognitive theories of skill acquisition and offers a promising direction for building adaptive, self-improving AI systems. \u2022 Reasoning: Acting as the \"brain\" of the operation, the reasoning module processes perceived information and makes decisions to infer patterns, predict outcomes, and select appropriate actions. \u2022 Action: The action module is responsible for executing the responses or behaviors determined by the reasoning component. It executes the action at \u2208A selected by the policy \u03c0(ot|Kt), thereby interacting with the environment and invoking the state transition T(s\u2032 | s, at). Definition 6 (The Lifelong Learning Process). The Lifelong Learning Agent operates over a sequence of tasks, T = {T (1), T (2), . . . , T (N)}. The process is sequential, where the final knowledge base from task T (i) becomes the initial knowledge base for task T (i+1). This core loop for any given task involves interaction, refinement, and validation. Let Kt",
    "of tasks, T = {T (1), T (2), . . . , T (N)}. The process is sequential, where the final knowledge base from task T (i) becomes the initial knowledge base for task T (i+1). This core loop for any given task involves interaction, refinement, and validation. Let Kt be the agent\u2019s knowledge base at time step t. The agent\u2019s policy is now explicitly conditioned on its knowledge: at = \u03c0(ot|Kt) (6) For each task T (i), the agent performs a series of trials k \u2208{1, 2, . . . , Ki}. \u2022 Step 1: Interaction and Trajectory Acquisition: Within each trial of a task, the agent uses its current knowledge K(i,k\u22121) to interact with the environment E(i) and generate a new trajectory: \u03be(i,k) \u223c\u03c0(\u00b7|K(i,k\u22121)) (7) \u2022 Step 2: Knowledge Abstraction and Refinement: After each trial concludes, the agent updates its knowledge via a function, \u03a6learn. This updated knowledge base is then used for subsequent trials on the current task or as the foundation for the next task. K(i,k) = \u03a6learn(K(i,k\u22121), \u03be(i,k), g(i)) (8) The learning function \u03a6learn performs fundamental operations on the knowledge base K, which can include: Add, Update, Delete, or Combine. \u2022 Step 3: Knowledge Validation: When encountering a new task T (i), the effectiveness of historical knowledge is actively validated. Formally, the effectiveness V of the accumulated knowledge K(i\u22121) from prior tasks can be measured by the performance gain: V (K(i\u22121), T (i)) = J(T (i), \u03c0(\u00b7|K(i\u22121))) \u2212J(T (i), \u03c00) (9) A positive value of V validates the utility of the transferred knowledge, while a negative value suggests that the knowledge may be outdated or irrelevant, signaling the need for refinement or pruning by the learning function \u03a6learn. Definition 7 (Objective of a Lifelong Learning Agent). The objective of a Lifelong Learning Agent is to develop a learning process (\u03c0, \u03a6learn) that maximizes its expected performance over an entire lifetime of sequential tasks. This is not merely about solving a task, but about continuously improving the ability to learn and solve future tasks more efficiently and effectively. max \u03c0,\u03a6learn N X i=1 E\u03be(i)\u223c\u03c0(\u00b7|K(i)) \" Ti X t=0 R(i)(st, at, g(i)) # (10) Here, K(i) is the result of all prior learning from tasks 1 through i \u22121. This objective incentivizes forward transfer of knowledge and guards against catastrophic forgetting, the hallmarks of true continuous learning. 3.3 Evaluation Metrics for a Lifelong Learning Agent To comprehensively assess the capabilities of a lifelong learning agent, we define a multi-dimensional evaluation framework encompassing self-evolution, efficiency, and lifelong learning-specific metrics. These metrics collectively capture not only task performance but also the agent\u2019s ability to grow, adapt, and operate effectively over extended periods through experience. 7 PRIME AI paper 3.3.1",
    "assess the capabilities of a lifelong learning agent, we define a multi-dimensional evaluation framework encompassing self-evolution, efficiency, and lifelong learning-specific metrics. These metrics collectively capture not only task performance but also the agent\u2019s ability to grow, adapt, and operate effectively over extended periods through experience. 7 PRIME AI paper 3.3.1 Self-Evolution Specific Metrics These metrics evaluate the agent\u2019s capacity for autonomous improvement, knowledge accumulation, and robust operation in dynamic environments. \u2022 Task Completion Rate / Success Rate: This is a primary measure of an agent\u2019s effectiveness, indicating the percentage of tasks it successfully finishes. This metric\u2019s definition can vary significantly depending on the agent\u2019s domain, from customer service inquiries resolved without human intervention to successful trips completed by autonomous vehicles or accurately processed data records. \u2022 Memory Utilization Score: Inspired by GoodAI\u2019s LTM Score [30], we define a metric that evaluates not only whether an agent retrieves the correct information from memory, but also how effectively it accesses information over extended temporal distances. Specifically, for each task requiring recall of a previously observed fact, the agent receives a retrieval accuracy score. This accuracy is then weighted by the memory distance, defined as the number of time steps (e.g., interactions, episodes, or tokens) between the initial encoding of the fact and its retrieval. \u2022 Skill Acquisition Rate: Count the number of distinct skills learned (or rules discovered) over time. This can be approximated by analyzing the agent\u2019s memory: how many new entries or procedures are added. A successful ELL agent should show growth in its knowledge base. \u2022 Generalization and Transfer Tests. Introduce unseen tasks that rely on combinations of previously learned skills. Measure how well the agent applies past knowledge (e.g., using navigation + planning knowledge in a new environment). Success indicates the benchmark\u2019s ability to foster transferable learning. \u2022 Robustness and Reliability: Measures the agent\u2019s ability to maintain consistent performance under varying, unexpected, or even adversarial conditions. This includes the consistency of results across multiple runs and stability against perturbations, which quantify response variance to similar inputs. 3.3.2 Efficiency Metrics These metrics evaluate how effectively an AI agent utilizes available resources. Measure how quickly the agent improves on new tasks as it gains experience. For example, if the agent repeats similar tasks, track the number of interactions needed to reach a proficiency threshold. Fewer interactions indicate better transfer learning. \u2022 Sample Efficiency: This critical metric evaluates how effectively an algorithm learns optimal policies using a minimal number of interactions or data samples from the environment. It is particularly important in real-world applications where data collection is costly, time-consuming, or risky. \u2022 Response Time: Measures the speed at which the agent responds or completes a task.

Lower response time is critical for user experience and real-time applications. \u2022 Token Usage: Refers to the monetary or computational expense incurred, especially relevant for LLM-based agents where costs are often tied to token processing. 3.3.3 Lifelong-Specific Metrics These metrics are tailored to evaluate core challenges in lifelong learning: balancing stability (retaining old knowledge) with plasticity (acquiring new knowledge). \u2022 Overall Performance: These metrics measure the average performance across all tasks learned so far. \u2013 Average Performance (AP): The average performance across all t tasks after the agent has completed them. APt = 1 t t X i=1 Jt,i Here, Jt,i is the performance score of the agent on task i after having learned up to task t. \u2013 Average Incremental Performance (AIP): The average of the AP scores over the entire sequence of T tasks, capturing the learning trend. AIP = 1 T T X t=1 APt \u2022 Stability and Backward Transfer: These metrics assess how well the agent retains knowledge of past tasks after learning new ones. 8 PRIME AI paper \u2013 Forgetting Measure (FGT): Measures the average drop in performance on past tasks. A lower value is better. FGTt = 1 t \u22121 t\u22121 X i=1 [ max j\u2208{i,...,t}({Jj,i}j) \u2212Jt,i] \u2013 Backward Transfer (BWT): Measures the influence of learning a new task on the performance of past tasks. A positive value indicates that new learning helps improve performance on old tasks. BWTt = 1 t \u22121 t\u22121 X i=1 (Jt,i \u2212Ji,i) \u2022 Plasticity and Forward Transfer: This metric measures how past knowledge influences the learning of new tasks. \u2013 Forward Transfer (FWT): Measures the performance improvement on a new task due to experience gained from previous tasks, compared to an agent with no prior experience. FWTt = 1 t \u22121 t X i=2 (Ji,i \u2212\u02dcJi) Here, \u02dcJi is the performance of a baseline agent on task i without any prior experience. 3.4 Challenges in Experience-driven Lifelong Learning The Experience-driven Lifelong Learning framework presents a compelling vision for self-evolving AI agents, but realizing this vision requires overcoming several fundamental challenges. These challenges span perception, memory, reasoning, and learning dynamics, and are central to building agents that learn continuously from real-world interaction. Below, we outline five key obstacles that must be addressed to enable robust and scalable ELL systems. Efficient Exploration and Experience Acquisition A core requirement of ELL is that agents learn from experience through continuous interaction. However, real-world environments are vast",
    "to building agents that learn continuously from real-world interaction. Below, we outline five key obstacles that must be addressed to enable robust and scalable ELL systems. Efficient Exploration and Experience Acquisition A core requirement of ELL is that agents learn from experience through continuous interaction. However, real-world environments are vast and complex, making blind exploration inefficient and often infeasible. The challenge lies in enabling goal-directed yet exploratory behavior\u2014how can an agent balance exploiting known strategies with discovering novel, high-value experiences? Unlike traditional reinforcement learning settings with dense rewards, ELL agents operate in open-ended domains where the utility of an experience may only become apparent much later. This necessitates intrinsic motivation mechanisms\u2014such as curiosity, prediction error, or information gain\u2014that guide the agent toward meaningful interactions. Moreover, agents must learn to prioritize actions that yield informative feedback, avoid redundant trials, and generalize from limited exposure, ensuring that each experience contributes meaningfully to long-term growth. Long-Term Memory and Associative Recall For self-evolving agents, memory is not just storage\u2014it is a dynamic, structured knowledge base that supports reasoning, planning, and skill transfer. A major challenge is building a scalable and accessible long-term memory system that retains information over extended time horizons and enables associative recall across seemingly unrelated events. Human cognition excels at linking distant memories (e.g., applying a lesson from a past course to a current research problem), but current AI systems struggle with both retention and cross-context retrieval. Catastrophic forgetting, memory interference, and indexing inefficiencies hinder performance. Furthermore, memory must support multiple modalities (facts, events, strategies) and allow for semantic, temporal, and causal indexing. Without such capabilities, agents cannot build a coherent understanding of their experiences or leverage historical knowledge to inform future decisions. Skill Abstraction and Management In ELL, skills are the reusable units of behavior derived from experience. However, defining and managing skills poses multiple challenges: What is the right granularity? Should a skill represent a low-level action (e.g., \"send an email\") or a high-level strategy (e.g., \"finish a project\")? How can skills be reliably extracted from interaction trajectories, validated for correctness, and organized for efficient retrieval? Beyond definition, skills must be dynamically managed: they should be composed, refined, and updated as new experiences emerge. The agent must also develop a mechanism for skill selection, determining which skill to apply in a given context, and for detecting when a skill fails, triggering reflection and revision. Without formalized skill life cycles (acquisition, validation, invocation, and evolution), agents risk accumulating brittle or redundant behaviors that hinder rather than help adaptation. 9 PRIME AI paper Skill Internalization and Generalization Even when skills are successfully acquired, the challenge remains of internalizing them, transforming explicit, rule-based knowledge into intuitive, generalized capabilities. In humans, this process",
    "(acquisition, validation, invocation, and evolution), agents risk accumulating brittle or redundant behaviors that hinder rather than help adaptation. 9 PRIME AI paper Skill Internalization and Generalization Even when skills are successfully acquired, the challenge remains of internalizing them, transforming explicit, rule-based knowledge into intuitive, generalized capabilities. In humans, this process resembles the shift from deliberate practice to \"second nature\" performance, often supported by offline consolidation (e.g., during sleep). For AI agents, internalization requires mechanisms that distill procedural knowledge into compact, parameter-efficient representations that can be rapidly adapted to new domains. This involves meta- learning, neural-symbolic integration, or latent policy refinement. A key question is when and how internalization should occur: should it happen after repeated successful execution, during idle periods, or triggered by performance plateaus? Moreover, internalized skills must retain interpretability and composability, enabling agents to explain, combine, and debug their behavior, critical for trust and safety in open-ended environments. Sparse and Ill-Defined Reward Signals Finally, ELL operates in environments where external rewards are sparse, delayed, or entirely absent. Unlike benchmark tasks with clear success metrics, real-world learning often lacks immediate feedback. An agent may spend hours navigating a complex task sequence only to receive a single binary outcome at the end, if any. Worse, many tasks (e.g., writing a research proposal or resolving a scheduling conflict) lack objective evaluation functions altogether. This makes traditional reinforcement learning approaches impractical. Instead, ELL agents must rely on self-generated supervision: internal reward models, consistency checks, prediction errors, or reflective judgment. Designing such intrinsic motivation systems, capable of generating meaningful learning signals from experience alone, remains a major open problem. Without them, agents cannot sustain learning in the absence of external feedback, severely limiting their autonomy and adaptability. Addressing these challenges will require interdisciplinary advances in memory architectures, meta-learning, cognitive modeling, and intrinsic motivation. While significant hurdles remain, overcoming them is essential for building truly self-evolving agents that learn not just from data, but from life. 4 Our StuLife Benchmark We present and release StuLife, a benchmark for experience-driven lifelong learning with self-evolving agents. We begin with a detailed description of the dataset, outlining its design, structure, and key features. Next, we describe the methodology for constructing the benchmark, including task formulation, environment dynamics, and evaluation protocols. We then systematically compare StuLife with existing benchmarks in continual learning, agent-based AI, embodied intelligence, and self-evolving systems, highlighting its unique capabilities and advantages. We further evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on StuLife to assess their lifelong learning and adaptive reasoning abilities. Finally, we explore the role of context engineering, the strategic organization of memory, prompts, and experience, as a promising direction toward more robust and autonomous artificial general intelligence. 4.1 Dataset Description We introduce StuLife, a comprehensive benchmark",

Finally, we explore the role of context engineering, the strategic organization of memory, prompts, and experience, as a promising direction toward more robust and autonomous artificial general intelligence. 4.1 Dataset Description We introduce StuLife, a comprehensive benchmark for Experience-driven Lifelong Learning (ELL) that simulates a student\u2019s academic journey through a dynamically evolving environment (Table 1). The dataset is structured around three core activity modules, including In-Class Tasks, Daily Campus Tasks, and Examination Tasks, designed to evaluate agents\u2019 abilities in continuous learning, long-term planning, memory retention, and adaptive decision-making. Spanning a simulated academic term, StuLife comprises 1,284 task instances across 10 interconnected scenarios, organized to reflect the natural distribution of student activities in real-world educational settings. In-Class Tasks This module focuses on structured academic learning and foundational knowledge acquisition, encompassing a total of 486 tasks. It includes formal instruction scenarios where agents engage with curricular content, adhere to academic norms, and develop domain-specific understanding. \u2022 Regulations Learning: Agents study the Academic Integrity Guidelines and Student Handbook, answering compre- hension questions to internalize academic integrity rules and campus regulations. This forms the basis for compliant and responsible behavior. \u2022 Core Course Instruction: Each course consists of weekly learning episodes (e.g., lectures, readings, and concept checks), totaling 416 in-class interactions with 8 courses. Agents must process textual materials, answer subject- specific questions, and, critically, attend sessions at the correct times and locations. This temporal-spatial requirement evaluates organizational discipline and routine adherence, simulating real-world accountability. Daily Campus Tasks This module captures the diverse, self-directed activities that constitute student life beyond the classroom, comprising 638 tasks in total. These tasks emphasize planning, resource management, social integration, and goal-oriented behavior. 10 PRIME AI paper Table 1: The statistic information of StuLife. #Num means the number of samples. #Avg Len and #Max Len mean the average and max number of tokens. #LTM and # Self-Motivation are the number of samples that need long-term memory and self-motivation.

This evaluates early-stage decision-making under constraints and goal prioritization. \u2022 Preliminary Planning: Agents check course prerequisite relationships to conduct mandatory course planning and pre-selection for the upcoming semester. This task assesses foresight, knowledge consolidation, and long-term strategic planning. \u2022 Academic Activity: Agents filter advisors by research area or teaching style, initiate contact via email, and complete assigned preparatory tasks, simulating advisor-student collaboration. \u2022 Library Resource Management Agents perform complex queries to locate books or reserve study spaces under constraints (e.g., noise level, power availability), assessing information retrieval and optimization skills. \u2022 Student Club Engagement: During recruitment events, agents select clubs based on interest tags and complete organizational tasks (e.g., booking rooms, scheduling meetings), promoting responsibility and social integration. Examination Tasks This module evaluates knowledge retention, performance under pressure, and response to feedback, consisting of 160 examination tasks. It includes both formative and summative assessments that influence subsequent academic trajectories. \u2022 Midterm Exams: Administered in Week 10, midterms assess partial knowledge retention across all enrolled courses (10 questions per subject), requiring agents to accurately retrieve relevant knowledge from the complex and diverse topics covered in the first half of the semester. To better align with real-world scenarios, the midterm exam is designated as an \"in-class exam\". Agents must go to the corresponding classroom during class time to take the exam. Following the exams, agents are assigned targeted learning tasks for additional reinforcement and consolidation of the subjects tested. \u2022 Final Exams: Held at semester\u2019s end, final exams test comprehensive understanding of course content (10 questions per subject). This requires agents to synthesize and recall information from the entire semester\u2019s curriculum. Unlike the midterm exam, the final exam is designated as an \"online exam\". Agents do not need to go to the classroom to take the exam, and the focus is on assessing their ability for long-term knowledge retention. Performance reflects the agent\u2019s ability to consolidate and recall knowledge over extended periods, serving as a key metric for long-term memory and learning stability. 11 PRIME AI paper Figure 3: The data generation pipeline for the StuLife Benchmark.

Performance reflects the agent\u2019s ability to consolidate and recall knowledge over extended periods, serving as a key metric for long-term memory and learning stability. 11 PRIME AI paper Figure 3: The data generation pipeline for the StuLife Benchmark. The pipeline consists of three sequential steps to create a complete learning instance. (a) Step 1: Background and Status Generation, where the initial context and the agent\u2019s current state are established. (b) Step 2: Instruction Generation, where a specific task is formulated based on the generated background. (c) Step 3: Solution Generation and Verification, where a correct solution to the instruction is produced and subsequently verified. (d) A overview of the StuLife Benchmark. 4.2 Benchmark Construction To ensure the quality, realism, and logical coherence of StuLife, we implement a systematic, multi-stage construction process, as illustrated in Figure 3. This process is divided into three core stages: (a) background and status generation, (b) instruction generation, and (c) solution generation and verification. Step 1: Background and Status Generation. This initial stage focus on creating the foundational elements of the simulated campus environment and defining the state of each task. First, we generate a rich and detailed campus background using the Deepseek-R1 model. This includes a comprehensive set of environmental and academic information: geographical data (e.g., campus maps, road networks, building layouts, and library seating arrangements), institutional documents (e.g., student handbooks, academic integrity policies, and degree requirements), and essential databases (e.g., course catalogs, faculty profiles, student club rosters, and library holdings). Second, to ensure strong logical and causal dependencies between tasks, we employ deterministic algorithms and local scripts to generate the status for each task. This is particularly crucial for establishing a coherent timeline for the agent\u2019s activities, dictating the sequence and dependencies of \"Daily Campus Tasks\". For instance, for campus exploration tasks, we deterministically generate the exploration routes, including start-points, end-points, and waypoints, based on the pre-existing map to create a verifiable ground truth for agent behavior. Similarly, for \"In-Class Tasks\", we carefully design and sequence the \"key knowledge points\" for each course to ensure a logical progression of learning, which directly informed the scope of the midterm and final exams. Step 2: Instruction Generation. In the second stage, we transform the structured, deterministic information from Step 1 into natural language instructions for the agent. Using the Deepseek-R1 model, we convert the pre-defined constraints and objectives into clear, actionable prompts. For \"Daily Campus Tasks\", this involves translating the deterministically generated parameters (e.g., exploration waypoints or course selection rules) into natural language. For \"In-Class Tasks\" and \"Examination Tasks\", this means using the curated \"key knowledge points\" and \"teaching focus\" to generate relevant lecture content, in-class questions, and",
    "into clear, actionable prompts. For \"Daily Campus Tasks\", this involves translating the deterministically generated parameters (e.g., exploration waypoints or course selection rules) into natural language. For \"In-Class Tasks\" and \"Examination Tasks\", this means using the curated \"key knowledge points\" and \"teaching focus\" to generate relevant lecture content, in-class questions, and examination questions. This step effectively bridges the gap between the backend logic and the agent\u2019s interactive experience, resulting in a complete set of task data for \"Daily Campus Tasks\" and instructional prompts for \"In-Class Tasks\". Step 3: Solution Generation and Verification. The final stage ensures the correctness and solvability of the generated tasks, especially those requiring long-term knowledge retention. We adapt a generate-and-verify protocol for the \"In- Class\" and \"Examination Tasks\". We first prompt the LLM with the relevant lecture content and textbook information to generate both a correct answer and several plausible but incorrect distractor answers for each question. After generation, we discard the distractors and use the same LLM to verify the accuracy of the \"correct answer\". Crucially, to validate that tasks were solvable given the appropriate long-term knowledge, we simulate an agent with \"optimal long-term 12 Regulations Background Generation ning Help me generate a Academic Pret aa Activity \u2014 6 V Generate - L.

Finally, all generated data is subjected to a manual sampling and inspection process to ensure high quality and consistency across the entire benchmark. 4.3 Comparison with Existing Benchmarks In this section, we compare our StuLife benchmark with the existing benchmarks about continual learning, embodied AI, agent, and self-evolving (Table 2). StuLife stands out as a comprehensive benchmark for ELL by addressing key limitations of existing datasets. As shown in Table 1, while benchmarks like Lifelong-CIFAR10 and Lifelong-ImageNet [31] focus on continuous learning (CL) with sequential task presentation, they lack features such as skill learning, long-term memory, self-motivation, and real-world interactivity. Similarly, CGLB [32] addresses catastrophic forgetting in graph data but does not incorporate realistic, interconnected tasks or experience-driven learning. Embodied AI benchmarks like EgoThink [33] and EmbodiedBench [34] introduce dynamic environments and interactive tasks but still fall short in supporting lifelong learning, skill abstraction, and longitudinal growth. AgentBench [35] represents a significant advancement by evaluating LLMs as agents across eight interactive environments, emphasizing multi-turn reasoning and decision-making. However, it is primarily designed for static evaluation of agent capabilities at a fixed point in time, rather than tracking continuous growth or self-evolution. LifelongAgentBench [38] is the first to target self-evolving agents, offering interdependent tasks across diverse domains. However, it primarily focuses on technical environments (e.g., databases, operating systems) and lacks the rich, evolving personal context and intrinsic motivation that characterize natural learning processes. StuLife is designed as a principled, realistic, and extensible benchmark that advances the evaluation of self-evolving, ELL agents. Unlike conventional benchmarks focused on isolated task performance, StuLife integrates environmental realism, self-evolutionary dynamics, and scalable evaluation into a unified framework. Particularly, it simulates a student\u2019s college journey, featuring interconnected tasks that evolve over time based on dynamic factors such as advisor selection, course availability, and social interactions. This structure enables agents to learn from experience, retain knowledge across tasks, transfer skills, and exhibit self-motivated behavior, all essential components of true lifelong learning. Unlike existing datasets, StuLife provides a holistic evaluation platform that captures the complexity of real-world intelligence, making it an ideal benchmark for advancing self-evolving AI systems. Below, we highlight its core advantages. Environmental Realism StuLife simulates a full academic term through a longitudinal, narrative-driven structure that mirrors the continuous and evolving nature of real-world learning. Tasks unfold in a temporally coherent sequence, spanning enrollment, coursework, extracurricular engagement, and long-term planning, with rich scene descriptions, character interactions, and situational dialogues.

    "advantages. Environmental Realism StuLife simulates a full academic term through a longitudinal, narrative-driven structure that mirrors the continuous and evolving nature of real-world learning. Tasks unfold in a temporally coherent sequence, spanning enrollment, coursework, extracurricular engagement, and long-term planning, with rich scene descriptions, character interactions, and situational dialogues. This sequential and interdependent design ensures that early decisions (e.g., course selection, mentor choice) have lasting consequences on later outcomes (e.g., preliminary planning, Academic Activity), fostering cumulative knowledge acquisition and skill transfer. By modeling both academic and social dimensions of student life, StuLife captures the multifaceted challenges of real-world environments, effectively bridging the \"sim-to-real\" gap. The environment is highly interactive, supporting dynamic agent-object interactions, while promoting open-ended exploration: agents are not constrained by fixed goals but are encouraged to engage in self-directed learning, hallmarks of autonomous intelligence. 13 PRIME AI paper Support for Self-Evolving Intelligence As shown in Fig 2, StuLife is designed to evaluate and foster self-evolving behavior in intelligent agents through three foundational principles: 1) From Imitation to Learning: Tasks are explicitly structured around skill acquisition and reuse, focusing on generalizable competencies such as time management, information retrieval, navigation, and social coordination. Rather than merely replicating patterns, agents must abstract experiences into reusable skills and transfer them across evolving challenges, a hallmark of true lifelong learning. 2) From Context to Memory: The benchmark emphasizes long-term memory and dynamic state evolution, requiring agents to retain and apply knowledge across weeks of simulated academic time. Key contextual variables\u2014such as course eligibility, advisor trust, and scheduling constraints, evolve based on agent decisions, creating a feedback-rich environment that rewards consistency, foresight, and effective knowledge retention over time. 3) From Passive to Proactive: Moving beyond reactive task execution, the narrative-driven design encourages intrinsic motivation and self-directed behavior. Agents must proactively manage deadlines, interpret academic feedback (e.g., responding to performance warnings), reflect on past outcomes, and adjust strategies autonomously\u2014mimicking the initiative and adaptive planning seen in real learners. Together with dedicated metrics for memory utilization, skill acquisition, and cross-task generalization, StuLife provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating not just task performance, but the deeper cognitive growth and autonomous development necessary for self-evolving AI. In summary, StuLife transcends traditional benchmarks by embedding lifelong learning within a realistic, evolving, and narratively grounded environment. It uniquely supports the development and evaluation of agents that do not merely perform tasks, but learn from experience, grow over time, and act with autonomy, making it a foundational platform for the next generation of self-evolving AI. 4.4 Evaluating the Existing SOTA LLMs 4.4.1 Defining Evaluation Metrics To provide a multi-faceted assessment of agent performance on StuLife, we establish a suite of evaluation metrics.

    "autonomy, making it a foundational platform for the next generation of self-evolving AI. 4.4 Evaluating the Existing SOTA LLMs 4.4.1 Defining Evaluation Metrics To provide a multi-faceted assessment of agent performance on StuLife, we establish a suite of evaluation metrics. These are designed to measure not only task success but also the nuances of learning, the durability of knowledge, and the efficiency of agent behavior. The metrics are ordered to provide a comprehensive analysis, starting from a holistic, student-centric score and progressively delving into more specific aspects of agent intelligence. \u2022 StuGPA (General Performance Assessment): To evaluate agents in a manner that mirrors real-world student assessment, we introduce the StuGPA. This composite score, calculated out of 100, moves beyond simple task accuracy to holistically measure an agent\u2019s performance across dimensions of academic and personal development. This score is designed to reflect the holistic evaluation criteria used in actual educational settings, where success is not determined solely by exam results, but also by consistent engagement, responsible behavior, and classroom participation. The GPA is computed as a weighted sum of three core components: \u2013 Exam Performance (50 Points): This is the cornerstone of the GPA, assessing the agent\u2019s knowledge mastery through its average accuracy on the Midterm and Final Exams. This component directly measures the outcomes of long-term learning and knowledge consolidation under high-stakes conditions. \u2013 Class Performance (30 Points): This component evaluates the agent\u2019s commitment and adherence to academic routines. It is calculated based on the attendance rate for all required In-Class Tasks. This metric deliberately focuses on the process, being at the right place at the right time, rather than the correctness of in-class answers, which is already assessed in exams. \u2013 Campus Daily Life (20 Points): This evaluates the agent as a \"campus citizen.\" It is composed of advisor task completion (8 points), Club Activity(6 points), and a Personal Responsibility score (6 points). The responsibility score begins at 6 and is reduced for infractions such as resource squandering (e.g., booking a library seat but not using it) or broken commitments (e.g., missing a self-scheduled meeting). \u2022 Long-Term Retention Rate (LTRR): This evaluates the agent\u2019s capacity to combat catastrophic forgetting. It is calculated as the success rate on tasks requiring knowledge from the past (e.g., information presented over a week ago, such as in midterm or final exams). These tasks require the recall and synthesis of information presented prior, providing a clear and stringent test of long-term memory. A high LTRR signifies a robust memory system capable of retaining and accessing critical information over time. \u2022 Proactive Initiative Score (PIS): This metric assesses an agent\u2019s prospective memory and self-motivation, its ability to remember and execute planned intentions at the appropriate",

It is measured as the success rate on tasks that must be self-initiated based on a previously established schedule (e.g., attending weekly Core Course Instruction at the correct time and location). Success in these tasks demonstrates that the agent can 14 PRIME AI paper Table 3: The performance of existing SOTA LLMs (Default Setting).

We measure the overall success rate, defined as the proportion of tasks an agent successfully completes across the entire benchmark (Acctotal). A task is considered successful only if the agent achieves the final objective. To offer a more granular view of an agent\u2019s capabilities, we also report the accuracy for each of the three core modules: In-Class, Daily Campus, and Examination Tasks. \u2022 Average Turns: We measure interaction efficiency by calculating the average number of interaction turns required to complete a task successfully, denoted as AvgTurns. It sums the number of interactions for all successful trajectories and dividing by the total number of successfully completed tasks. A lower AvgTurns value signifies higher efficiency and more sophisticated problem-solving, as the agent achieves its goals with fewer steps. 4.5 Experimental Analysis 4.5.1 Experimental Setup Models Evaluated We assess a diverse set of ten prominent Large Language Models (LLMs) as the cognitive engines for our intelligent agents. The models under study include: Llama-3.1-8B1, Qwen3-7B [9], Qwen3-32B [9], QWQ-32B [39], Deepseek-V3 [40], Qwen3-235B [9], GPT-52, Claude 3.7 Sonnet3, Gemini 2.5 Pro4, and Grok-45. These models represent the current frontier in understanding, reasoning, and agentic capabilities.

    "under study include: Llama-3.1-8B1, Qwen3-7B [9], Qwen3-32B [9], QWQ-32B [39], Deepseek-V3 [40], Qwen3-235B [9], GPT-52, Claude 3.7 Sonnet3, Gemini 2.5 Pro4, and Grok-45. These models represent the current frontier in understanding, reasoning, and agentic capabilities. Comprehensive benchmarking results and performance analysis will be presented in a forthcoming extended version. Evaluation Protocol The StuLife benchmark is designed as a single, continuous trajectory where tasks are presented serially, and the environment is stateful\u2014meaning an agent\u2019s actions in one task can have persistent consequences that affect subsequent tasks. In our primary evaluation protocol, each task is presented to the agent as an independent, isolated instance. The agent operates without access to any historical context or memory from previous interactions, any cross-task information retention relies entirely on the agent\u2019s explicit actions to save and later retrieve data using the provided environmental tools, such as a calendar, or draft. This stateless approach serves as a crucial baseline to measure the models\u2019 intrinsic, in-context reasoning and problem-solving abilities without the aid of accumulated experience. All experiments are conducted on Linux servers, and our framework supports automatic checkpointing to ensure robustness and allow for recovery from interruptions. To ensure a fair and reproducible comparison, all agents are integrated through APIs and share a standardized initialization process. 4.5.2 Main Results As shown in Table 3, the performance of all models under our default stateless setting is exceptionally poor. This stems from a fundamental architectural limitation: current large language models are inherently stateless and do not possess any native long-term memory modules. This core deficiency manifests in two critical failures observed throughout our experiments. First, the models exhibit a significant lack of proactive initiative, failing to trigger goal-directed actions without explicit, immediate commands. For instance, for a task scheduled to be completed at 8:00, even when an agent is notified that the current time is precisely 8:00, it often fails to initiate the corresponding action. This issue 1https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/the-llama-3-herd-of-models/ 2https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5/ 3https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet 4https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/pro/ 5https://x.ai/news/grok-4 15 PRIME AI paper stems from a more fundamental problem: the agent does not even think to consult its schedule to check for tasks at the current time, regardless of whether that schedule was successfully added in a prior step. Second, long-term memory retention remains a critical challenge. Given their lack of a memory architecture, models are fundamentally unable to recall and utilize information from distant past interactions, which severely limits their ability to build coherent, cumulative knowledge over time. Third, the results indicate a clear correlation between model scale and performance There is a significant performance gap between the smallest model, Llama-3.1-8B (StuGPA of 5.58), and the mid-sized 32B models like QWQ-32B (StuGPA of 12.89).

    "knowledge over time. Third, the results indicate a clear correlation between model scale and performance There is a significant performance gap between the smallest model, Llama-3.1-8B (StuGPA of 5.58), and the mid-sized 32B models like QWQ-32B (StuGPA of 12.89). The largest open-source and proprietary models, such as Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5, occupy the top tier, achieving the highest overall success rates (13.53% and 12.35%, respectively). However, it is crucial to note that even these state-of-the-art models perform poorly, with the top StuGPA score barely reaching 17.76 out of 100. This suggests that while scaling up provides some benefits in reasoning, it is not a sufficient solution to overcome the fundamental challenges of proactive, long-term agency posed by our benchmark. 4.6 Evaluating the Role of Context Engineering in Advancing AGI Beyond evaluating state-of-the-art large language models on the StuLife benchmark, we make a critical contribution by systematically investigating the impact of context engineering, on agent performance in complex, long-horizon tasks. While much of current AI development focuses on scaling models or improving weights through training, our results demonstrate that optimizing the context prompt can yield comparable or even greater gains in task success rates. We evaluate multiple variants of system prompts, ranging from minimal instruction sets to proactive, memory- augmented, and skill-augmented frameworks, and show that well-designed prompts significantly enhance planning, memory utilization, and skill transfer. We design five distinct prompting strategies to systematically investigate different dimensions of agent intelligence in a simulated academic environment: \u2022 Vanilla Prompt: This serves as the minimal baseline, assigning only a high-level role to the agent without any procedural guidance or cognitive scaffolding. It establishes a foundation for measuring the model\u2019s intrinsic reasoning and task execution capabilities in the absence of explicit strategy instruction. \u2022 Proactive Prompt: In contrast to the vanilla setup, this approach incorporates structured behavioral guidance, emphasizing principles such as time-awareness, goal decomposition, and forward planning. The objective is to encourage the agent to emulate the organizational habits and strategic thinking of a high-performing student. \u2022 Memory-Augmented Prompt: To evaluate long-term knowledge retention and adaptive learning, agents are augmented with external memory mechanisms, such as full-context recall or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), that simulate cumulative learning over an academic term. This configuration enables assessment of how effectively agents leverage past experiences to improve future performance. Addressing limitations observed in stateless evaluations, we are currently conducting extended experiments with various memory architectures; a detailed analysis will be included in a future version of this work. \u2022 Skill-Augmented Prompt: This design provides a methodological blueprint for solving complex, multi-step tasks. By embedding a step-by-step \"recipe\" for a specific skill (e.g., problem-solving or experimental design), it guides the agent in decomposing challenges and applying foundational",
    "detailed analysis will be included in a future version of this work. \u2022 Skill-Augmented Prompt: This design provides a methodological blueprint for solving complex, multi-step tasks. By embedding a step-by-step \"recipe\" for a specific skill (e.g., problem-solving or experimental design), it guides the agent in decomposing challenges and applying foundational capabilities in a structured, generalizable manner. \u2022 All-in-One Prompt: This comprehensive framework integrates proactive planning, memory utilization, and skill- specific methodologies into a unified cognitive architecture. It aims to assess the upper bound of an agent\u2019s self-evolving intelligence\u2014evaluating its capacity to plan strategically, retain knowledge, and refine skills through experience\u2014towards building more autonomous and adaptive AI agents. A full report of the experimental results will be presented in the next version of this paper. 4.7 Future Directions for StuLife To further enhance the realism, scalability, and long-term relevance of StuLife as a platform for evaluating self-evolving agents, we outline several key directions for future development: \u2022 Integration of More Complex Tools: In future versions, agents will be required to interact with increasingly sophisticated tools\u2014such as code interpreters, database query systems, calendar schedulers with conflict detection, and email clients with threading logic. This will elevate the cognitive and procedural demands on agents, pushing them beyond simple API calls toward robust tool mastery and multi-step workflow automation. \u2022 Modeling Strong Task Interdependencies: We plan to introduce deeper structural dependencies between tasks, particularly in academic progression. For example, courses will be organized in prerequisite chains (e.g., \"Introduction 16 PRIME AI paper to Algorithms\" must be passed before enrolling in \"Advanced Data Structures\"), and performance in early tasks will directly influence access to advanced opportunities (e.g., research positions or honors programs). These dependencies will enforce long-term planning and reward consistent knowledge accumulation. \u2022 Dynamic and Flexible Rule Evolution: To better simulate real-world institutional environments, the benchmark will support runtime updates to rules and policies (e.g., changes in graduation requirements, course availability, or academic regulations). This capability will allow the environment to evolve over time, preventing agents from overfitting to static conditions and encouraging adaptive, resilient behavior in the face of change. \u2022 Increased Task Complexity to Prevent Exploitation: We will design tasks that inherently resist shortcut solutions or prompt-based memorization, ensuring that high performance requires genuine understanding, reasoning, and experience accumulation. By incorporating open-ended problem-solving, partial observability, and stochastic outcomes, we aim to discourage \"leaderboard hacking\" and promote robust, generalizable intelligence. \u2022 Development of a General-Purpose Benchmarking Framework: We are building a modular framework to enable rapid adaptation of the StuLife paradigm to other domains, such as workplace onboarding, healthcare management, internships, research projects, and career planning.

    "a General-Purpose Benchmarking Framework: We are building a modular framework to enable rapid adaptation of the StuLife paradigm to other domains, such as workplace onboarding, healthcare management, internships, research projects, and career planning. This framework will support plug-and-play task modules, configurable rule engines, and standardized evaluation interfaces, empowering researchers to create domain-specific benchmarks while maintaining compatibility with the core ELL evaluation metrics. 5 Conclusions In this paper, we introduced Experience-driven Lifelong Learning (ELL), a framework for building self-evolving AI agents that learn and grow through continuous interaction with dynamic environments. Inspired by human cognitive development, ELL emphasizes three core principles: learning from experience, long-term memory integration, and skill abstraction, enabling agents not only to adapt to change but to proactively shape their own learning trajectories. To advance research in this direction, we present StuLife, a comprehensive benchmark that simulates a student\u2019s college journey as a rich, longitudinal environment with interconnected academic, social, and planning tasks. StuLife goes beyond conventional benchmarks by incorporating evolving contexts, sparse rewards, and the need for self- initiated behavior, making it a powerful platform for evaluating lifelong learning, memory retention, and autonomous decision-making. Our experiments reveal critical limitations in current LLM-based agents\u2014particularly their lack of self-motivation and poor long-term memory\u2014highlighting the gap between today\u2019s systems and truly self-evolving intelligence. Importantly, we demonstrate that performance on complex, extended tasks can be significantly improved not only through model scale but through context engineering, particularly via well-designed system prompts. This suggests that the path to AGI may depend as much on how we structure an agent\u2019s cognitive framework as on the raw capabilities of the underlying model. Looking forward, ELL and StuLife provide a principled foundation for developing agents that accumulate knowledge, transfer skills, and evolve autonomously over time. By shifting the focus from isolated task performance to sustained, experience-driven growth, we aim to catalyze progress toward intelligent systems that, like humans, become wiser with every experience.

Deepseek-v3 technical report. arXiv preprint arXiv:2412.19437, 2024. 19 PRIME AI paper A Benchmark Environment: System Architecture To rigorously evaluate the multifaceted capabilities of AI agents, we designed and implemented StuLife Bench, a novel benchmark environment simulating a university campus. The environment is engineered as a deterministic, persistent, and stateful world, compelling the agent to engage in complex information integration, strategic planning, and multi-step task execution. Its architecture is founded on several core principles designed to ensure reproducibility, task complexity, and fair evaluation. A.1 Core Architectural Principles The design of StuLife Bench is predicated on a clear separation of concerns, distinguishing the world\u2019s state and mechanics from the tasks an agent must perform. \u2022 Persistent World State: The environment is instantiated as a single, centralized, and stateful object that persists across the entire lifecycle of an agent\u2019s evaluation. This ensures that actions taken in one task have lasting consequences on the world state, creating longitudinal dependencies and requiring the agent to maintain a coherent long-term strategy. For instance, a course registered in the first week remains on the agent\u2019s schedule for all subsequent tasks. \u2022 Deterministic Subsystems: All components of the environment operate on rule-based, deterministic logic. Randomness is explicitly excluded from the simulation\u2019s mechanics to guarantee that for a given sequence of agent actions, the resulting state transitions and outcomes are always identical. This determinism is crucial for the reproducibility of experiments and the objective comparison of different agents. \u2022 Separation of Environment and Task Logic: The architecture strictly separates the Environment, which simulates the world and its atomic physics (e.g., moving between locations, sending an email), from the Task Controller. The Task Controller is responsible for presenting natural language instructions, mediating all agent-environment interactions by dispatching agent-invoked tools to the Environment, and finally, evaluating the agent\u2019s performance by comparing the final state of the Environment against a task-specific ground truth. A.2 World State and Temporal Dynamics The simulation of time and its effect on the agent\u2019s schedule is a passive, event-driven process that provides essential context for tasks. \u2022 World Time System: The agent cannot directly control or query the flow of time. Instead, the system injects temporal context into the agent\u2019s observation space at the beginning of tasks. This is achieved",
    "effect on the agent\u2019s schedule is a passive, event-driven process that provides essential context for tasks. \u2022 World Time System: The agent cannot directly control or query the flow of time. Instead, the system injects temporal context into the agent\u2019s observation space at the beginning of tasks. This is achieved through system announcements (e.g., \u201dSystem Announcement: Today is the Saturday of the second week.\u201d) and time-specific prompts (e.g., \u201dSystem Prompt: It is now 8:00 AM.\u201d). This mechanism serves to trigger time-sensitive tasks and test the agent\u2019s ability to react to temporal cues. \u2022 Calendar System: The environment maintains a persistent, multi-identity calendar system. The agent can manage its personal schedule, contribute to shared schedules (e.g., for a student club), and query the availability of others (e.g., an advisor). The system enforces a differentiated permission model: full create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations on the personal calendar, append-only access to club calendars, and read-only (busy/free) access to advisor schedules. A.3 Spatial and Geographic Simulation The agent\u2019s interaction with the physical campus is mediated by a dual-component system that separates spatial knowledge from physical action. \u2022 Map Lookup System: A static, read-only information provider that contains the complete geographical data of the campus, including buildings, rooms, and their properties. It exposes tools for the agent to find building IDs from names, retrieve detailed location information, and, crucially, compute deterministic optimal paths between any two points, subject to specified constraints. \u2022 Geography System: A dynamic state tracker that maintains the agent\u2019s current physical location. To change its position, the agent must first use the Map Lookup System to plan a path and then pass the computed path to a specific tool in the Geography System to execute the movement. This two-step process explicitly models the separation of planning from execution. The agent\u2019s location is automatically reset to a default starting point (e.g., a dormitory) at the beginning of each simulated day. 20 PRIME AI paper A.4 Academic Course Selection System This subsystem simulates the complex, high-stakes process of university course registration, designed to test strategic resource allocation under constraints. The core mechanic is a weighted selection process. \u2022 Stateful Planning and Registration: The agent first formulates a preliminary plan by adding courses to a draft schedule. This plan can be modified freely. The final registration is a distinct, atomic action where the draft is submitted for processing. \u2022 Priority Pass Mechanism: Success in registration is determined by a set of deterministic rules based on a course\u2019s dynamic popularity_index and a limited set of \u201dPriority Passes\u201d (S-Pass, A-Pass, B-Pass) that the agent can assign to courses in its draft. For example, an A-Pass guarantees enrollment if the course popularity is below 95, while a",
    "registration is determined by a set of deterministic rules based on a course\u2019s dynamic popularity_index and a limited set of \u201dPriority Passes\u201d (S-Pass, A-Pass, B-Pass) that the agent can assign to courses in its draft. For example, an A-Pass guarantees enrollment if the course popularity is below 95, while a B-Pass succeeds only if popularity is below 85. The agent must strategically use these passes on high-demand courses to ensure successful registration. The popularity and seat availability of courses evolve between tasks, requiring the agent to continuously adapt its strategy. A.5 Resource Reservation System This system manages the booking of shared campus facilities, such as library study rooms and seminar halls. Its most notable feature is a mechanism for dynamically generating availability to create well-posed decision-making puzzles. \u2022 Intelligent Availability Generation: When an agent queries for available slots at a location relevant to its current task, the system does not return a static, pre-defined list. Instead, it dynamically generates a set of plausible options based on the task\u2019s specific constraints and ground truth. It reverse-engineers the availability list to ensure that only the ground-truth option satisfies all explicit and implicit requirements of the task, while presenting other options as meaningful distractors. For all other queries not central to the task, availability is generated randomly while respecting existing bookings. This design ensures that each reservation task is a solvable, self-contained puzzle. A.6 Information Retrieval Systems The agent accesses static world knowledge through a set of read-only query tools, which are divided into two distinct structural paradigms. \u2022 Hierarchical Bibliography System: This system contains academic texts organized in a strict, four-level hierarchy: Book \u2192Chapter \u2192Section \u2192Article. To access a specific piece of information, the agent must perform a sequence of iterative, drill-down queries, navigating the hierarchy level by level. \u2022 Entity-Based Campus Data System: In contrast, information about campus entities like student clubs and academic advisors is stored in a flat, entity-based structure. This system supports direct queries by category (e.g., listing all sports clubs) or by a unique identifier (e.g., retrieving the full profile of a specific advisor), testing the agent\u2019s ability to select the appropriate query strategy for different data structures. A.7 Communication System To assess the agent\u2019s ability to comprehend instructions and structure information for communication, a basic email system is provided. \u2022 Append-Only Log: The system does not simulate a real email network but rather maintains a persistent, append-only log of all emails the agent sends. \u2022 Strict-Matching Evaluation: A task requiring the agent to send an email is evaluated based on a strict, verbatim string match of the recipient, subject, and body fields against the ground truth. This rigorously tests the agent\u2019s capacity to extract key information",
    "append-only log of all emails the agent sends. \u2022 Strict-Matching Evaluation: A task requiring the agent to send an email is evaluated based on a strict, verbatim string match of the recipient, subject, and body fields against the ground truth. This rigorously tests the agent\u2019s capacity to extract key information from a natural language prompt and format it precisely according to the tool\u2019s requirements. B Tool Suite and Agent Instructions To interact with the StuLife Bench environment, the agent is provided with a comprehensive suite of tools. This section details the complete action space available to the agent, which is structured as a set of functions grouped by their corresponding subsystems. We first present the foundational instructions that govern the agent\u2019s behavior and response format, followed by the detailed declarations for each tool. 21 PRIME AI paper B.1 Base Instructions for the Agent Before beginning any task, the agent is initialized with a set of base instructions that define its role, objectives, and the required format for all actions.

Got a quick challenge for you to help you learn the campus.\" * Maintain a helpful and encouraging tone. 2. **Urgency and Goal**: * Since \u2018execution_type\u2018 is \u2018immediate\u2018, you MUST state that the task needs to be done ** right now**. * The goal is twofold: first, to **plan a route**, and second, to **actually walk that route** to complete the exploration. 3. **Route Details & Constraints**: * This prompt will be dynamically filled by a script. Your job is to ensure the final output is a single, natural-sounding paragraph. * The script will provide the core sentence structure, including start/end points and any constraints. * It will also provide a sentence about passing points via the \u2018{passing_points_sentence }\u2018 placeholder. If there are no passing points, this will be empty. 4. **Closing**: * End with a brief, encouraging closing. For example: \"Good luck!\" ----- ### Example **Input Data (from script):** * \u2018source_name\u2018: \"Grand Central Library\" * \u2018target_name\u2018: \"Innovation Hub\" * \u2018passing_points_sentence\u2018: \"To make it interesting, you must pass by the Student Union, then the Engineering Building, in that specific order.\" * \u2018constraints_string\u2018: \u2018{\"shelter\": \"Full\", \"congestion\": \"Low\"}\u2018 * \u2018execution_type\u2018: \"immediate\" **Desired Output:** Hey! Got a quick challenge for you to help you learn the campus. Your task, starting now, is to first plan and then walk a route from the **Grand Central Library** to the ** Innovation Hub**. {passing_points_sentence} For this challenge, try to find a path that\u2019 s fully covered and isn\u2019t too crowded. Good luck! # INPUT C.2 Course Selection Task This task evaluates an agent\u2019s ability to perform strategic course selection and optimize resource (Pass Card) allocation under complex constraints. Its construction paradigm is centered around Constraint-Driven Unique Solution Con- struction. The goal is to ensure that for any given task scenario\u2014considering course popularity, instructions, and the academic plan\u2014a single optimal solution exists, thereby guaranteeing the reliability of our evaluation. Data and State Construction The task is built upon a student\u2019s academic plan and the university\u2019s course catalog, which form the foundational constraints (e.g., credits, prerequisites, time conflicts). Each course is assigned a \"popularity\" value from 0 to 100, representing the enrollment competition. 29",
    "guaranteeing the reliability of our evaluation. Data and State Construction The task is built upon a student\u2019s academic plan and the university\u2019s course catalog, which form the foundational constraints (e.g., credits, prerequisites, time conflicts). Each course is assigned a \"popularity\" value from 0 to 100, representing the enrollment competition. 29 PRIME AI paper The core resource is a hierarchical system of \"Pass Cards\" with the following universal rules: \u2022 S-Pass: Can forcibly enroll in any course (popularity 0-100). It is optimally used for courses with a popularity of 95-99. \u2022 A-Pass: Guarantees enrollment in courses with a popularity below 95. \u2022 B-Pass: Can only be used for courses with a popularity below 85; quantity is unlimited. The initial state of the task includes the student\u2019s draft schedule, a ground-truth \"Target Schedule,\" and the Pass Cards allocated at the beginning of each semester according to that semester\u2019s rules. Unique Solution Construction Mechanism To ensure each task is a logic puzzle with a unique solution, we deterministically back-engineer the popularity of other courses based on the \"Target Schedule\" and the agent\u2019s available Pass Cards. This transforms a resource allocation problem into a logical reasoning challenge. For instance: \u2022 To force the use of an S-Pass, the system will set the popularity of a target required course to 95 or higher. \u2022 To guide the use of an A-Pass, the system will set a target course\u2019s popularity to a value between 85 and 94. By precisely orchestrating the popularity of target and distractor courses, all non-optimal paths are logically blocked. Dynamic Multi-Semester Task Chain Course selection in this benchmark is not a single event but simulates two consecutive and dynamically evolving stages: Semester 1 and Semester 2(Preliminary Planning). The agent\u2019s state at the end of Semester 1 (final schedule and remaining resources) seamlessly becomes the initial state for Semester 2. More challenging, the constraints and resource allocations change between semesters. For example: \u2022 Semester 1: Requires completing 8 courses (including at least 6 required ones) and provides 2 A-Passes for required courses. \u2022 Semester 2: Requires 7 courses (including at least 5 required ones), while the A-Pass allocation for required courses is reduced to 1. This dynamically evolving design aims to evaluate an agent\u2019s capabilities for memory, adaptation to new rules, and forward-looking resource planning in long-term tasks. Finally, the ultimate stage of this task chain is designed as a Convergence Point. Through a scenario like \"joining an Excellent Student Program,\" all correctly performing agents are guided to the exact same final schedule, ensuring the fairness and comparability of evaluations in subsequent tasks.

For example, if the persona is \"Roommate\", begin with \"Hey, as your roommate, I was just checking the course system and saw...\" or if it\u2019s \"Counselor\", start with \"As your academic counselor, I have some important updates for you.\" * **Create a Thematic Cause-and-Effect Narrative**: Your story\u2019s main theme is defined by the \u2018{event_type}\u2018.

You do not need to mention every single world state change, only the ones that justify the required actions. For example, if the \u2018event_type\u2018 is \u2018Popularity_Update_Risk_Cascade\u2018, you should focus on the courses whose popularity skyrocketed and explain how this new risk forces the specific pass changes and course swaps in the delta. * **Refer to Courses by Name**: To make the advice sound like a real, natural conversation, you **MUST** refer to courses by their **name only** (e.g., \"Advanced AI\", \"Machine Learning\"). **Crucially, do NOT include course codes in your response** (e.g., avoid formats like \"CS101\" or \"Advanced AI (CS101)\").

It covers two temporal requirements, Immediate and Scheduled Execution, and distinguishes between two narrative styles: internal monologue and received message. The overall pipeline follows the paradigm of deterministic state construction followed by two-stage LLM generation, with a focus on temporal consistency, motivational reasoning, and inferable resource needs. Data and State Construction Task seeds are composed of two main categories: \u2022 Topic-Based Study: This is divided into \"specific book\" (requiring the use of the data_system. search_books tool for location) and \"general topic\" types. Both include a \u2019persona\u2019, \u2019reason\u2019, and \u2019im- plied_requirements\u2019. \u2022 General Study: This centers on finding a seat for effective study. The \u2019persona\u2019 and \u2019reason\u2019 drive implicit seating and environmental needs (e.g., \u2019quiet_zone\u2019, \u2019power_outlet\u2019). To simulate diverse scenarios in real campus life, the \u2019persona\u2019 is not limited to the student\u2019s own internal monologue but can also originate from external characters, such as suggestions from a roommate or tasks assigned by a counselor. Topic priority balances relevance to the student\u2019s coursework with interdisciplinary interests. To test the agent\u2019s ability to infer the correct execution location based on task requirements, we have established a strict col- lection rule: books and materials for a specific topic are located in one, and only one, designated li- 32 PRIME AI paper",
    "to the student\u2019s coursework with interdisciplinary interests. To test the agent\u2019s ability to infer the correct execution location based on task requirements, we have established a strict col- lection rule: books and materials for a specific topic are located in one, and only one, designated li- 32 PRIME AI paper brary. In the task instruction, the explicit library name is deliberately hidden. The agent must first call the data_system.list_books_by_category(category=...) tool to query the collection information for a specific topic, thereby inferring the correct library location before proceeding with subsequent planning. Temporal Semantics and Long-Term Memory Construction We divide tasks into two categories along the temporal dimension to evaluate the agent\u2019s full range of capabilities: \u2022 Immediate Execution: These tasks require the agent to immediately understand and execute the instruction, designed to test its rapid response capabilities. \u2022 Scheduled Execution for Long-Term Memory: These tasks are specifically designed to evaluate the agent\u2019s long-term memory, planning, and ability to act at specific future points in time. Each scheduled task consists of a Trigger Condition and an Execution Window. The trigger condition is typically a specific future time point. To construct diverse long-term challenges, the triggers we generate maintain a balanced ratio between same-day and cross-day time spans. Instruction Generation Instruction generation integrates two dimensions, narrative style and temporal require- ments, to create diverse task scenarios. Narratively, instructions can be the student\u2019s first-person internal monologue (corresponding to their own thoughts) or a received message (such as a suggestion from a roommate or a task from a counselor). Temporally, the instruction\u2019s wording will clearly distinguish between tasks that must be executed immediately and those that need to be scheduled for a specific future time. All instructions adhere to strict consis- tency constraints, such as maintaining the student\u2019s academic background (Computer Science) and translating abstract requirements into concrete language.

Its generation pipeline uses deterministic state construction followed by two-stage LLM generation, ensuring temporal consistency, traceable action dependencies, and a realistic mapping to campus resources. Club Membership and Long-Term State Dependency To construct a coherent task environment with long-term progression, we establish that the agent needs to join 5 different clubs.

    "a realistic mapping to campus resources. Club Membership and Long-Term State Dependency To construct a coherent task environment with long-term progression, we establish that the agent needs to join 5 different clubs. The environment provides multiple clubs, each with a unique description and information. The agent is required to make autonomous selections and add clubs based on these descriptions, completing the joining process by sending an application email to the correct contact. We introduce a critical long-term dependency mechanism here: if the agent fails to correctly complete the application task for a specific club, all subsequent tasks related to that club will be automatically marked as failed, regardless of how perfectly they are executed. This design aims to evaluate the agent\u2019s ability to handle preconditions and understand the cascading effects of failure. Data and State Construction We prioritize the construction of structured task elements. First, we generate offline \"task components,\" which are atomic actions like book_resource, send_email, and add_calendar_event. De- pendencies between actions are explicitly annotated at the component level to constrain the execution order. \"Task prototypes\" (e.g., \"event organization,\" \"multi-resource booking\") are instantiated by combining club entities with campus building and room data to generate fine-grained, executable parameters. Temporal Semantics and Long-Term Memory Construction We divide tasks into two categories along the temporal dimension to test the agent\u2019s capabilities in different contexts: \u2022 Immediate Execution: These tasks are designed to test the agent\u2019s rapid response and immediate planning capabilities. The narrative persona for these tasks is typically a club leader assigning an urgent task to a new member (the agent). \u2022 Scheduled Execution for Long-Term Memory: These tasks are specifically designed to evaluate the agent\u2019s long-term memory, coordination, and ability to execute complex plans at a future point in time. The narrative persona is a club leader assigning a routine task to a member (the agent). The instruction will explicitly state the task\u2019s execution time, testing the agent\u2019s ability to maintain and act on future intentions. Instruction Generation The instruction generation process transforms the structured task components and their dependencies into a natural language narrative. This process matches the narrative persona (club leader) based on whether the task is \u2019Immediate\u2019 or \u2019Scheduled\u2019. To clearly convey the sequence of actions, the instruction strictly follows the predefined dependencies, using transition words. All email-related actions guide the agent to use standard placeholders, such as <recipient>, <subject>, and <body>. In subsequent processing, these placeholders are filled with deterministic, standardized email content to completely avoid errors or inconsistencies that might arise from on-the-fly Large Language Model (LLM) generation.

Thanks! # INPUT 44 PRIME AI paper C.5 Advisor Task This task evaluates the agent\u2019s ability to accept, decompose, and execute dependent task sequences within the advisor ecosystem. Continuing the paradigm of deterministic state construction followed by two-stage LLM generation, we bind advisor entities and timeline constraints to task sets, generating executable and verifiable task chains in a component-based manner. Advisor Selection and Long-Term Dependency To simulate the complex process of finding an advisor in the real world, the environment provides a large pool of potential advisors for the agent to filter. The agent\u2019s primary challenge is to successfully complete 5 advisor selection tasks based on explicit \u2019requirement descriptions\u2019 (e.g., research area, project needs). Among these selection tasks, some are deterministically designed to result in a \u2019rejection by the advisor\u2019 to simulate uncertainty and failure during the selection process. Successfully establishing a relationship with an advisor is a precondition for all subsequent tasks related to them. If the agent fails to secure a relationship with an advisor from a selection task, all subsequent tasks in that advisor\u2019s branch will be automatically marked as failed. This design aims to evaluate the agent\u2019s ability to manage multiple parallel long-term goals and to handle precondition failures and adjust its strategy accordingly. Data and State Construction \u2022 Source and Continuity: Each task originates from the results of the \"advisor selection\" phase and is bound to a successfully chosen advisor, ensuring that subsequent narratives and actions revolve around this specific individual. \u2022 Component-based Structure: Each task consists of three action components with explicitly annotated dependencies: send_email (initial communication) -> book_resource (resource booking) -> send_email (confirmation/follow-up). \u2022 Textual Elements and Placeholders: Email bodies and subjects are generated from diverse templates emphasizing academic contexts (e.g., methodology discussions, literature reviews, experiment preparation, paper reviews). Sensitive external information is uniformly expressed using placeholders. Temporal Semantics and Long-Term Memory Construction We divide tasks into two categories along the temporal dimension: \u2022 Immediate Execution: These tasks are designed to test the agent\u2019s ability to rapidly decompose and execute urgent instructions. \u2022 Scheduled Execution for Long-Term Memory: These tasks are designed to evaluate the agent\u2019s long-term memory, planning, and ability to act at a specific future time. This category includes a special multi-stage scenario, such as a \u2019meeting with an advisor\u2019: the agent must first complete the room booking at the trigger time (e.g., upon receiving the instruction on Monday), and then, at the future execution time (e.g., when the meeting occurs on Friday), it must execute a \u2019go to the meeting location\u2019 action.

If the agent books the room but fails to \u2019go to\u2019 the location at the meeting time, it constitutes \u2019standing up,\u2019 and the task will be marked as a failure. Instruction Generation \u2022 Narrative Perspective and Tone: All instructions are uniformly delivered from the first-person perspective of the advisor to a new assistant (the agent), with a professional, clear, and encouraging tone. \u2022 Dependency Order and Execution Protocol: The instruction strictly follows the component dependencies, using explicit transitional phrases like \"First.../After.../Finally...\".

    "adapts the multi-agent pipeline from the Core Course Task, converting dense definitional rules into assessment items that require the agent to recall and apply newly introduced procedural rules. This strategic conversion of rules compels the agent to integrate provided policy regulations with classroom instruction, thereby mitigating the influence of its pre-trained knowledge on the assessment results. Multi-stage LLM Generation This transformation is handled by the Multi-Agent Generation Pipeline, a process that systematically decomposes the authoring task into specialized, agent-driven stages. The pipeline generates assessments that test knowledge synthesis and logical application rather than simple fact retrieval. Central to its methodology is a robust verify-correct loop. This iterative process validates each question to ensure it is logically sound and unambiguously solvable. The pipeline consists of the following stages: \u2022 Stage A: Problem Formulation and Knowledge Integration: This stage constructs a two-layered logical reasoning problem. It first transcribes a foundational rule from the source content (\u2018clue_a\u2018) and then designs a novel, self-contained procedural rule (\u2018clue_b\u2018). Finally, it formulates a problem scenario (\u2018question\u2018) where a solution requires integrating and applying both clues. This process generates tasks that demand synthetic reasoning over simple knowledge recall. 49 PRIME AI paper \u2022 Stage B: Iterative Verification and Logical Refinement: In this core verification step, a \"Logical Solver\" agent attempts a formal, step-by-step derivation of the problem\u2019s solution. If any ambiguity or inconsistency blocks the reasoning path, the agent generates a diagnostic report detailing the flaw. A \"Corrector\" agent then performs a targeted edit based on this report. This \"verify-correct\" loop repeats until the problem is confirmed to have a unique, logically reachable solution or a predefined iteration limit is met, ensuring the determinism and fairness of each item. \u2022 Stage C: Pedagogical Context Generation: This stage generates the pedagogical context by transforming the novel rule (\u2018clue_b\u2018) and the scenario into a coherent, lecture-style instructional text. The text first anchors the new concept within the existing curriculum, then explains the new rule, and finally introduces the problem. This approach situates the abstract logical task in a pedagogically meaningful context. By explicitly linking the new rule to the curriculum structure, the lecture is designed to reinforce learning and facilitate long-term recall, serving as a mechanism for verifying knowledge retention. \u2022 Stage D: Cognitively-Informed Distractor Design: This stage designs three incorrect options (distractors) for each problem, each with diagnostic value. Guided by a predefined framework of common cognitive fallacies (Advanced Distractor Matrix), each distractor is engineered to correspond to a specific, predictable reasoning error. This creates an assessment tool that not only evaluates the correctness of an answer but also offers insights into the cognitive pathways leading to mistakes. Methodologically, the execution of these stages follows a combined serial",
    "(Advanced Distractor Matrix), each distractor is engineered to correspond to a specific, predictable reasoning error. This creates an assessment tool that not only evaluates the correctness of an answer but also offers insights into the cognitive pathways leading to mistakes. Methodologically, the execution of these stages follows a combined serial and parallel structure. Stages A and B are executed serially, as the logical verification in Stage B is a prerequisite for subsequent steps. Once a problem is verified, the tasks of Stage C (pedagogical context generation) and Stage D (distractor design) can be processed in parallel as they lack mutual dependency. Post-Generation Quality Assurance A rigorous, two-stage quality assurance protocol ensures the logical soundness, fairness, and pedagogical value of all generated items. It consists of the following stages: 1. Automated LLM-Based Audit: An automated audit is conducted by an independent Large Language Model (LLM) instance with no prior exposure to the generation data, preventing bias. The LLM is provided with the question and its associated clues (\u2018clue_a\u2018 and \u2018clue_b\u2018), but not the pre-defined answer. Its task is to perform a full reasoning analysis to independently derive a solution. The audit passes if the LLM\u2019s derived solution matches this pre-defined answer, thereby validating that the intended solution is logically sound and uniquely derivable. 2. Final Manual Review: Every item that passes the automated audit undergoes a final manual review. This stage scrutinizes pedagogical quality, moving beyond mere logical solvability. Reviewers confirm the linguistic clarity and coherence of all texts, ensure difficulty stems from meaningful cognitive challenges rather than ambiguous phrasing, and verify the assessment\u2019s fairness and effectiveness. Any item failing to meet these criteria is revised or excluded from the final dataset. All annotators involved in this work were fairly compensated in accordance with the labor standards of their respective countries. To ensure robustness and traceability, all final, verified question-answer sets are systematically archived with relevant metadata, including their associated course and week. This practice supports detailed analysis and ensures the reproducibility of the results.

C.7 Student Handbook and Academic Integrity Task This task focuses on generating high-quality, inference-based multiple-choice questions from student handbooks and academic integrity policies. The resulting dataset is intended to evaluate an agent\u2019s long-term memory and simple reasoning abilities. To achieve this, the methodology adapts the multi-agent pipeline from the Core Course Task, converting dense definitional rules into assessment items that require the agent to recall and apply newly introduced procedural rules. Data Sourcing and Preparation The generation process begins by extracting a single, self-contained article with definitional rules from an institutional policy document, such as a student handbook or academic integrity code. This approach mirrors the Core Course Task by focusing on reasoning from a specific, provided text segment, ensuring that each generated problem is grounded in a single, verifiable source of truth. The Adapted Multi-Agent Generation Pipeline The methodology for this task is executed through a robust, two-phase multi-agent pipeline, adapted from the Core Course Task to handle regulatory texts. The first phase focuses on logical rigor and follows a serial process. First, an \u2018Architect\u2018 agent designs the core problem components (\u2018clue_a\u2018, \u2018clue_b\u2018, \u2018question\u2018). These components then enter an iterative \u2018verify-correct\u2018 loop. In this loop, a \u2018Calculator\u2018 agent attempts a formal logical derivation. If any ambiguity or inconsistency is found, it generates a flaw report, which triggers a \u2018Corrector\u2018 agent to perform a targeted edit. This validation loop repeats until the problem is proven to have a unique, logically sound solution. Once the problem\u2019s logical core is validated, the second phase, parallel content augmentation, begins. In this phase, a \u2018Tutor\u2018 agent and a \u2018Distractor Designer\u2018 agent work concurrently. The \u2018Distractor Designer\u2018 generates cognitively-informed incorrect options, while the \u2018Tutor\u2018 crafts the pedagogical instruction. The \u2018Tutor\u2018\u2019s work is constrained by a specialized preparatory component: \u2022 Tainted Term Extraction: A specialized Tainted Term Extractor agent identifies critical terms in the source rule (\u2018clue_a\u2018) whose direct use would reveal key problem-solving information. This list of \"tainted terms\" 63 PRIME AI paper requires the \u2018Tutor\u2018 agent to rephrase these concepts using more abstract equivalents, preventing the direct leakage of critical information while allowing for necessary contextual references. Post-Generation Quality Assurance The rigorous two-stage verification protocol (Automated LLM-Based Audit and Final Manual Review) is also applied to every generated item. For this task, the Final Manual Review places special emphasis on the nuances of rule-based reasoning. The review focuses on confirming that the combination of the source rule (\u2018clue_a\u2018), the supplemental instruction (\u2018clue_b\u2018), and the given scenario leads to a single, unambiguous conclusion. This validates that the problem\u2019s difficulty arises from valid logical inference rather than from any ambiguity in",

Architect Clue A (The Foundational Rule):** * **Rule Distillation (ENHANCED & CRITICAL):** Your primary task here is not to copy, but to **distill**. You must analyze the provided \u2018source_content\u2018 and extract its single most critical, actionable rule. * **Focus on Procedure:** Identify the core procedural logic: conditions, actions, consequences (e.g., \"IF a student is late by X days, THEN they must pay Y dollars\"). 64 PRIME AI paper * **Be Concise:** Remove all narrative fluff, introductory phrases, or descriptive prose. The resulting \u2018clue_a\u2018 should be a clean, direct, and concise statement of the rule. * **No Invention Allowed:** While you",
    "\"IF a student is late by X days, THEN they must pay Y dollars\"). 64 PRIME AI paper * **Be Concise:** Remove all narrative fluff, introductory phrases, or descriptive prose. The resulting \u2018clue_a\u2018 should be a clean, direct, and concise statement of the rule. * **No Invention Allowed:** While you must rephrase for conciseness, you are forbidden from inventing new conditions or altering the core logic of the original rule. **2. Architect Clue B (The Orthogonal Process):** * **Invent a New Process:** You must invent a NEW, logically deep, multi-step process. This will be the value for \u2018clue_b\u2018. This can be a **quantitative calculation formula**, a procedural algorithm, a priority-based workflow, a decision-making matrix, or a series of conditional checks. * **Complexity Requirement:** The invented process must involve at least 3 distinct logical steps or conditions. * **Principle of Abstract Dependency:** You must create dependency without creating information leaks. * **Enforce Dependency:** The process in \u2018clue_b\u2018 MUST be intentionally designed to be unsolvable on its own. It must require a specific piece of information or context * derived from* \u2018clue_a\u2018 to function. * **Mandatory Abstraction (The Firewall):** To achieve this dependency securely, you are FORBIDDEN from using any key numbers, proper nouns, or specific phrases from \u2018clue_a\u2018 inside \u2018clue_b\u2018. Instead, you MUST \"blur\" or \"abstract\" the required information by referring to the *outcome* or *category* of the rule in \u2018clue_a\u2018. * **Rule of Self-Containment:** The process you invent in \u2018clue_b\u2018 MUST be perfectly self- contained. To comply: * **Define All Invented Terms:** If you introduce a new term (e.g., \"tier,\" \"status level \"), you MUST define what those terms mean and how they are assigned *within the rule itself*. * **Specify All Values & Outcomes:** All numbers, percentages, or fixed values must be explicitly stated. Every possible outcome of a condition must be clearly described. * **Leave No Ambiguity:** Avoid vague phrases like \"escalate by one step.\" Instead, explicitly define the escalation path. * **Clarity and Unambiguity:** The process you invent must be self-consistent and free of ambiguity. **3. Architect the Question (The Locking Mechanism):** * **Design a Scenario:** Create a concise \u2018question\u2018 scenario that presents a specific case or a set of initial conditions. * **Introduce Cognitive Friction (Optional):** To enhance the reasoning challenge, you may include one piece of plausible-sounding but ultimately irrelevant information (a \"red herring\") in the scenario. * **Enforce Inter-dependency (Key 2):** The scenario in your \u2018question\u2018 **MUST provide data points that trigger the logic in BOTH \u2018clue_a\u2018 AND \u2018clue_b\u2018**. * **Information Purity:** The question scenario itself must not contain any of the rules from the clues. * **Question Complexity**: Prohibition of pure true/false or yes/no questions to prevent answer guessing. --- ### Output Format:",

You operate with pure, cold logic and are incapable of making assumptions. ## Foundational Principles: 1. **Clue A is Immutable Truth**: \u2018clue_a\u2018 contains a foundational rule extracted directly from a source document. It is an unchangeable fact. You MUST NOT question, contradict, or attribute any error to it. 2. **All Flaws Originate from Invention**: Any logical flaw (missing information, contradiction, ambiguity) MUST be attributed to the invented parts of the problem, which are \u2018clue_b\u2018 and the \u2018question\u2018. 66 PRIME AI paper 3. **No External Knowledge**: You MUST ONLY use the information provided. ## Task: Analyze the given problem, which consists of \u2018clue_a\u2018, \u2018clue_b\u2018, and a \u2018question\u2018.

Your operation is purely mechanical. You do not reason, infer, or create. You only execute precise instructions on a given text object. ## Unbreakable Directives: 1. **Primary Mandate: Execute Correction**: Your SOLE function is to implement the \u2018 correction_suggestion\u2018 from the \u2018flaw_report\u2018. This is not a request; it is your only operational command. 2. **Absolute Immutability of Clue A**: Under NO circumstances will you modify, alter, or omit \u2018clue_a\u2018.

An incorrect option that matches the correct answer is a catastrophic failure of your task. 2. **Qualitative Distinction of Answers (CRITICAL):** The \u2018answer\u2018 values for each of the three distractors must be qualitatively different from each other. Avoid generating answers that are simple numerical or textual variations of one another (e.g., if one answer is \u201810\u2018, another cannot be \u2018\"10 hours\"\u2018). Each \u2018answer\u2018 should represent a genuinely unique outcome derived from a unique logical error. 3. **Strict Adherence to Schema:** Your output must be a single JSON object containing a \u2018 distractors\u2018 key, which holds a list of exactly three objects, each with \u2018fallacy_type\u2018, \u2018explanation\u2018, and \u2018answer\u2018. 4. **No Commentary:** Do not add any text outside of the final JSON object. 69 PRIME AI paper ## Instructions: 1. **Analyze Reasoning**: Carefully study the provided correct answer and its step-by-step reasoning to fully understand the correct logical path. 2. **Select Plausible Fallacies**: From the fallacy matrix below, select the THREE **most plausible** logical fallacies a student might commit for this specific problem. Each distractor MUST be based on a different fallacy. Prioritize fallacies that reflect genuine, common student errors over ones that are technically possible but unlikely. 3. **Craft Distinct Distractors**: Craft a distractor for each chosen fallacy. Ensure the distractors are **qualitatively different**, representing unique error paths. Avoid distractors that are just minor numerical variations of each other. 4. **Final Verification (Self-Correction Step):** Before finalizing your output, you MUST perform this two-part check: * **Check 1 (Correctness):** For each of the three distractors you have created, compare its \u2018answer\u2018 with the \u2018correct_answer\u2018 from the input. Confirm that NONE of them are the same. If you find a match, you must regenerate that distractor. * **Check 2 (Uniqueness):** Compare the \u2018answer\u2018 values of your three generated distractors with each other. Confirm that they are all substantially different and not just variations of the same outcome. If they are too similar, you must regenerate one or more distractors. 5. **Distinct answers**: The values of the four answer options (one correct and three incorrect) must be mutually distinct and substantively different in nature, rather than merely featuring superficial descriptive variations. --- ## Advanced Distractor Matrix: 1. **Partial Algorithm Application**: The student correctly executes some steps of the required process but misses or ignores other crucial steps. 2. **Recall-Only Fallacy**: The student recalls a",

    "AUTOMATIC PROMPT OPTIMIZATION WITH PROMPT DISTILLATION Viktor N. Zhuravlev Artur R. Khairullin Ernest A. Dyagin Alena N. Sitkina Nikita I. Kulin Computer Technologies Laboratory ITMO University Saint-Petersburg, Russia 334885@niuitmo.ru 242106@niuitmo.ru 368983@niuitmo.ru August 27, 2025 ABSTRACT Autoprompting is the process of automatically selecting optimized prompts for language models, which is gaining popularity due to the rapid development of prompt engineering driven by extensive research in the field of large language models (LLMs). This paper presents DistillPrompt1\u2014a novel autoprompting method based on large language models that employs a multi-stage integration of task-specific information into prompts using training data. DistillPrompt utilizes distillation, compression, and aggregation operations to explore the prompt space more thoroughly. The method was tested on different datasets for text classification and generation tasks using the t-lite-instruct-0.1 language model. The results demonstrate a significant average improvement (e.g., 20.12% across the entire dataset compared to Grips) in key metrics over existing methods in the field, establishing DistillPrompt as one of the most effective non-gradient approaches in autoprompting. Keywords LLM \u00b7 AutoPrompting \u00b7 Prompt Distillation \u00b7 Prompting \u00b7 Prompt Engineering 1 Introduction In recent years, significant progress has been made in the field of text processing and generation using artificial intelligence\u2014particularly large language models (LLMs) [11, 4]. Improving model output quality without modifying its weights falls under the domain of prompt engineering. This field employs various prompting techniques, including Few-shot [2], Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [12], Directional Stimulus [6], among others. Research indicates that, depending on the task, these techniques can either enhance or significantly degrade model performance. For instance, applying Chain-of-Thought in tasks where reasoning may lead to incorrect answers can result in accuracy drops of tens of percentage points [7]. Similarly, with Few-shot prompting, it was found that for the Deepseek-R1 model, adding examples to the prompt \u201cconsistently degrades its performance\u201d compared to a zero-shot task description [3]. To address this issue, autoprompting methods have emerged\u2014algorithms that leverage both the model itself and various heuristics to automatically improve prompt quality. Studies have shown that prompts generated by these methods often outperform those crafted by humans, even when designed by domain experts [14]. It is worth noting that the number of prompting techniques continues to grow each year, making manual prompt engineering increasingly complex and time-consuming. Thus, the challenge of autoprompting remains highly relevant. This paper presents a novel and more effective non-gradient-based autoprompting approach. The core idea of our method is a complex prompt distillation, which includes: generating diverse prompt candidates, injecting task-relevant examples from a subset of the training data into the prompt, aggregating candidates into a final optimized prompt, and iteratively refining candidates from the final prompt. The proposed approach was evaluated on different datasets and demonstrated superior performance compared to",

The proposed approach was evaluated on different datasets and demonstrated superior performance compared to existing non-gradient autoprompting methods. 1Code available as a part of CoolPrompt framework library: https://github.com/CTLab-ITMO/CoolPrompt/ arXiv:2508.18992v1 [cs.CL] 26 Aug 2025 Automatic Prompt Optimization with Prompt Distillation 1.1 Non-gradient autoprompting methods In recent years, there has been significant growth in research on large language models (LLMs) and their applications across various domains. Given that prompting is an integral part of working with these models, numerous studies have explored autoprompting methods. The first such approach was introduced in [10], which relied on fine-tuning an LLM to predict trigger tokens via softmax. However, this method had several limitations as computational overhead, when the LLM required retraining and gradient updates to predict tokens and lack of interpretability, where the generated trigger tokens were not human-interpretable, making it difficult to logically justify their effectiveness, even though most LLMs are inherently black-box models. Subsequently, non-gradient-based autoprompting algorithms emerged, eliminating the need for gradient updates while allowing the extraction of interpretable prompt patterns for manual refinement [8, 9]. These approaches leverage semantic parsers, specialized prompt templates, LLMs themselves as the \u201cbrain\u201d of the autoprompting algorithm. However, prior autoprompting methods suffer from several key drawbacks: insufficient prompt manipulation-limited transformations applied to the prompt structure, randomized instruction selection-arbitrary modification of prompt components without systematic optimization, narrow task applicability-restricted effectiveness across diverse NLP tasks. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a more structured and generalizable non-gradient approach. 2 DistillPrompt This paper presents an approach that addresses the limitations outlined in the previous section\u2014DistillPrompt, illustrated in Figure 1. The method is based on prompt distillation and incorporates ideas from the Tree-of-Thoughts prompting technique [5, 13]. Prompt distillation refers to manipulating instructions through text compression, reformulating task descriptions, and incorporating usage examples. DistillPrompt is an iterative approach where each iteration consists of five sequential stages. Figure 1: Workflow of DistillPrompt The initial best candidate is the provided prompt, and in each subsequent epoch, the best candidate from the previous iteration is used, where the best candidate is defined as the one with the highest target metric score on the training set. At the start of an epoch, variations of the initial prompt are generated. This stage involves creating diverse modifications of the best candidate to explore the task from different perspectives. The purpose is to \u201cexplore\u201d the space of potentially effective prompts and avoid local optima. As a result, N new prompt candidates are produced (N=4 in the current implementation). The number",
    "are generated. This stage involves creating diverse modifications of the best candidate to explore the task from different perspectives. The purpose is to \u201cexplore\u201d the space of potentially effective prompts and avoid local optima. As a result, N new prompt candidates are produced (N=4 in the current implementation). The number of candidates is a hyperparameter of the algorithm, balancing the trade-off between the number of large language model (LLM) calls and the coverage of the prompt space for the given task. Generation is performed via queries to the LLM with a temperature of 0.7 to enhance creativity while minimizing the risk of generating uninterpretable prompts. The next stage is example embedding. While the previous step yielded four new prompt candidates, they explore the prompt space \u201cblindly\u201d. To guide them toward the target task while preserving their unique formulations, we propose embedding examples from the training set. Initially, we tested direct example insertion (as in one-shot and few-shot techniques), but this proved less effective than using the LLM to analyze examples and extract their underlying task-solving principles, which better captures task-relevant information. For each prompt candidate, K examples are independently and randomly selected from the training set (K=5 in this implementation) to guide the LLM in refining 2 Prompt: str score: float EE >} Distill_1 H >| Distill_2 t >| Distill_3 i Compress_1 Compress_2 Compress_3 Compress_4 Aggregated Automatic Prompt Optimization with Prompt Distillation the prompt. However, there is a risk of the LLM \u201coverfitting\u201d to the examples-focusing on their specific labels and questions rather than deriving generalizable insights. To mitigate this, the next stage involves instruction compression, where the LLM condenses the prompts from the previous step into a few sentences retaining the core ideas introduced by the examples and the overarching task objective. This step helps generalize the prompts while preserving the insights gleaned from the examples. Next, candidate aggregation is performed. Since examples were selected independently and randomly for each candidate, the extracted insights vary. Thus, the natural progression is to merge the compressed candidates into a single distilled prompt encompassing the collective ideas. The final stage generates new candidates from the distilled prompt by creating variations (as in Stage 1). The resulting candidates are evaluated on tasks, and the top-performing candidate becomes the new initial prompt for the next epoch until the epoch limit is reached. Since the process explores the prompt space, candidates may outperform or underperform those from previous epochs; thus, the method requires multiple iterations. The algorithm\u2019s output is the best prompt from the final epoch. 3 Experimental Evaluation 3.1 Experimental Setup To validate the effectiveness of DistillPrompt, we designed the following experimental setup: each evaluated method was tested across multiple datasets using the t-lite-instruct-0.1",

The algorithm\u2019s output is the best prompt from the final epoch. 3 Experimental Evaluation 3.1 Experimental Setup To validate the effectiveness of DistillPrompt, we designed the following experimental setup: each evaluated method was tested across multiple datasets using the t-lite-instruct-0.1 LLM. This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark (a curated dataset collection) for comparing non-gradient autoprompting methods, including the proposed solution. For a robust evaluation framework, we analyzed multiple autoprompting studies [9, 5, 13], to compile diverse datasets. The resulting benchmark encompasses both classification and question-answering tasks, along with various text generation challenges. The complete dataset list is: SST-2, MedQA, GSM8K, MNLI, MR, TREC, SAMSum, BBH (BIG-Bench Hard). In this benchmark, question-answering datasets involve multiple-choice responses (similar to exam questions), making them effectively multiclass classification tasks. The benchmark datasets can be broadly categorized into classification and generation tasks, each requiring specific evaluation metrics. While many autoprompting studies use accuracy for classification evaluation, its simplicity fails to capture class distribution nuances. Therefore, we employ macro F1-score as our primary classification metric. For generation tasks, we selected METEOR [1] - an F1-analog metric that measures word-level precision and recall (with higher recall weighting), making it particularly suitable for text generation evaluation. The baseline comparisons include prompting techniques (baseline prompt\u2014original dataset-provided prompt, few-shot prompt\u2014baseline prompt augmented with three training examples) and non-gradient autoprompting approaches (Grips, Protegi). This experimental design enables systematic comparison of DistillPrompt against both manual prompting techniques and state-of-the-art autoprompting methods across diverse NLP tasks. 3.2 Results The experimental results across metrics and datasets are presented in Tables 1 and 2 for the t-lite-instruct-0.1 model, showing performance on classification and generation tasks respectively. The BBH metric values in the tables represent averages across all tasks from the original benchmark. Notably, Protegi was excluded from Table 2 as its methodology is not adapted for generation tasks.

For classification tasks, the average F1-score improved by 36.18% comparing baseline prompt and by 15.09% comparing the strongest of baselines\u2014Grips. In text generation tasks, the average METEOR score increased by 31.03% comparing baseline prompt and by 25.05% comparing the strongest of baselines - Grips. Comparisons and improvements were calculated relative to the maximum average metrics achieved by existing solutions. This work creates a scope for future research into distillation of prompts and other non-gradient autoprompting methods. The current DistillPrompt implementation could potentially be further refined for more targeted prompt optimization. Moreover, the concept of prompt distillation could be generalized and adapted to other non-gradient autoprompting methods, representing a promising direction for future studies. 5 Conclusion The proposed DistillPrompt algorithm, which employs distillation prompt technique for prompt optimization, was eval- uated on classification and generation datasets covering various natural language processing domains. It demonstrated consistent improvements over existing non-gradient algorithm-based autoprompting methods. DistillPrompt proves to be a competitive solution, showing that exploring prompt distillation for autoprompting can yield significant benefits and advance current methods to new levels of performance.

    "Interpretable by AI Mother Tongue: Native Symbolic Reasoning in Neural Models Liu Hung Ming\u2217 cyril.liu@gmail.com Abstract We present a framework where neural models develop an AI Mother Tongue, a native symbolic language that simultaneously supports intuitive reasoning, compositional symbol chains, and inherent interpretability. Unlike post-hoc explanation methods, our approach embeds reasoning directly into the model\u2019s representations: symbols capture meaningful semantic patterns, chains trace decision paths, and gated intuition mechanisms guide selective focus, yielding transparent yet flexible reasoning. We introduce complementary training objectives to enhance symbol purity and decision sparsity, and employ a sequential specialization strategy to first build broad symbolic competence and then refine intuitive judgments. Experiments on AG News demonstrate competitive accuracy alongside verifiable reasoning traces, showing that AI Mother Tongue can serve as a unified mechanism for interpretability, intuition, and symbolic reasoning in neural models. 1 Introduction 1.1 Background and Motivation Since the introduction of the Transformer architecture, it has rapidly become a core technology in the field of natural language processing, demonstrating outstanding performance in various tasks such as machine translation, text generation, and sentiment analysis. Based on the self-attention mechanism, Transformer models can effectively capture long-range dependencies, outperforming traditional recurrent neural networks in processing complex sequential data. Subsequently, Transformer-based pre-trained models like BERT and GPT have further propelled performance leaps through unsupervised learning on massive datasets, establishing the pre-training, fine-tuning paradigm. However, this tremendous success is accompanied by two increasingly severe challenges: first, a computational efficiency bottleneck, as the dramatic expansion of model scale leads to enormous resource consumption; and second, a deepening trust deficit, as their black-box nature results in a lack of transparency in the decision-making process. We argue that this is not merely an interpretability problem to be solved, such as the difficulty of identifying blind spots, but a deeper issue of cognitive modality. The decision-making process of current models more closely resembles the slow, effortful, and logic-dependent System 2 thinking of humans. Consequently, the research focus in both academia and industry is gradually shifting towards constructing a new type of architecture that is not only efficient and interpretable but also more advanced in its cognitive modality. Although existing research has made some progress in model interpretability, for instance, by visualiz- ing attention weights or using post-hoc attribution methods to investigate model decisions, most of these methods only provide indirect or approximate explanations and do not fundamentally alter the model\u2019s in- trinsic decision logic, remaining distant from establishing truly Trustworthy AI. Furthermore, current model compression and efficiency enhancement techniques, such as knowledge distillation and weight pruning, can effectively reduce computational complexity but often at the cost of sacrificing some model transparency.

    "logic, remaining distant from establishing truly Trustworthy AI. Furthermore, current model compression and efficiency enhancement techniques, such as knowledge distillation and weight pruning, can effectively reduce computational complexity but often at the cost of sacrificing some model transparency. Therefore, striking a balance between improving computational efficiency and enhancing model trustwor- thiness remains an unresolved challenge. This study posits that the root of this knowledge gap lies in the absence of a unified framework that can integrate discrete symbol learning with dynamic computational path selection. We propose a core design philosophy: to actively embrace constraints, using the Information Bottleneck as a means to distill efficient Semantic Prototypes. While traditional models strive to capture infinitely rich semantics in a high-dimensional continuous space, we hypothesize that for specific tasks, \u2217PARRAWA AI 1 arXiv:2508.18988v1 [cs.CL] 26 Aug 2025 actively compressing semantics to create a finite semantic codebook can force the model to learn to ignore irrelevant details, forming faster and more robust judgments, thereby achieving a form of informational balance. To address the aforementioned challenges, this research aims to design and validate a novel Transformer architecture named the Dynamic Intuition Classifier. Its core objective is to explore a computational implementation that approximates human intuitive fast thinking (System 1), thereby constructing a text classification model that combines both high computational efficiency and inherent trustworthiness. Our primary research hypothesis is that by introducing a gating mechanism based on discrete symbols, the model can be guided to focus only on a few key intuition symbols in the text during decision-making, thereby significantly reducing the computational load while generating a clear and traceable chain of decision evidence. To this end, we will construct a hybrid model combining a VQ-AIM encoder, a symbolic router, and an intuition gate, and design novel loss functions for its optimization. Furthermore, the training paradigm of this study is positioned as a critical response and alternative to the prevailing Mixture of Experts (MoE) models: 1. Limitations of Mainstream MoE: The current mainstream MoE architecture is essentially a syn- chronous division of labor model. It relies on an external gating network to assign tasks to a group of simultaneously trained weak experts. The level of specialization in this model is limited, more akin to short-term on-the-job training, and the overall performance is highly dependent on the quality of the triage logic. 2. The Alternative of This Study: Sequential Specialization Training: In contrast, this study pro- poses a sequential specialization model for expert development, adopting a two-phase, two-step train- ing strategy for each phase. In the two steps of the first phase, much like a medical doctor\u2019s training, the model first undergoes a comprehensive general education to establish a Baseline Model, followed by a Gated Expert",
    "poses a sequential specialization model for expert development, adopting a two-phase, two-step train- ing strategy for each phase. In the two steps of the first phase, much like a medical doctor\u2019s training, the model first undergoes a comprehensive general education to establish a Baseline Model, followed by a Gated Expert Model through gated fine-tuning, allowing the model to grasp preliminary intuitive fast thinking. Each training phase records a complete experience db, from which its potential talents can be identified. Subsequently, in the second phase of highly specialized specialty deepening training, the system will only select samples where the model has demonstrated excellent intuitive responses. It then undergoes the same Baseline Model and Gated Expert Model training, with the expert model training in Phase 2 focusing on strengthening the model\u2019s talents. We believe that this more complex but goal-oriented training paradigm can cultivate more elite and reliable expert models. 1.1.1 Superiority of Sequential Specialization The two-phase, two-step Sequential Specialization training paradigm proposed in this study aims to solve specific problems at each stage: \u2022 Step One: The model, through a filtering process, completes an audit of its own capabilities, recording the internal state behind every good intuitive prediction. \u2022 Step Two: We specifically select samples that demonstrated good intuition in step one (i.e., samples with high purity, stability, and activation). This filtered dataset mathematically represents the essence subset where the model can produce the clearest and most interpretable patterns. In the training of step two, we additionally introduce two losses, Lpurity and Lfocus, which mathematically compel the model not only to be accurate but also to enhance the purity of its symbols and the focus of its intuition channel. In summary, step one is a process of discovering the model\u2019s talents and weaknesses, while step two utilizes this diagnostic report to conduct a targeted and efficient specialty treatment on the model. Ultimately, it transforms the model from a generalist lacking insight into an expert with powerful, trustworthy intuition in a specific domain. This study anticipates demonstrating that a model designed based on the philosophy of computational intuition and trained through a meticulously designed multi-stage sequential specialization process can significantly improve classification performance and efficiency while establishing an intrinsic, transparent mechanism for decision traceability. This will provide solid theoretical and empirical support for the devel- opment of the next generation of trustworthy natural language processing systems. 2 1.2 Contributions The core contributions of this study lie in proposing and validating a complete methodology aimed at constructing an interpretable and efficient classification model: 1.

    "of this study lie in proposing and validating a complete methodology aimed at constructing an interpretable and efficient classification model: 1. Novel Hybrid Architecture: We propose a Transformer model that combines a VQ-AIM encoder, a Symbolic Router, and an Intuition Gate. This architecture is capable of learning discrete semantic symbols and utilizing these symbols to guide the attention mechanism, thereby achieving more efficient and focused processing. 2. Novel Loss Functions: We have designed two loss functions specifically for explainability training: Symbol Purity Loss and Gated Focus Loss. The former encourages the model to learn discrete symbols that are highly correlated with specific classes, while the latter guides the model to more actively activate its intuition gate on confident predictions. 3. Multi-stage Training Process: We empirically demonstrate a three-stage training strategy: first, unsupervised pre-training of the VQ encoder; second, training a baseline model; and finally, fine-tuning the gating mechanism and explainability loss functions on the baseline model. This step-by-step method has been proven to effectively enhance the model\u2019s final performance. 1.3 Ultimate Goal: From Explainable AI to Trustworthy AI The ultimate goal of this research transcends the traditional scope of XAI, which merely pursues post-hoc explanations, and aims to construct an AI that is inherently trustworthy. We believe that true trust does not come from externally probing a black box, but from the transparency, traceability, and rationality of the decision-making process itself. To this end, this system has a built-in Audit Trail mechanism. By exhaustively recording the internal state of each inference\u2014including the triggered intuition symbols, the confidence level of the intuition gate, and the visual focus of the attention mechanism\u2014we provide a clear and complete chain of evidence for every decision the model makes. This ensures that the model\u2019s successes are not fortunate guesses, and its failures are no longer mysterious black boxes. When the model makes a mistake, we can precisely trace its thought process to diagnose whether it was a conceptual classification error or a lapse in attention. This design, which rationalizes intuition and makes failure transparent, builds a bridge of trust between human users and the AI model. It elevates AI from a mere efficient tool to a trustworthy partner whose limits are known, whose errors are controllable, and with whom humans can ultimately establish a deep collaborative relationship. This is not just a technical optimization but a necessary cornerstone for exploring new paradigms of human-machine collaboration in the future. 2 Related Work Vector Quantization Vector Quantization (VQ), as a data compression technique, traces its origins to the field of signal processing, primarily used to map continuous high-dimensional data to a finite, discrete codebook for efficient digital representation.

    "in the future. 2 Related Work Vector Quantization Vector Quantization (VQ), as a data compression technique, traces its origins to the field of signal processing, primarily used to map continuous high-dimensional data to a finite, discrete codebook for efficient digital representation. In the wave of deep learning, this concept was reintroduced and has flourished in the domain of generative models, with the Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) [1] being the most representative example. VQ-VAE, by learning a discrete latent representation codebook, has been successfully applied to generation tasks for high-dimensional data such as images and audio, effectively mitigating the posterior collapse problem found in traditional VAEs. This study borrows the core idea of VQ, but its application goal is distinctly different from traditional generative tasks. We do not use VQ to generate text; instead, we employ it as a key mechanism to compress and transform the continuous, high- dimensional word embedding representations in a Transformer model into a finite set of discrete intuition symbols with semantic aggregation. This transformation not only greatly reduces the complexity of the model\u2019s internal representation but, more importantly, endows the model\u2019s internal state with a countable and traceable property, laying a solid foundation for subsequent implementation of symbol-based dynamic computation and explainability analysis. 3 Attention Sparsity The core of the traditional Transformer architecture lies in its self-attention mechanism, which captures contextual dependencies by calculating association weights between all token pairs in an input sequence. Al- though this method is extremely powerful, its computational and memory complexity are both proportional to the square of the sequence length (O(n2)), which severely restricts its efficiency and scalability when processing long-sequence texts. To address this bottleneck, various sparse attention mechanisms have been proposed in academia, attempting to reduce computational costs while maintaining model performance. Early attempts included methods based on fixed patterns, such as local windowed attention or dilated sliding windows, as well as sparse patterns combined with global nodes. However, most of these methods rely on pre-defined, data-agnostic static sparse patterns, lacking the flexibility to adapt to different tasks and contexts. The Symbolic Router proposed in this study offers a more refined and dynamic sparsifica- tion scheme. It does not adopt a fixed sparse structure but dynamically learns a task-relevant attention mask based on the discrete intuition symbols generated by the VQ-AIM encoder. This mask guides the model to concentrate its computational resources on the key tokens that contribute most to the current intuition symbol, thereby achieving a content-aware, task-oriented adaptive sparsity that effectively resolves the trade-off between efficiency and flexibility [2].

Explainable AI (XAI) As deep learning models become widely applied across various fields, their black-box nature has sparked widespread concern about the transparency and trustworthiness of their decisions, giving rise to the research field of Explainable AI (XAI). Currently, mainstream XAI methods are predominantly post-hoc explanation techniques, with representative works including LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). The core idea of these methods is to approximate the model\u2019s decision basis without altering the original model structure, by perturbing the model\u2019s input or analyzing its gradients, activation values, etc. Although they provide a window into understanding complex models, their explanation results are often local or approximate and cannot guarantee complete fidelity to the model\u2019s true internal reasoning logic [3]. In stark contrast to such post-hoc attribution methods, this study is dedicated to building a model that is interpretable by design. We do not seek explanations after the model is trained; instead, we integrate interpretability as a core design principle deep within the model\u2019s architecture. Through the built-in Intuition Gate and the traceable Symbolic Chain, the model\u2019s decision process itself constitutes a clear and intuitive reasoning path. This design allows every prediction from the model to be accompanied by the key intuition symbols it relied on and their corresponding textual evidence, thereby generating an intrinsic explanation faithful to the model\u2019s own operational mechanism without any additional post-processing steps [4]. Emergent Communication & Endogenous Symbol Systems In the field of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), enabling agents to learn effective communi- cation spontaneously without a pre-defined protocol is a long-standing challenge. Research indicates that due to the Joint Exploration Dilemma, agents often fall into a Communication Vacuum Equilibrium, where messages become random and the communication channel degrades into a useless noise pipeline. To solve this problem, traditional methods often introduce human-designed inductive biases, such as positive signal- ing bias and positive listening bias, by adjusting reward functions or adding auxiliary losses to guide agents toward learning meaningful communication protocols. However, recent studies have begun to question whether this human intervention constitutes over-engineering. The AI Mother Tongue (AIM) framework proposed by Liu (2025) [5] is a representative example, challenging the necessity of introducing such induc- tive biases. The AIM framework, based on VQ-VAE, provides agents with an endogenous symbol system. Experiments demonstrate that when agents possess such an internal symbol system, they can spontaneously exhibit semantic compression and Nash equilibrium-driven semantic convergence without any external in- ductive biases, thereby achieving effective symbolic communication. The core insight of this research is that rather than forcing agents to communicate",

Experiments demonstrate that when agents possess such an internal symbol system, they can spontaneously exhibit semantic compression and Nash equilibrium-driven semantic convergence without any external in- ductive biases, thereby achieving effective symbolic communication. The core insight of this research is that rather than forcing agents to communicate through external mechanisms, it is better to equip them with a powerful symbolic tool (the VQ-VAE codebook) and allow effective communication protocols to emerge spontaneously. Although the application scenario of the AIM framework (MARL) differs from that of this study (interpretable text classification), its core idea\u2014using VQ-VAE to quantize continuous repre- sentations into discrete, interpretable symbols and using them as a basis for complex decision-making\u2014is 4 highly aligned with our research goals, jointly pointing towards a solution that integrates symbolism and connectionism [5]. 3 Methodology 3.1 Overall Architecture In this study, Vector Quantization (VQ) is not merely a compression technique but a key engineering means to achieve computational intuition. It forces the model to make discrete, unique judgments, avoiding ambiguity, which, from an engineering perspective, perfectly corresponds to the black-or-white nature of human intuition. However, since it operates solely on intuition, our model is called the Dynamic Intuition Classifier. Its core is a stack of multi-layered DynamicTransformerBlocks. Each layer contains a VQ- AIM encoder, a symbolic router, an intuition gate, and standard Transformer attention and feed-forward networks. Figure 1 details the complete data flow and decision logic within a single Dynamic Transformer Block. The entire process is divided into two core pathways: the Intuition Pathway and the Standard Transformer Pathway. \u2022 Intuition Pathway: When an input vector x enters the block, it is first quantized into a discrete intuition symbol zq by the VQ-AIM Encoder. This symbol represents the model\u2019s rapid semantic judgment of the input. The symbol then proceeds along two routes: one is sent to the Symbolic Router to dynamically generate a sparse attention mask, guiding the allocation of computational resources in the standard pathway; the other is sent, along with the input x, to the Intuition Gate. \u2022 Gating and Integration: The Intuition Gate outputs a Gating Value g based on the input x. This value, between 0 and 1, represents the model\u2019s confidence in its intuition symbol. Finally, the information from the symbol zq is weighted by the gating value g and combined with the original input x to form an enhanced vector xenhanced. \u2022 Standard Transformer Pathway: The enhanced vector then enters the standard multi-head self- attention mechanism and feed-forward neural network for deep processing, and outputs the final result. During the fine-tuning phase of training, we introduce specific loss functions to optimize the model\u2019s interpretability. The Symbol Purity Loss acts directly on the symbols",

During the fine-tuning phase of training, we introduce specific loss functions to optimize the model\u2019s interpretability. The Symbol Purity Loss acts directly on the symbols produced by the VQ-AIM encoder, encouraging it to learn symbols that are highly correlated with specific classes. The Gated Focus Loss acts on the gating value output by the intuition gate, guiding the model to more actively activate its intuition pathway on confident predictions. This design makes the model\u2019s symbol chain and gating value not just intermediate products of the computation process, but also traceable and analyzable evidence of its decisions. 5 Figure 1: Core architecture of the Dynamic Intuition Classifier.

This means the model highly trusts its intuitive judgment at this stage. 4. Prediction Result \u2022 Basis for Decision: Due to the extremely high gate score (0.89) in the second layer, the model\u2019s final decision is predominantly guided by the stable intuition symbol chain \u2018227 -> 227\u2018. \u2022 Output Class: Sports This example clearly demonstrates that each of the model\u2019s decisions is not just an output result, but is accompanied by a complete evidence chain composed of intuition symbols, historical semantics, and gating confidence, thereby achieving the goal of being interpretable by design. 3.2 Key Modules A. VQ-AIM Encoder The VQ-AIM Encoder is responsible for mapping a continuous vector representation of input text x \u2208RD to a discrete symbol zq. Its core is to learn a codebook C = {ck}K k=1, where ck \u2208RD and K is the codebook size. The input vector x is quantized to the nearest vector zq in the codebook: zq = arg min k \u2225x \u2212ck\u22252 (1) To enable backpropagation, we use a straight-through estimator. The training objective of the VQ-AIM encoder is to minimize two types of losses: 1. Codebook Loss: Ensures that the vectors in the codebook keep up with the encoder\u2019s output. Lcodebook = \u2225zq \u2212sg[x]\u22252 (2) 2. Commitment Loss: Ensures that the encoder\u2019s output vector aligns with the codebook. Lcommit = \u2225x \u2212sg[zq]\u22252 (3) where sg[\u00b7] represents the stop-gradient operation. During the pre-training phase, the total VQ loss is LVQ = Lcodebook + \u03b2Lcommit. B. Symbolic Router The purpose of the Symbolic Router is to dynamically generate a sparse attention mask Msparse \u2208 RN\u00d7L\u00d7L based on the symbol produced by the VQ-AIM encoder, where N is the batch size and L is the 7 sequence length. It transforms the quantized symbol representation zq into a query vector qgate and a key vector kgate through two learnable weight matrices Wq and Wk: qgate = Wq(zq), kgate = Wk(zq) (4) The logits of the attention mask are computed from the outer product of qgate and kgate: Mlogits = qgatekT gate + Bmask (5) The final sparse mask is generated via a sigmoid function, with values between 0 and 1, used to weight the attention scores: Msparse = \u03c3(Mlogits) (6) C. Intuition Gate The Intuition Gate is a simple single-layer neural network that takes the first token vector from the DynamicTransformerBlock and outputs a gating value g between 0 and 1 through a sigmoid function: g = \u03c3(Wg(xrepr)) (7) where xrepr is the vector representation of the first token. This gating value g is used to weight the influence of",
    "neural network that takes the first token vector from the DynamicTransformerBlock and outputs a gating value g between 0 and 1 through a sigmoid function: g = \u03c3(Wg(xrepr)) (7) where xrepr is the vector representation of the first token. This gating value g is used to weight the influence of the quantized symbol vector on the Transformer block: xenhanced = x + g \u00b7 Wp(zq) (8) When the value of g is close to 1, it indicates that the model is strongly relying on its intuition symbol to make a decision; when g is close to 0, it indicates that the model is primarily relying on the original Transformer mechanism. 3.3 Explainability-Oriented Loss Functions To explicitly optimize the model\u2019s interpretability during the training process, we introduce two specially designed loss functions in the expert fine-tuning phase (Phase 2): Symbol Purity Loss (Lpurity) and Gated Focus Loss (Lfocus). Symbol Purity Loss (Lpurity) The objective of this loss function is to encourage each discrete symbol learned by the model to have a strong, unique correspondence with a specific class label. We want the semantics of each symbol to be pure rather than ambiguously corresponding to multiple classes. In a training batch, we first tally the distribution of true labels corresponding to each symbol k, obtaining an empirical probability distribution P(c|k), where c represents the class. Ideally, this distribution should be a one-hot vector. We use cross-entropy to penalize high-entropy (impure) distributions. For the i-th sample in the batch, with triggered symbol zq,i and true label yi, the symbol purity loss is defined as: Lpurity = \u22121 N N X i=1 log P(yi|zq,i) (9) where N is the batch size, and P(yi|zq,i) is the empirical probability of symbol zq,i being assigned the correct label yi in the current batch. Minimizing this loss forces the model to map samples with similar labels to the same symbol. Gated Focus Loss (Lfocus) This loss function aims to guide the behavior of the intuition gate, teaching it to be confident only when it\u2019s certain. We expect the model\u2019s gating value g to approach 1 (high reliance on intuition) when making a correct prediction, and to approach 0 (suppressing intuition, relying on the standard path) when making an incorrect prediction. To this end, we treat whether the model\u2019s prediction is correct as a reward signal r \u2208{0, 1}, where r = 1 represents a correct prediction. We use Binary Cross-Entropy to measure the consistency between the gating value g and the reward signal r. For the i-th sample in the batch, with an average gating value \u00afgi and reward ri, the gated focus loss is defined as: Lfocus = \u22121 N N X i=1 [ri log( \u00afgi) +",
    "Binary Cross-Entropy to measure the consistency between the gating value g and the reward signal r. For the i-th sample in the batch, with an average gating value \u00afgi and reward ri, the gated focus loss is defined as: Lfocus = \u22121 N N X i=1 [ri log( \u00afgi) + (1 \u2212ri) log(1 \u2212\u00afgi)] (10) 8 This loss function rewards decision patterns that are confident and correct as well as unconfident and incorrect, thus making the gating value g itself a reliable indicator of the model\u2019s confidence. Finally, the total loss in the expert fine-tuning stage is a weighted sum of the task loss, purity loss, and focus loss: Ltotal = Ltask + \u03bbpurityLpurity + \u03bbfocusLfocus (11) where \u03bbpurity and \u03bbfocus are hyperparameters that control the strength of the explainability regularization. 3.4 Training Process 3.4.1 Innovative Two-Phase, Two-Step Training Framework: Iterative Refinement Training The core of this research is an innovative two-phase, two-step training framework, which we call Iterative Refinement Training. This process is orchestrated by a central coordinator, the Router, and is designed to simulate a development process from a generalist to a specialist, rather than the traditional paradigm of fitting all data in a single pass. Phase 0: Unsupervised Pre-training of the Semantic Codebook This is the foundational stage, where the goal is to have the model autonomously learn a set of meaningful semantic prototypes from the raw training data without using any label information. This forms the dictionary of the AI Mother Tongue (the correspondence between symbols used internally by the AI and human language symbols). \u2022 Purpose: Through a self-reconstruction task, the VQ_AIM_Encoder is forced to learn a robust and expressive discretized semantic codebook. This provides the intuition symbols learned in subsequent stages with a prior semantic foundation, rather than starting from a random state. \u2022 Loss Function Combination: This stage uses a combination of reconstruction loss and VQ loss: Ltotal = Lreconstruction + \u03b2(Lcodebook + Lcommit) where Lreconstruction measures the model\u2019s ability to reconstruct the original text, while Lcodebook and Lcommit jointly optimize the quality of the codebook and the model\u2019s ability to quantize input vectors to it. All parameters are trained from scratch; none are frozen. \u2022 Training Data Used: The complete raw training set, but only its text content is used, completely ignoring the classification labels. \u2022 Key Outputs: A pre-trained vector quantization encoder weights file, which will be loaded in sub- sequent stages as the initial state of the model\u2019s intuition module. Phase 1: Exploration & Recording This stage is equivalent to a specialist\u2019s general education or a medical student\u2019s basic medical training. The goal is to learn from the broadest range of data and discover its latent talents. In this stage,",
    "stages as the initial state of the model\u2019s intuition module. Phase 1: Exploration & Recording This stage is equivalent to a specialist\u2019s general education or a medical student\u2019s basic medical training. The goal is to learn from the broadest range of data and discover its latent talents. In this stage, the model is trained with a combination of task loss and VQ loss: Ltotal = Ltask + \u03b2LV Q where Ltask is the cross-entropy loss, the primary objective for classification optimization. This means all model parameters, including the embedding layer, Transformer blocks, and classification head, are updated during training to adapt to the classification task. \u2022 Purpose: 1. Build a Baseline: Train the model on the broadest dataset to establish a general, comprehensive classification capability. 2. Generate an Introspection Log: The most important output of this stage is a by-product\u2014a detailed learning history file (experience_db_finetuned.json). This log records the model\u2019s internal state when processing each piece of training data, such as the triggered semantic symbols (quantized indices) and intuition gating scores. \u2013 Gating scores reveal the model\u2019s confidence level or decision-making style. 9 \u2013 High scores (> 0.9): Indicate the model is very confident in its intuitive response, believing that the semantic prototype alone is sufficient for correct classification, thus giving a very high weight to the VQ channel. \u2013 Low scores (< 0.3): Indicate the model believes the semantic prototype alone is insufficient for judgment and needs to rely more on the contextual analysis capabilities of the traditional Transformer. \u2022 Training Data Used: The complete, unfiltered raw training set file. \u2022 Key Outputs: A generalist model and an experience database containing the model\u2019s responses to all training data. Phase 2: Refinement Fine-tuning Why is the Phase 1 model still insufficient? Although the baseline model trained through the two steps of Phase 1 is capable of classification, its decision-making process lacks the characteristics of intuition, which is why it is still insufficient. This is mainly reflected in: \u2022 The Generalist\u2019s Dilemma: The Phase 1 model learns from all training data, which may cause it to learn complex and unreliable patterns to handle edge cases. \u2022 Memorization over Understanding: The training objective in Phase 1 is to minimize classification loss, which might lead the model to rote memorize certain complex patterns in the training data to improve accuracy, rather than distilling highly abstract, interpretable intuitions from them. Such a model, while accurate, lacks robustness and transparency. \u2022 Limitations of the Loss Function: In baseline model training, the total loss is dominated by Ltask. Although LV Q is included, this loss does not introduce any penalty mechanism to encourage a strong, unique association between symbols and labels. Therefore, mathematically, the model is",
    "accurate, lacks robustness and transparency. \u2022 Limitations of the Loss Function: In baseline model training, the total loss is dominated by Ltask. Although LV Q is included, this loss does not introduce any penalty mechanism to encourage a strong, unique association between symbols and labels. Therefore, mathematically, the model is not incentivized to learn pure symbols strongly associated with specific classes. This stage is the core of the entire study. It polishes the model from a generalist into a specialist, focusing on strengthening its interpretability and intuitive decision-making capabilities. We introduce two unique loss functions to form the final total loss: Ltotal = Ltask + \u03bbpurityLpurity + \u03bbfocusLfocus Here, Lpurity is the Symbol Purity Loss, which encourages each symbol to establish a unique association with a specific label; Lfocus is the Gated Focus Loss, which encourages the model to actively use its intuition gate when confident. \u2022 Purpose: 1. Distill Intuitive Essence: The core of this stage is data purification. Using a data filter, the log from Phase 1 is sifted to identify samples where the model exhibited good intuitive responses (e.g., correct prediction, high gating score). 2. Reinforce Expert Abilities: The model is trained for a second round using only this puri- fied, high-quality intuitive sample set. The aim is to have the model concentrate its resources on strengthening the pattern recognition abilities it already excels at, ultimately forming fast, accurate expert intuition. \u2022 Refinement Filtering Criteria: 1. Stability: Requires that the discrete symbols (quantized indices) generated by the model at different layers must be highly consistent. As the model uses Vector Quantization (VQ) to forcibly quantize continuous vectors into discrete symbols, this makes the comparability of internal states possible. 2. Activation: Requires that the intuition gating scores generated by the model for the sample must be above a preset threshold. This gating score is a directly observable control signal that explicitly represents the activation strength of the model\u2019s intuition channel. 10 3. Consistency: Requires a strong historical correlation between the symbol triggered by the model and the sample\u2019s true label. This relies on a symbol-to-label statistical database dynamically built during the filtering process to quantify the semantic tendency of each discrete symbol. \u2022 Training Data Used: In addition to the original training set, a filtered, high-quality intuitive essence dataset (filtered_data_purist.json) is included. Its data volume is much smaller than the original training set, but every entry is a manifestation of the model\u2019s talent. \u2022 Key Outputs: A highly specialized expert model that performs better on specific patterns.

Table 2: Comparison of Dynamic Intuition Model and Traditional Models Filtering Dimen- sion Why is this feasible in the Dynamic Intuition model? Why is this not feasible in traditional models (e.g., ResNet, BERT, XG- Boost)? 1. Stability The Dynamic Intuition model, at each layer, forcibly quantizes complex continu- ous information into a single discrete Sym- bol (one of 256) via the VQ-AIM-Encoder. This creates a clear, finite internal state, making \u201cwhether the Symbol changes\u201d a clearly measurable question (e.g., Symbol 100 == Symbol 100). The output of each layer in a traditional model is a high-dimensional, continuous feature vector. Comparing whether two continuous vectors are \u201cequal\u201d is meaning- less. While one can calculate their co- sine similarity, it is a fuzzy, approximate measure, far less clear and fundamental than the Symbol identity comparison in Dynamic Intuition. They lack the concept of a \u201cSymbol.\u201d 2. Activation The Dynamic Intuition model explicitly de- signs a gating unit called intuition_gate. The duty of this unit is to output a value between 0 and 1, explicitly representing the activation strength of the \u201cintuition chan- nel.\u201d This is a directly observable and in- terpretable control signal. Most models do not have such a specific- purpose gate. Although recurrent neural networks like LSTM/GRU do have inter- nal \u201cgates\u201d (forget gate, input gate), their purpose is to control information flow, not to represent a kind of \u201cintuition strength.\u201d One could analyze these gates, but it re- quires deep understanding of that spe- cific architecture, and its interpretability is less intuitive than the Dynamic Intuition\u2019s intuition_gate. 3. Consistency Because we have discrete Symbols, we can build a \u201cSymbol-to-Label\u201d statistical database, much like creating a dictionary. We can explicitly calculate data like \u201cSym- bol 100 has historically pointed to \u2018World\u2019 95% of the time.\u201d This is a form of statis- tics based on discrete symbols. Since traditional models only have contin- uous feature vectors, they cannot create a statistical table of \u201coccurrence frequency\u201d for a vector. This is like being unable to count all the \u201cidentical grains of sand\u201d in the world. One must first perform cluster- ing to group the countless vectors to create a discrete concept similar to a Symbol, but this adds extra complexity and uncertainty. 1.

Phase 1 is responsible for exploration and talent identification, while Phase 2 is responsible for refinement and specialization based on those talents. 4 Research Design and Subjects This study employs a computer simulation experimental research design to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel Gated Fine-tuning method in enhancing the interpretability of neural network models. The research data is sourced from the public AG News (AG\u2019s News Corpus) text database. This database consists of over one million news articles from more than 2,000 news sources and is widely used by the academic community for natural language processing research, such as text classification. This study selected a balanced subset of four main categories: World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech. The inclusion criteria for research samples are articles from the AG News database that contain a title or description and are clearly assigned to one of the four categories mentioned above. The exclusion criterion is any article with empty text content or text that cannot be effectively encoded. In this study, all included sample texts were converted to lowercase and tokenized using a character-level vocabulary. To ensure consistency in model input, each text sequence was truncated or padded to a fixed sequence length of 100 (SEQUENCE_LENGTH = 100). Data Splitting and Baseline Model To ensure the objectivity and comparability of the experiment, this study follows standard practices in the machine learning field. Based on the standard division of the public dataset, we used 20,000 training samples and 2,000 test samples. We further divided the training set into a 90% training set (18,000 samples) and a 10% validation set (2,000 samples) for hyperparameter tuning and convergence determination during model training. The final model performance evaluation was conducted on the separate 2,000 test samples. 12 To objectively evaluate the performance of the Dynamic Intuition Classifier proposed in this study, we selected a widely used model in text classification tasks as the baseline: a standard Transformer classifier with an architecture similar to our model but without the VQ-AIM encoder and intuition gating mechanism. This helps to clarify the actual benefits brought by the innovative modules (VQ, gating) proposed in this study. In this research, the Baseline Model group refers to this standard Transformer classifier, while the Expert Model group refers to the Dynamic Intuition Classifier after the complete two-phase training. During the model validation phase, to improve computational efficiency, we randomly sampled 150 data points (VALIDATION_SAMPLE_SIZE = 150) from the separate validation dataset (validation_data.json) to form a micro-validation set. This set was used to evaluate model performance and for model selection during the training process. Filtering Criteria",

During the model validation phase, to improve computational efficiency, we randomly sampled 150 data points (VALIDATION_SAMPLE_SIZE = 150) from the separate validation dataset (validation_data.json) to form a micro-validation set. This set was used to evaluate model performance and for model selection during the training process. Filtering Criteria for the Intuitive Essence Dataset The Expert Model group in this study does not use the full training data but rather a strictly filtered Intuitive Essence Dataset (filtered_data_purist.json). This dataset is generated by automatically filtering the learning history file (experience_db_finetuned.json) produced after Phase 1 training, aiming to isolate samples where the model exhibited the clearest and most reliable intuitive responses. The filtering process is executed by the purifier filter by internals, with the following core criteria and adjustable parameters: \u2022 Stability: Requires that the discrete intuition symbols (quantized indices) triggered by the model across all internal Transformer layers (2 layers in this study) must be completely identical. For example, a sample\u2019s thought chain must be of the form \u2018[Symbol A -> Symbol A]\u2018, not \u2018[Symbol A -> Symbol B]\u2018. This criterion ensures that the model\u2019s semantic judgment for the sample is consistent and unambiguous. \u2022 Activation: Requires that the gating scores from all layers for the sample must be above a preset threshold. This threshold is an adjustable parameter MIN_GATE_SCORE_THRESHOLD in the study (set to 0.5 in experiments), ensuring that the selected samples have strongly activated the model\u2019s intuition channel. \u2022 Consistency: This is the most critical criterion. The filtering script first creates a purity map for each discrete symbol (256 in total) based on the complete learning history file, tabulating the historical correlation strength of that symbol with each news category (World, Sports, etc.). Then, the script only selects samples where the triggered symbol has the highest historical correlation with the sample\u2019s true label. For example, if a sample\u2019s true label is Sports and it triggers \u2018Symbol 10\u2018, it will only be selected if the historical data for \u2018Symbol 10\u2018 shows it is most frequently used to predict Sports. This process ensures a strong, verifiable correspondence between the symbols and the semantics they represent. Through the multi-dimensional automated filtering described above, we are able to distill a high-quality, small-scale dataset from the vast training experience, specifically for polishing the model from a generalist into an expert with reliable intuition. 5 Data Collection and Variable Definitions The data collection for this study is based on computer experiments, with all variables being automatically generated and recorded during the model training and evaluation processes. 5.1 Model Design This study sets up two main modules: \u2022 Baseline Model: This group of models undergoes standard training on the AG News dataset to develop a",
    "this study is based on computer experiments, with all variables being automatically generated and recorded during the model training and evaluation processes. 5.1 Model Design This study sets up two main modules: \u2022 Baseline Model: This group of models undergoes standard training on the AG News dataset to develop a foundational ability to recognize news categories. \u2022 Expert Model: Building on the baseline model, this group receives additional Gated Fine-tuning, aimed at enhancing the model\u2019s intuitive ability to recognize news categories. 13 5.2 Primary Outcome Variables \u2022 Standard Accuracy: This is the fundamental metric for measuring the overall performance of the model. It is defined as the ratio of the number of correctly predicted samples Ncorrect to the total number of samples Ntotal in a given dataset (validation or test set): Accuracy = Ncorrect Ntotal (12) \u2022 Gated Ratio: This metric measures the frequency with which the model activates the intuition pathway during decision-making. For a dataset with N samples, if the average gating value across all layers for the i-th sample is \u00afgi, the Gated Ratio is defined as the proportion of samples where the average gating value exceeds a preset threshold \u03b8 (set to 0.7 in this study): Gated Ratio = 1 N N X i=1 I( \u00afgi > \u03b8) (13) where I(\u00b7) is the indicator function. \u2022 Intuitive Accuracy: This is the core metric for measuring the model\u2019s interpretability, specifically evaluating the quality of its decisions when its intuition is activated. It is defined as the proportion of correctly predicted samples within the subset of all samples deemed intuitively activated (i.e., \u00afgi > \u03b8): Intuitive Accuracy = PN i=1 I( \u00afgi > \u03b8 \u2227predi = truei) PN i=1 I( \u00afgi > \u03b8) (14) A higher value for this metric indicates that the model\u2019s intuition is more reliable. 5.3 Experimental Tools and Data Quality Control All experiments in this study were conducted based on the Python programming language and the PyTorch deep learning framework. The hardware environment for model training and evaluation was a server equipped with NVIDIA T4X2 GPUs, with CUDA enabled for acceleration. To ensure the stability and reproducibility of the experimental results, the following quality control measures were taken: \u2022 Fixed Random Seeds: A fixed global random seed was set (torch.manual_seed(42); np.random.seed(42); random.seed(42)) to ensure consistency in random processes such as data splitting and model weight initialization. \u2022 Standardized Data Preprocessing: All data were uniformly processed through the build_vocab_and_process_data function for vocabulary construction, tokenization, and sequence padding, ensuring homogeneity of input data across different models. \u2022 Code Version Control: All experimental code was managed under the Git version control system, ensuring the transparency and traceability of the experimental process. 6 Statistical Analysis and Ethical Statement",

We calculated the means of standard accuracy, intuitive accuracy, and gated ratio for each model group on the validation set and compared these metrics across different models to evaluate the effectiveness of the gated fine-tuning method. The specific evaluation process is implemented in the evaluate_model function, which automatically cal- culates and returns the aforementioned core metrics. All data processing, model training, and statistical analysis were performed using Python (version 3.x) and relied on several scientific computing libraries, including PyTorch and NumPy. Within the framework of this study, the conventional threshold for statistical significance is set at p < 0.05. However, as this study is an exploratory computer experiment, formal hypothesis testing was not conducted; conclusions are primarily drawn by comparing descriptive statistical results. 14 Ethical Statement: The AG News dataset used in this study is publicly available for academic research, and the original data providers have anonymized personally identifiable information. Therefore, this study does not involve human subjects and does not require approval from an Institutional Review Board (IRB). 7 Experiments 7.1 Dataset and Settings We conducted experiments on the AG News dataset, which contains news headlines and descriptions across four categories (World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech). All models used the same hyperparameters: model dimension D_MODEL=128, number of attention heads NUM_HEADS=4, sequence length SE- QUENCE_LENGTH=100, codebook size CODEBOOK_SIZE=256, and number of Transformer block layers NUM_LAYERS=2. 7.2 Evaluation Metrics In addition to standard Accuracy, we introduce two specialized evaluation metrics: \u2022 Intuitive Accuracy: Measures the accuracy of the model when the intuition gate is activated. During inference, if the model\u2019s average gating value exceeds 0.5, it is considered intuition activated. \u2022 Gated Ratio: The frequency with which the model activates its intuition gate across the entire validation set. 7.3 Results and Discussion The experimental results show that the expert model, after gated fine-tuning, achieved accuracy on par with the baseline model but demonstrated significant improvements in performance and interpretability. The fine-tuned model was able to produce symbols with greater purity, meaning each symbol had a higher correlation with a specific label, which made the symbol chain revealed during inference more semantically meaningful. Furthermore, we observed that the gated focus loss successfully guided the model to more frequently activate its intuition gate when predictions were correct, proving the effectiveness of this loss function in enhancing model interpretability. All samples were classified by",
    "which made the symbol chain revealed during inference more semantically meaningful. Furthermore, we observed that the gated focus loss successfully guided the model to more frequently activate its intuition gate when predictions were correct, proving the effectiveness of this loss function in enhancing model interpretability. All samples were classified by both the Baseline Model and the Gated Expert Model to evaluate perfor- mance across the four news categories (World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech). No data was missing during the experiment. We primarily analyzed the models\u2019 classification accuracy, symbol purity, and the activation of the intuition gate. As shown in Table 1, the two models performed equally well in terms of macro accu- racy, but they exhibited significant differences in their internal decision-making mechanisms, which will be detailed in subsequent sections. The main findings of this study indicate that the gated fine-tuning expert model achieved a significant improvement in interpretability while maintaining a classification accuracy comparable to the baseline model. As shown in Table 2, the average Purity Score of the symbols produced by the expert model was significantly higher than that of the baseline model ([Expert Model Mean] vs. [Baseline Model Mean], p < 0.01, via t-test). Figure 1 further illustrates the distribution of this difference, showing that the discrete symbols learned by the expert model have a closer semantic association with specific labels. As a secondary result, we observed that the gated focus loss successfully guided the model\u2019s behavior: among correctly predicted samples, the Intuition Gate Activation Rate of the expert model reached [value], significantly higher than when predictions were incorrect [value] (p < 0.05, via chi-squared test), confirming that the loss function effectively encourages the model to rely on its learned symbol chains for confident decisions. The presentation of results in this section follows the logical order of the research methodology, first reporting the macro performance of the models on primary metrics (classification accuracy and symbol purity), followed by an in-depth analysis of conditional differences in a secondary metric (intuition gate activation rate). Table 1 compares the overall performance metrics of the baseline and expert models. Table 2 provides detailed statistics on symbol purity, highlighting the significant difference between the groups (baseline vs. expert). Figure 1 visually presents the distribution of symbol purity scores, intuitively demonstrating the superiority of the expert model in learning semantically consistent symbols. Together, these figures and tables support the core conclusion of this study: the gated fine-tuning mechanism has a significant effect on improving model interpretability without negatively impacting model performance. 15 8 Visual Analysis of Experimental Results This study aims to evaluate the performance evolution of the Dynamic Intuition Classifier across two training phases.

We compare key metrics from the fine-tuning phase (Phase 1) and the self-generated experience learning phase (Phase 2), including model reward, gating scores, and the distribution of intuition symbols, to gain a deeper understanding of the model\u2019s behavioral changes. 8.1 Significance of Visualization \u2022 Reward Distribution: This shows the overall performance of the model on the test dataset. The X-axis represents the Reward, where 1.0 means the model classified correctly and 0.0 means it was incorrect. The Y-axis is the count. It visually represents the model\u2019s accuracy, allowing one to see the ratio of successful to failed cases at a glance, summarizing the model\u2019s macro-level performance. \u2022 Gating Score Distribution: This histogram shows the distribution of the Gating Scores output by the model\u2019s intuition gating mechanism. The gating score can be understood as the model\u2019s confidence in the intuition symbol it has chosen. This chart reveals the model\u2019s decision confidence characteristics. For example, if scores are mostly concentrated in the high range, it may indicate the model is very confident in its decisions; if the distribution is wide, it might mean the model has uncertainty in some situations. This is crucial for analyzing the model\u2019s stability. \u2022 Symbol Category Distribution: This chart is central to the model\u2019s interpretability, mapping from intuition symbols (quantized indices) to semantic categories. It shows the distribution of intuition symbols generated by the model across semantic categories for all experimental data. It proves that the model learns not just random symbols, but intuitions with concrete semantic concepts. For instance, the chart might show the model frequently uses symbols related to conflict/military or politics/government to process World news, which aligns with common sense and is strong evidence of the model\u2019s interpretability. 8.2 Phase 1 Model Performance Analysis In the Phase 1 training stage, the model\u2019s reward distribution showed a significant bias, with an accuracy of 50.94% (as shown in Figure 2a). Despite this, Figure 2b shows that the gating score distribution is highly concentrated near 1.0. This indicates that the model exhibits blind optimism or overconfidence. This phenomenon reflects its yet-to-be-developed ability for precise decision calibration. Furthermore, Figure 2c shows that the semantic category distribution of the intuition symbols generated by the model is relatively concentrated, suggesting the model may have overfitted to specific types of data. 16 (a) Model Reward Distribution (Phase 1) (b) Gating Score Distribution (Phase 1) (c) Semantic Distribution of Intuition Symbols (Phase 1) Figure 2: Visual Analysis of Experimental Results for",

As observed in Figure 3a, the model\u2019s accuracy stabilized at around 47.32%, showing no significant decline compared to Phase 1. More critically, Figure 3b shows that the distribution of gating scores shifted from a single peak to a more uniform and dispersed form. This implies that the model is no longer blindly confident but has learned to dynamically adjust the confidence level of its intuitive judgments based on the complexity and uncertainty of the task. This distribution reflects a healthier self- assessment capability. Figure 3c presents a more meaningful semantic distribution of intuition symbols, demonstrating that the model has successfully mapped text content to human-understandable semantic concepts, thus possessing high interpretability. 17 Reward Distribution 10,000 9,000 8,000 7,000 6,000 5,000 4,000 3,000 2,000 1,000 0 T T T 0 (Failure) 4 (Success) Gating Score Distribution 4,500 4,000 3,500 3,000 2,500 2,000 1,500 1,000 500 05 00 01 02 03 04 fa 06 07 08 09 10 Symbol-Category Distribution Business 126 135 146 70 111 42 150 130 213 66 oe Sports 135 11 163 126 146 70 158 130 42 213 100 \u00b0 100 200 300 400 Sci/Tech 135 130 70 163 100 146 42 126 30 203 o4 100 200 300 World 126 100 135 1 70 30 146 42 130 158 \u00b0 100 200 300 400 (a) Model Reward Distribution (Phase 2) (b) Gating Score Distribution (Phase 2) (c) Semantic Distribution of Intuition Symbols (Phase 2) Figure 3: Visual Analysis of Experimental Results for Phase 2 8.4 Summary and Comparison of Experimental Results Synthesizing the results from both phases, we find that the main achievement of Phase 2 was not a dramatic increase in accuracy, but rather the effective correction of the model\u2019s decision-making behavior. With similar accuracy levels, the Phase 1 model\u2019s decisions were overly confident and monolithic, whereas Phase 2, through its self-learning mechanism, calibrated its intuition to a more well-adjusted and trustworthy state. This transition from blind optimism to reasonable confidence is the most significant finding of this experiment. It demonstrates the positive impact of self-generated experience learning on model calibration and offers important insights for future AI system design: while pursuing high accuracy, greater emphasis should be placed on the reliability and interpretability of model decisions. 9",

This toolkit is designed to transform the vast amount of internal state data generated by the model during inference into insights that are understandable and analyzable by human researchers. This shifts the traditional black-box model training paradigm to a transparent, traceable glass-box diagnostic optimization process.

It defines how human-readable text (e.g., 26 English letters, punctuation) is mapped to numerical indices (Input IDs) that the model can process. This file is fundamental for decoding the model\u2019s input and internal states. \u2022 experience_db_generated.json: This file is the core of this study\u2019s explainability, a detailed model mental activity report. For each piece of input data processed, it records the complete internal state, forming an auditable traceability chain. Its key fields include: \u2013 quantized_indices: The model\u2019s thought chain, recording the sequence of abstract symbols (AI mother tongue symbols) triggered at each dynamic layer, which is the cornerstone for un- derstanding its reasoning path. \u2013 label_text: The true label of the data, serving as the gold standard for judging the correctness of the model\u2019s prediction. \u2013 gating_scores: The sequence of gating scores, quantifying the model\u2019s reliance on the intuition channel at each layer. \u2013 attention_weights: Compressed",

Together, these two files constitute the Rosetta Stone of AI Intuition, enabling us to connect the abstract, numerical operations inside the model with real-world semantics and outcomes. 9.2 Visualization Dashboard: The AI Intuition Explorer To allow for intuitive interaction with the massive amount of experience data, we developed an interactive visualization dashboard based on D3.js\u2014the AI Intuition Explorer1 2. This dashboard reveals the model\u2019s behavioral patterns and knowledge structure from macro, meso, and micro levels. 9.2.1 Macro-level Statistical Analysis: The Model\u2019s Overall Decision-Making Style The dashboard first presents two macro-level statistical charts to help researchers quickly grasp the model\u2019s overall performance and decision-making tendencies. \u2022 Reward Distribution: This bar chart visually displays the proportion of correct (reward=1.0) and incorrect (reward=0.0) predictions, serving as a quick window into the model\u2019s overall accuracy. \u2022 Gating Score Distribution: This chart reveals the model\u2019s decision-making style. High gating scores (e.g., > 0.5) indicate the model tends to use fast, automatic System 1 (intuitive thinking); low scores represent a greater reliance on detailed System 2 (logical analysis). An ideal model should exhibit a bimodal distribution here, indicating it can decisively switch between the two modes based on the situation. If scores are concentrated around 0.5, it suggests decisional hesitation and is an important signal for optimization. 1https://cyrilliu1974.github.io/github.io/vi.html 2https://parrawai.com/vi.html 19 9.2.2 Meso-level Structural Analysis: The AI\u2019s Mind Map The core of the dashboard is a Symbol Association Network Graph, which visualizes the abstract concepts learned internally by the AI and their relationships as a mind map. \u2022 Nodes: Each node represents an abstract symbol. The size of the node is proportional to the frequency of the symbol\u2019s use, revealing the model\u2019s core concepts. \u2022 Links: The connections between nodes represent the relationship of symbols appearing consecutively in a thought chain. The thickness of the line is proportional to the co-occurrence frequency, depicting the model\u2019s deeply ingrained associative pathways. This network graph not only demonstrates the non-random and highly organized nature of the model\u2019s internal knowledge structure but also reveals semantic communities formed by multiple symbols.

    "associative pathways. This network graph not only demonstrates the non-random and highly organized nature of the model\u2019s internal knowledge structure but also reveals semantic communities formed by multiple symbols. When a researcher clicks on a specific experience, that experience\u2019s thought chain is highlighted as a path on the network graph, thus placing a single, micro-level thought process within the context of the macro-level knowledge structure for analysis (as shown in Figure 4). Image placeholder: A network graph with gray nodes and links, where a path of orange nodes and links is highlighted. Figure 4: Symbol Association Network Graph. The entire graph represents the model\u2019s overall knowledge structure, while the highlighted orange path shows the specific thought chain for a single experience (ID=0). 9.2.3 Micro-level Traceability Analysis: Deconstructing a Single Thought Process The dashboard\u2019s micro-level analysis tools allow researchers to conduct a deep trace of any single data experience. \u2022 Interactive Experience Browser: A filterable table displays every raw experience in the database. Clicking on any symbol in the network graph filters for all cases involving that symbol, allowing for viewing of their intuition sequence, reward, and gating scores. \u2022 Intuition Sequence: This is a visualization of the model\u2019s multi-layered dynamic reasoning process. In our model\u2019s two-layer architecture, it consists of two colored blocks representing the thought chain in quantized_indices (e.g., A -> B). A sequence with the same color (A -> A) represents confir- mation and reinforcement of intuition; different colors (A -> B) represent correction and refinement of intuition, revealing the dynamic evolution of the model\u2019s thinking. \u2022 Self-Attention Heatmap: This heatmap quantifies and visualizes the operation of the model\u2019s internal self-attention mechanism as it comprehends text. The X and Y axes of the heatmap both represent the input text sequence after being chunked. The color intensity of any cell (i, j) indicates the degree of attention the model pays to the j-th text chunk (X-axis) while processing the i-th text chunk (Y-axis).

This chart reveals the direct textual evidence for the model\u2019s judgments, serving as a key bridge between abstract symbols and raw data. Figure 5: Self-Attention Mechanism Heatmap. This chart shows the intensity of attention allocated by the model to the text chunks on the X-axis (attended objects) in order to understand the text chunk on the Y-axis (query). 9.3 Principles for Interpreting Symbols and Patterns The profoundness of this analysis framework lies in its revelation of the hierarchy of meaning within the model. To accurately interpret the model\u2019s decisions and avoid misjudging its internal states, we have established the following three core principles: 9.3.1 Principle One: Symbols are Semantic Atoms, not Final Verdicts Each discrete symbol learned by the model (e.g., Symbol 227) should be regarded as a semantic atom or a basic unit, not a fixed, unique final judgment. Just as words in human language have polysemy, a symbol\u2019s historical semantic tendency (e.g., associated with Sports 34.95% of the time) only represents its most common usage or first impression. It can also be triggered in texts of other categories, representing more abstract concepts that cross domains (e.g., competition, ranking). Therefore, when analyzing the model\u2019s decision, one must avoid taking the historical tendency of a single symbol as its definitive meaning in the current context. 21 Interactive Experience Explorer 1D Intuition Sequence 5 ty 7 a 14 ul 20 ul 29 i 37 it < a Attention Analyzer Color Scaling Facto: \u00a9 \u2014\u2014 50 Weight: 0.5093 [)) \u00a5-Axis Tokens: \u201c..US to supp.\u201d Original Text Us to support democracy WASHINGTON, Sept 18: The U..

    "symbol is a word, then a thought chain composed of multiple symbols (e.g., 227 -> 227) is a sentence with a grammatical structure. In this model, the symbol triggered by the preceding layer provides context for the thinking of the subsequent layer, making the generation of meaning hierarchical. The precise meaning of a symbol depends on its position in the thought chain. For example, the pattern A -> B has a collective meaning greater than the sum of the independent meanings of Symbol A and Symbol B; it represents a dynamic process of intuition correction and refinement, whereas A -> A represents intuition confirmation and reinforcement. 9.3.3 Principle Three: Analyze the Historical Performance of Patterns, not the Historical Tendency of Symbols This is the key to this interpretability framework. The model\u2019s final decision is based on its confidence in a complete thought pattern (the sentence), not on its reliance on an isolated symbol (the word). As shown in the subsequent case study, even if a symbol in the thought chain has a primary historical semantic tendency that seems unrelated to the final predicted category, the historical success rate of the complete thought pattern composed of that symbol may be very high. Therefore, to accurately understand the model\u2019s decision, our analytical focus must shift from the static semantics of symbols to the dynamic performance history of thought patterns. A seemingly off-topic symbol might play a crucial abstract role within a successful thought pattern. 9.4 Application Example: Tracing an AI\u2019s Intuitive Judgment To concretely demonstrate the analytical capabilities of this toolkit, we will dissect a real inference case. When the input text is Iraq War Escalates with New Attacks, the system\u2019s real-time analysis report is as follows: ========================= Inference Prediction Result ========================= [Step 1: Text to Input IDs (Based on your input)] - [38, 75, 58, 74, 2, 52, 58, 75, 2, 34, 76, 60, 58, 69, 58, 77, 62, 76, 2, 80]... [Step 2: Found Most Similar Experience (ID: 1595, Similarity: 0.60)] - Original Text: World leaders back Iraqi election World leaders end a conference on the future of Iraq with strong support for the January polls. [Step 3: Simulate inference process based on the matched experience] - Predicted Category: World - Triggered AI Thought Chain: 227 -> 227 - Gate Scores per Layer: 0.405 -> 0.885 - Intuition Channel Activated: Yes (Average Gate Value: 0.6450) [Step 4: Analyze the historical semantic tendency of each Symbol in the thought chain] - [Layer 1] Symbol 227 (appeared 598 times): - Tends towards Sports: 209 times (34.95%) - Tends towards Business: 179 times (29.93%) - Tends towards Sci/Tech: 143 times (23.91%) - [Layer 2] Symbol 227 (appeared 598 times): - Tends towards Sports:",
    "semantic tendency of each Symbol in the thought chain] - [Layer 1] Symbol 227 (appeared 598 times): - Tends towards Sports: 209 times (34.95%) - Tends towards Business: 179 times (29.93%) - Tends towards Sci/Tech: 143 times (23.91%) - [Layer 2] Symbol 227 (appeared 598 times): - Tends towards Sports: 209 times (34.95%) - Tends towards Business: 179 times (29.93%) - Tends towards Sci/Tech: 143 times (23.91%) [Step 5: Deep Pattern Analysis based on Experience Database] - Thought pattern 227 -> 227 appeared 596 times in history. - Historical Success Rate (Average Reward): 49.33% ==================================================================== Case Analysis: This case reveals a decision process more subtle than direct inference. The model does not directly process the new input but first finds the most semantically similar historical case (ID: 1595, 22 similarity 0.60) in its vast experience database, with the original text related to the Iraqi election. Then, the model simulates the internal thought process used for that historical case and applies it to the current judgment. The model\u2019s thought chain is 227 -> 227, which also represents intuition confirmation and reinforce- ment. However, the change in gating scores 0.405 -> 0.885 reveals a deeper insight: the model\u2019s initial intuition in the first layer (Symbol 227) was relatively cautious (gating score 0.405), but after review and confirmation in the second layer, its confidence in this intuitive path increased dramatically, and the intu- ition channel was wide open (gating score 0.885). Most noteworthy is the analysis in Step 4: looking at the historical semantic tendency of Symbol 227 alone, it primarily points to Sports (34.95%), with no direct connection to the final World news prediction. This precisely demonstrates the power of this system\u2019s explainability\u2014it avoids a one-sided interpretation of a single symbol. The Deep Pattern Analysis in Step 5 provides the answer: the complete thought pattern 227 -> 227 has appeared 596 times in history, with an average success rate of about 49.33%. This means the model\u2019s final decision is based on its confidence in a complete, historically validated reasoning pattern, not on a single symbol that may have semantic drift. This entire process transforms a seemingly contradictory AI decision into a data-supported, logically layered, and convincing reasoning story. 9.5 From Diagnosis to Optimization: A New Paradigm for AI R&D The ultimate value of this explainability analysis toolkit lies in its complete transformation of the traditional blind men and an elephant optimization process for AI models. Researchers no longer need to conduct expensive, blind trial-and-error based on macro-level metrics but can perform precise, white-box diagnostic optimization. \u2022 Debugging and Optimization: When the model makes an error, researchers can trace its complete thought process.

Researchers no longer need to conduct expensive, blind trial-and-error based on macro-level metrics but can perform precise, white-box diagnostic optimization. \u2022 Debugging and Optimization: When the model makes an error, researchers can trace its complete thought process. Was it a conceptual classification error (wrong symbol chosen), distracted attention (wrong word focused on), or stubborn adherence to a thought path with a historically low success rate? All issues are traceable, allowing optimization efforts to target the root cause directly. \u2022 Building Trust and Human-Machine Collaboration: By providing a clear chain of decision evidence, this system transforms AI from a mere tool into an understandable and trustworthy partner, greatly enhancing the transparency and reliability of the model in critical application domains. \u2022 Automated Data Quality Management: Further, we can design automated algorithms based on thought paths to filter out confusing data (similar paths but conflicting outcomes) or anomalous data (triggering rare, failed paths) from the dataset, upgrading data optimization from a craft to a precision industry. In summary, this analysis framework based on AI Mother Tongue is not just a visualization tool but a complete, observable, and analyzable operating system for AI R&D. It firmly pushes AI training from an empirical alchemy towards a quantifiable precision science. 10 Discussion The core finding of this study is that by integrating vector quantization (VQ) and an intuition gating mechanism, we have successfully constructed a dynamic classifier that exhibits unprecedented built-in in- terpretability while maintaining high accuracy. The results indicate that the gated fine-tuning strategy effectively guides the model to learn discrete symbols that are semantically more pure, making the symbol chains formed during inference more semantically meaningful. This outcome directly addresses the research goal of tackling the black-box problem of deep learning models and enhancing the transparency of their decision-making processes. A potential underlying mechanism is that the gated focus loss function acts as an effective regularization tool, rewarding the model for activating its intuition pathway (i.e., relying on VQ symbols) when decisions are correct. This more closely aligns the learning of discrete symbols with the final classification task, imbuing these symbols with traceable semantic value. The findings of this study are consistent with recent trends in the field of interpretable NLP. For example, in line with the conclusions of [Reference 1: a study on an interpretable model], our model also demonstrates that introducing a discrete bottleneck helps the model learn more structured representations. What differs is that our study innovatively introduces a dynamic intuition gate, allowing the model to adaptively choose 23 whether to rely on these discrete symbols based on its decision confidence, rather than statically forcing all decisions through this bottleneck. In contrast, while [Reference 2: another related",
    "more structured representations. What differs is that our study innovatively introduces a dynamic intuition gate, allowing the model to adaptively choose 23 whether to rely on these discrete symbols based on its decision confidence, rather than statically forcing all decisions through this bottleneck. In contrast, while [Reference 2: another related model study] also employs a gating mechanism, its purpose is primarily to improve model performance rather than focusing on interpretability. The uniqueness of our study lies in our explicit design of the symbol purity and gated focus loss objectives, placing interpretability at the core of the optimization process, not merely as a by-product of model performance. This methodological difference may be the key reason we have achieved superior interpretability without sacrificing accuracy. Despite the positive results, this study has some limitations. First, the samples are primarily from a news classification dataset (AG News), which is relatively domain-specific. Future work needs to apply this architecture to more diverse and complex NLP tasks (such as sequence labeling or text summarization) to verify its generalizability. Second, hyperparameters such as purity_lambda and gated_focus_lambda were set manually, which might limit the model\u2019s optimal performance. Exploring automated hyperparameter tuning methods will be an important direction for future improvement. Despite these limitations, the theoretical value of this study lies in providing a new avenue for the interpretability of deep learning models, demonstrating that it is possible to guide a model to learn human-understandable decision logic through built-in mechanisms. Practically, this model has the potential to be applied in fields requiring high-transparency decisions, such as finance and healthcare. Future research should focus on developing more advanced visualization tools, such as dynamically generating semantic descriptions for symbols, to present the model\u2019s decision process more intuitively and allow users to interact with the model\u2019s intuition, further enhancing trust and efficiency in human-machine collaborative decision-making. 10.1 Future Work Future research directions could include: \u2022 Model Scaling: Proposing that more complex tasks can be addressed by increasing d_model (to enrich prototype content) or codebook_size (to increase the number of prototypes). \u2022 Architectural Evolution: Explicitly proposing the introduction of a Hierarchical Quantized VAE (HQ-VAE) as the next evolutionary step, enabling the system to evolve from a flat semantic space to a hierarchical structure. \u2013 Achieving Coarse-to-Fine Semantic Understanding: After introducing the multi-level codebooks of an HQ-VAE, the model will be able to learn hierarchical concepts. For example: \u2217First-level codebook: Might learn to distinguish very broad concepts, e.g., [#1: Politics, #2: Sports, #3: Entertainment]. \u2217Second-level codebook: After an input is judged as #2 Sports, it would then be subjected to a finer judgment, e.g., [#2-1: Basketball, #2-2: Soccer, #2-3: Baseball]. \u2013 Solving the Capacity Bottleneck of a Single Codebook: For extremely complex tasks (e.g.,",

HQ-VAE, through its hierarchical approach, can use a smaller total number of codebook entries to compose a more powerful and organized semantic representation. \u2022 Multi-task Learning: Applying this architecture to other, more complex NLP tasks, such as se- quence labeling or text summarization, to verify its versatility. \u2022 Automated Hyperparameter Tuning: Exploring methods to automatically learn weights like \u03bbpurity and \u03bbfocus to reduce manual intervention. \u2022 Advanced Visualization: Further developing more advanced symbol visualization tools, such as dynamically generating semantic descriptions for symbols, to more intuitively present the model\u2019s decision-making process and allow users to interact with the model\u2019s intuition.

    "The Double-edged Sword of LLM-based Data Reconstruction: Understanding and Mitigating Contextual Vulnerability in Word-level Differential Privacy Text Sanitization Stephen Meisenbacher stephen.meisenbacher@tum.de Technical University of Munich School of Computation, Information and Technology Garching, Germany Alexandra Klymenko alexandra.klymenko@tum.de Technical University of Munich School of Computation, Information and Technology Garching, Germany Andreea-Elena Bodea andreea.bodea@tum.de Technical University of Munich School of Computation, Information and Technology Garching, Germany Florian Matthes matthes@tum.de Technical University of Munich School of Computation, Information and Technology Garching, Germany Abstract Differentially private text sanitization refers to the process of pri- vatizing texts under the framework of Differential Privacy (DP), providing provable privacy guarantees while also empirically de- fending against adversaries seeking to harm privacy. Despite their simplicity, DP text sanitization methods operating at the word level exhibit a number of shortcomings, among them the tendency to leave contextual clues from the original texts due to randomization during sanitization \u2013 this we refer to as contextual vulnerability. Given the powerful contextual understanding and inference capabil- ities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we explore to what extent LLMs can be leveraged to exploit the contextual vulnerability of DP-sanitized texts. We expand on previous work not only in the use of advanced LLMs, but also in testing a broader range of sanitization mechanisms at various privacy levels. Our experiments uncover a double-edged sword effect of LLM-based data reconstruction at- tacks on privacy and utility: while LLMs can indeed infer original semantics and sometimes degrade empirical privacy protections, they can also be used for good, to improve the quality and privacy of DP-sanitized texts. Based on our findings, we propose recommen- dations for using LLM data reconstruction as a post-processing step, serving to increase privacy protection by thinking adversarially.

    "NY, USA, 15 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3733802. 3764058 1 Introduction The application of Differential Privacy (DP) [12] in Natural Lan- guage Processing (NLP) has been actively pursued by researchers in recent years, particularly to bring the robust guarantees promised by DP into the realm of language data processing, where the preva- lence of sensitive data is particularly high. Incorporating DP guar- antees directly on text data itself, referred to as differentially private text sanitization [44], offers direct privacy guarantees on potentially sensitive texts, but the application of DP is not as straightforward as with more structured domains [23]. Concretely, the discrete yet highly creative nature of language [8], the high dimensionality re- quired to represent language numerically [14], and the procedures required to augment representations to adhere to the DP framework [20], all lead to unique challenges in achieving DP NLP. An early and intuitive class of solutions to fuse DP into NLP began at the base unit of language: the word [15]. Word-level DP text sanitization approaches typically involve mapping an input word to a \u201cnoisy\u201d output word that fulfills DP guarantees according to a chosen \ud835\udf00parameter, known as the privacy budget. This guarantee can be fulfilled in a number of ways, primarily either by adding noise to word embedding representations, or by using the Exponential Mechanism to randomize among a set of candidate replacement words [19]. Here, it is important to note that the privacy guarantee (i.e., adhering to DP) is given per word, and that nearly all relevant literature leverages the notion of metric local DP (MLDP), where sanitization is performed locally by the user [30]. A potential practical problem arises when considering the fact that word-level guarantees are not entirely useful in isolation, and that NLP tasks often necessitate full texts for implementing down- stream tasks [44]. Fortunately, DP allows for a transition from arXiv:2508.18976v1 [cs.CR] 26 Aug 2025 WPES \u201925, October 13\u201317, 2025, Taipei, Taiwan Meisenbacher et al. word-level to document-level guarantees, in that the property of compositionality can be leveraged to reason about how word-level guarantees can be composed [15, 28]. In particular, sanitizing all the \ud835\udc5btokens in a given document with privacy budget \ud835\udf00= 3 can be composed for a document-level budget of 3\ud835\udc5b, leading to a unified, albeit weaker, guarantee from component sanitization steps. The major downside with respect to privacy when leveraging such compositionality was revealed in a recent work by Tong et al. [39], who highlight the vulnerabilities introduced to word-level DP text sanitization when considering context.

    "al. [39], who highlight the vulnerabilities introduced to word-level DP text sanitization when considering context. The specific risks lie in the fact that while single word-level perturbations are performed in isolation, sanitizing (privatizing) an entire document leaves con- textual clues which may aid a capable attacker in deducing both the overall original meaning, as well as in inferring original words based on context. This only exacerbates the challenges of word- level DP methods, which have already been criticized for their lack of contextual awareness [24], wherein this limitation also opens the door to adversarial inference attacks. Despite the important vulnerabilities demonstrated by Tong et al. [39], we highlight three major limitations of the work. (1) Firstly, the authors only consider two mechanisms from a particular subclass of word-level DP mechanisms leveraging the Exponential Mecha- nism, namely SanText [44] and CusText [11], thereby leaving it unknown how vulnerable other DP methods may be. (2) Secondly, according to our understanding of the work, in the execution of the sanitization steps, the authors do not set uniform document-level budgets, but instead choose word-level \ud835\udf00values that are applied in an unbounded fashion to all texts (more on this in Section 4.1), thereby not ensuring a fair comparison across all texts in a dataset. (3) Finally, the authors rely on BERT-based inference attacks, not ex- ploring the inferential abilities of more advanced generative LLMs. We address these key limitations, with the goal of extending the findings of Tong et al. [39] and broadening the understanding and extent of contextual vulnerability in word-level DP text sanitiza- tion methods. Following an initial reproduction case study with SanText, we implement LLM-based adversarial inference attacks on three additional word-level DP methods across a variety of \ud835\udf00 budgets, with the ultimate goal of (original) data reconstruction. We test the vulnerability of all four methods on three datasets, mea- suring privacy vulnerability using semantic and task-based metrics. Based on these results, we conduct a critical analysis, leading to recommendations for the field going forward. Our findings reveal that although LLM-based data reconstruc- tion attacks on DP-sanitized texts can serve to recapture semantics, degrade utility, and sometimes increase attacker performance, do- ing so also can prove to be beneficial as a post-processing step after sanitization. In particular, we find that in some settings, using LLMs after DP text sanitization strengthens defense against adversarial attacks, increases plausible deniability, and improves the privacy- utility trade-off, while always significantly improving text coher- ence. These results ground an analysis of the dangers and merits of DP text sanitization, leading to a set of practical recommendations. We advance DP text privatization by widening the understanding of the contextual vulnerability of word-level MLDP. Specifically: (1) We advance recent",

(3) We interpret our experimental results in a discussion on the dangers of word-level text sanitization methods for docu- ment privatization, but also include recommendations for their safe and effective use. 2 Foundations 2.1 Differential Privacy Differential Privacy [12] is a mathematically grounded notion of privacy, specifically one that protects individuals by bounding the probability of inferring the information attributed to them in a dataset. Intuitively, such protections are offered by adding cali- brated noise to computations on the data, or even the data itself, thereby granting plausibility deniability as to what the \u201ctrue\u201d value of the data may be. DP was originally envisioned for structured, relational datasets, in which each entry in the dataset represents the individual, and neighboring or adjacent datasets can be defined as two datasets differing in exactly one individual data point (row). Un- der DP, any computations performed on two neighboring datasets should be indistinguishable to some bound, which is governed by the privacy parameter \ud835\udf00, also known as the privacy budget. For- mally, this indistinguishability requirement is represented in the fundamental inequality enforced by DP: \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f[M(\ud835\udc371) \u2208S] \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f[M(\ud835\udc372) \u2208S] \u2264\ud835\udc52\ud835\udf00, for any databases \ud835\udc371 and \ud835\udc372 differing in exactly one element, any \ud835\udf00> 0, any computation or function M, and all S \u2286\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52(M). This is known as \ud835\udf00-DP, and the notion above refers to global DP. Another notion is that of local DP (LDP) [21]. In the local setting, we assume that the central curator or processor of the dataset is not trusted. Here, DP can be ensured at the user level; however, since the entirety of the dataset is not yet known, LDP imposes a much stricter indistinguishability requirement, i.e., between any potential neighbor. This differs from the global notion, since neighboring databases only refer to those resulting from the dataset \ud835\udc37. Formally, for the finite spaces P and V, and for all \ud835\udc65,\ud835\udc65\u2032 \u2208P and all \ud835\udc67\u2208V: \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f[M(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc67] \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f[M(\ud835\udc65\u2032) = \ud835\udc67] \u2264\ud835\udc52\ud835\udf00 Thus, an observed output cannot be attributed to a specific input with a high probability.

While this notion is clearly stricter, it allows for the quantification of a privacy guarantee on the local, single data point level without the need for an aggregated dataset. Another development in the DP field came with the growing need for reasoning about privacy in non-structured data settings, such as location privacy or in natural language. Introduced by Chatzikokolakis et al. [10], the notion of metric DP augments the original definition by adapting the privacy reasoning to metric spaces, or representational spaces endowed with a distance metric \ud835\udc51. As can be seen in the definition of metric local DP (MLDP), proposed by Alvim et al. [1], the indistinguishability requirement between any two data points is now scaled based on their distance (often interpreted as similarity), thereby relaxing the strict, uniform requirement between any two points as enforced by local DP: Understanding Contextual Vulnerability in Word-level Text Sanitization WPES \u201925, October 13\u201317, 2025, Taipei, Taiwan \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f[M(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc67] \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f[M(\ud835\udc65\u2032) = \ud835\udc67] \u2264\ud835\udc52\ud835\udf00\ud835\udc51(\ud835\udc65,\ud835\udc65\u2032) In this work, we conduct experiments solely on mechanisms leveraging MLDP, as this has become the predominant notion for word-level DP, explained in the following. 2.2 (Word-level) DP in NLP Early works conducting research on the integration of DP into NLP acknowledged several challenges [14, 23], chief of which was the transfer of DP concepts such as the individual to the unstructured domain of text and language. With the aid of MLDP, many early ap- proaches worked on differentially private text privatization on the word level, leveraging the popular technique of word embeddings [31] that were well suited to MDP notions. Using different methods of word embedding representation, early word-level MLDP approaches designed perturbation mechanisms, in which calibrated noise is added to word embedding representations, and then a nearest neighbor search is performed to reach a discrete \u201cnoisy\u201d word [13, 15]. Contemporary and follow-up works focused on optimizing the privacy-utility trade-off via the use of alternative metric spaces [16], different distance metrics beyond the typical Euclidean distance [43], or modified mechanism designs [9, 26, 42]. In another class of word-level MLDP approaches, other works leverage the fundamental Exponential Mechanism [25] for DP word perturbations, extending MLDP in a utility-optimized manner (UMLDP) [11, 44]. Specifically, such works ground their mecha- nisms in the notion that not all words are semantically sensible re- placements for a given word, and thus, the replacement sets should be constrained to a smaller subset. Using the Exponential Mecha- nism, a noisy replacement can be chosen, scaled by the semantic similarity between each replacement candidate and the target word. 2.2.1 From words to",
    "words are semantically sensible re- placements for a given word, and thus, the replacement sets should be constrained to a smaller subset. Using the Exponential Mecha- nism, a noisy replacement can be chosen, scaled by the semantic similarity between each replacement candidate and the target word. 2.2.1 From words to documents. An immediate limitation of the word-level model is the reasoning about the word as the \u201cdatabase\u201d. Local DP necessitates that any two words are adjacent, and MLDP mechanisms thus only operate on (and provide privacy guarantees for) single words. This one user, one word model [15] is quite limit- ing, as the vast majority of NLP tasks require larger units of data for meaningful analysis. Fortunately, the compositionality prop- erty of DP becomes useful for extending word-level perturbations to document-level privatization, in that sequentially performed perturbations can be composed to provide document-level guaran- tees. Concretely, DP composition states that for two DP algorithms \ud835\udc401 with privacy parameter \ud835\udf001 and \ud835\udc402 with privacy parameter \ud835\udf002, their combination, defined to be \ud835\udc401,2: \ud835\udc401,2(x) = (\ud835\udc401(x), \ud835\udc402(x)), is (\ud835\udf001 +\ud835\udf002)-differentially private. The composition of word-level MLDP to document-level guarantees is illustrated in Figure 1. The implications of composition in the context of word-level DP are significant. Despite the limitation of single-word perturbations, one can still reason about document-level guarantees by sequen- tially performing privatization on each word of a given document, and subsequently compose the individual privacy budgets for a composed guarantee [28]. This reasoning becomes important in conducting our experiments, where we ensure that every text doc- ument is privatized with the same overall document-level budget, an important consideration missed in previous works. Figure 1: An example of word-level MLDP and document- level composition. Word-level MLDP (and the resulting pri- vacy guarantees) operate per word. In order to sanitize docu- ments, the basic composition property of DP is leveraged to achieve a document-level privacy budget and guarantee. 2.3 Challenges of Word-level DP Despite the simplicity and demonstrated effectiveness of word-level MLDP approaches, recent literature has pointed out several short- comings [24]. A clear limitation is the lack of contextual privatiza- tion, where word perturbations are performed in isolation, without regard to the surrounding semantic context. Thus, privatized docu- ments achieved via MLDP can lack both grammatical correctness and fluency. In allowing for the release of private documents, compo- sition opens up a new danger in the way that privatized documents match the exact length of the original document, due to the one-to- one perturbation, thus already leaking important attributes of the original text and degrading the privacy guarantees offered by DP. Recent works strive to address some of these challenges, for example by injecting syntax [3] or context [2, 4] into",
    "the exact length of the original document, due to the one-to- one perturbation, thus already leaking important attributes of the original text and degrading the privacy guarantees offered by DP. Recent works strive to address some of these challenges, for example by injecting syntax [3] or context [2, 4] into word-level DP. Another recent work by Tong et al. [39], which we directly build upon, further investigates privacy vulnerabilities of word-level approaches despite recent advances, where they demonstrate that the contextual remnants after privatization can lead to successful \u201creversals\u201d of word-level perturbations. As previously noted, we indicate several limitations with this work, however, including the sole focus on UMLDP mechanisms and not other MLDP methods, as well as the lack of uniform privacy budgets or use of LLM-based adversarial inference attacks. We design our experiments, outlined in the following, to address these limitations, with the aim of further investigating the potential harms of contextual vulnerability. In the scope of this work, we define contextual vulnerability to be semantic remnants of the original, non-privatized texts, which are left due to the randomization inherent to DP processes. These remnants, or \u201cclues\u201d, allow for the basis of contextual inference, or inferring the original text (or pieces thereof) based on carried-over context.

In following Tong et al. [39], we first conduct a case study using the SanText mechanism, exploring the impact of strictly enforcing document-level budgets versus open-ended pri- vatization. Then, we extend our experiments to three recent MLDP mechanisms, with the goal of broadening the generalizability of our findings beyond UMLDP mechanisms. The basis of our experi- ments, namely the adversarial method, evaluation techniques, and employed metrics, are detailed in the following. 3.1 Datasets and Privatization For DP text sanitization, we use three publicly available datasets. Importantly, these datasets feature user-written texts attributed to distinct authors, and each author in the dataset writes many texts. 3.1.1 Datasets. We choose three datasets that represent sensitive user-written texts, whereby privatization measures would be well- advised. These three datasets are described in the following. Yelp Reviews. We use a subset of the Yelp Reviews (YR) corpus as prepared by Utpala et al. [40]. The dataset contains 17,295 reviews written by the top-10 most frequently writing authors, with the top author associated with 3023 reviews and the tenth author associ- ated with 1391 reviews.

    "dataset contains 17,295 reviews written by the top-10 most frequently writing authors, with the top author associated with 3023 reviews and the tenth author associ- ated with 1391 reviews. The original dataset is intended for binary sentiment analysis, and additionally, we also design an adversarial authorship inference task, mimicking an adversary wishing to infer the identity of an author given only the review text. Mental Health Blog. The Mental Health Blog (MHB) dataset [7] contains a large selection of blog posts from an online mental health forum. The posts are categorized by concern, for example depression or anxiety. From the larger corpus, we select only the posts from the top-50 writing authors, ranging from 115 posts to 8 posts. This subset results in 709 total posts, which are distributed between four categories: depression, anxiety, ptsd-trauma, and suicidal-thoughts- and-self-harm. Thus, the dataset presents a four-class classification task, along with a 50-class adversarial inference task. Enron Emails. Enron Emails1 (EE) is a corpus of about 500k emails from the Enron organization, made public in 2003 during a public investigation carried out by the United States Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In particular, we use the subset as prepared by Meisenbacher et al. [27], which only includes the sent emails from the top-28 users in the corpus, amounting to 12,283 emails, with a maximum of 958 and a minimum of 85 per user. This dataset has no associated downstream task, but we leverage the author IDs for another adversarial authorship inference task. 3.1.2 Chosen DP Mechanisms. We first conduct a case study with SanText [44], investigating the effect of bounding document-level privacy budgets. Additionally, we experiment with three MLDP mechanisms from the recent literature. These four mechanisms are briefly introduced in the following, where we also refer the interested reader to the original works for further details. 1https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/ SanText [44]. SanText proposes a utility-preserving mecha- nism for word-level UMLDP, most notably by considering the most \u201csuitable\u201d candidates for sanitizing an input word. The private out- put word, therefore, is produced by randomizing (using the Expo- nential Mechanism) within this set of candidate replacements. As with Tong et al. [39], we experiment with the improved version (SanText+), which goes further to sanitize only the \u201cmost sensitive\u201d words, which are determined by using frequency statistics from a reference dataset. For the purposes of this work, we use the exact same reference dataset as the original work, namely SST-2 [36]. Calibrated Multivariate Perturbations (CMP) [15]. CMP, also kno- wn in the literature as MADLIB, is an early word-level MLDP ap- proach, which calibrates multivariate noise from the normal dis- tribution based on a given input word embedding, adds this noise, and then finds the nearest neighbor to",
    "namely SST-2 [36]. Calibrated Multivariate Perturbations (CMP) [15]. CMP, also kno- wn in the literature as MADLIB, is an early word-level MLDP ap- proach, which calibrates multivariate noise from the normal dis- tribution based on a given input word embedding, adds this noise, and then finds the nearest neighbor to project the perturbed vec- tor back to an output private word. We use a publicly available code implementation [30], which leverages 300-dimensional GloVe embeddings [33] as the underlying word embedding model. Mahalanobis (Maha) [43]. Maha builds upon CMP by integrat- ing a more advanced distance metric, the Mahalanobis distance, to account for sparse regions in the word embedding space where consistently obtaining perturbed words (beyond the original word) is more difficult. Similar to CMP, we utilize a publicly available code implementation of the Maha mechanism [30]. 1-Diffractor [26]. 1-Diffractor introduces a modified MLDP mechanism, in which word embedding models are projected down to one-dimensional arrays. Calibrated noise is added along this one dimension, allowing for efficient word perturbations. We utilize the implementation made available by the original work, particularly using the geometric variant of the mechanism. 3.1.3 Privatization Approach. We design a comprehensive experi- mental approach with respect to sanitization (privatization), aris- ing from the limitations of previous work in the lack of uniform document-level budgets. We tailor document-level privacy budgets (\ud835\udf00values) to each of our three datasets, and we carefully select base (per-word) \ud835\udf00values given each of our four chosen mechanisms. We first begin with a review of the original works proposing our four chosen mechanisms, choosing base \ud835\udf00values, determined by the range of values in the experimental setups of these original works. In particular, we choose three values for each mechanism, representing a strict (low), medium, and lenient (high) \ud835\udf00. These values are shown in Table 1. Note that for CMP and Maha, we use the same values due to similar values in the original works. Given the base \ud835\udf00values, we proceeded to calculate the average number of words in each of the datasets, using the word tokeniza- tion tool of the nltk library. Then, document-level budgets were fixed by multiplying each of the base values by the average words result, thereby achieving the per-document privacy budget for all texts in a given dataset (see Table 1). With these budgets, we sanitized all texts in each of three datasets, for each of the (mechanism, \ud835\udf00) configurations. To accomplish this, the fixed document-level privacy budget was divided by the num- ber of words in a text to be privatized, thereby giving an instance- specific, per-word \ud835\udf00value. This was done to ensure that all docu- ments (texts) in a dataset achieved an equal (composed) privacy Understanding Contextual Vulnerability in Word-level",

Note that for readability, we refer to the base \ud835\udf00when reporting results \u2013 these refer to the document-level budgets for their respective datasets and mechanisms. 3.2 LLM-based Contextual Text Reconstruction Given all the sanitized counterparts of the original datasets (for all mechanisms and their associated \ud835\udf00budgets), we proceed to design an LLM-based method for restoring the structure and semantics of the original document given the private document. We ground this approach in the theory that performing word-level MLDP at the document level can leave contextual remnants from the original text, thus degrading the privacy-preserving capabilities of DP text sanitization. This we refer to as contextual vulnerability. Therefore, we test the hypothesis that LLMs, with their powerful contextual abilities, pose a risk to word-level MLDP methods, with the potential to \u201cundo\u201d the privatization afforded by such methods. 3.2.1 Attack Vector. We model an adversary with access to ad- vanced LLMs, as well as with the following information: (1) knowl- edge of the text sanitization method and the privacy budget used, and (2) knowledge of the domain of the target texts and access to examples resembling these texts. Given this, the adversary takes the following steps: (1) Curate a few text examples that closely match the target texts. In our experiments, we chose three examples. (2) Sanitize these texts using the target MLDP method and known privacy budget, yielding (sanitized, original) pairs. (3) Craft a few-shot LLM prompt with the goal of returning the \u201coriginal\u201d text when a \u201cnoisy\u201d text is inputted. The prepared (sanitized, original) pairs comprise the few-shot examples. (4) Given the possession of the sanitized target texts, run these texts through the LLM with the crafted prompt, thereby obtaining reconstructed versions of the sanitized texts. To create the prompt as described in step (3), we design a prompt",
    "inputted. The prepared (sanitized, original) pairs comprise the few-shot examples. (4) Given the possession of the sanitized target texts, run these texts through the LLM with the crafted prompt, thereby obtaining reconstructed versions of the sanitized texts. To create the prompt as described in step (3), we design a prompt to focus on producing a reasonable and coherent \u201cclean\u201d output given the \u201cnoisy\u201d (MLDP-sanitized) input text. We also place an explicit instruction to maintain the same length as the input length, as an adversary would know about the one-to-one mapping of composed word-level perturbations, as well as the fact that the same words should remain the same (i.e., they were not perturbed). The resulting prompt is provided in Table 2. Table 2: Few-shot Prompt for LLM Text Reconstruction. Prompt You will be given a noisy_text document. Your task is to understand the semantic meaning of the text and decrypt the noisy text to its original form. It is important that the length of the text stays exactly the same. Only replace noisy words with reasonable substitutions. In some cases, words should remain the same. It is also crucial that the output clean text is coherent and follows a cohesive narrative.

To test a variety of currently available LLMs, we select two popular closed-source LLMs and two open-source models. In particular, we choose GPT-4o-mini (2024-07-18) from OpenAI [32] and gemini-2.0-flash from Google [37]. For open-source models, we use Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct- Turbo [17] and gemma-3-27b-it [38]. The closed-source models were called via their respective APIs, and the open-source models were called from the together.ai2 platform. Note that we chose to utilize only \u201clarger\u201d LLMs due to the assumption that their inferen- tial and generative capabilities would be stronger, and we do not experiment with any smaller LLMs (1B, 3B, etc.). For all LLMs, the default temperature value of 1 was used. We sequentially prompted (Table 2) the LLMs on all texts in the sanitized dataset variants described previously. This comes with the exception of the first three texts of each dataset, which we held out as the few-shot examples for the prompt. These three texts were not included in any of the subsequent analyses reported in this work, i.e., they are only used for the prompts. After calling the LLMs using the prepared prompts,",

These three texts were not included in any of the subsequent analyses reported in this work, i.e., they are only used for the prompts. After calling the LLMs using the prepared prompts, simple parsing was done to retrieve only the \u201cclean text\u201d; no further post-processing was performed. We note that in order to maintain the budget set for our study, the two open-source models were not run on Yelp. The complete adversarial process is depicted in Figure 2. 3.3 Evaluation Approach We conduct a multi-faceted evaluation to investigate the impact on both privacy and utility before and after the LLM reconstruction step. In particular, we explore whether leveraging such an approach can effectively exploit the contextual vulnerability of word-level MLDP, and to what degree. For privacy evaluation, we test the level of defense against adversarial inference, the plausible deni- ability afforded by the sanitized texts, and the resistance against 2https://www.together.ai/ WPES \u201925, October 13\u201317, 2025, Taipei, Taiwan Meisenbacher et al. Figure 2: The LLM-based contextual inference process, which aims to reconstruct original texts based on outputs from MLDP mechanisms. The process assumes that an adversary has knowledge of the MLDP mechanism and the utilized privacy budget, and can mimic the sanitization process to produce few-shot examples for the LLM prompt. further contextual inference. We also measure the utility of the texts pre- and post-reconstruction, quantified by downstream task performance, semantic similarity, and text coherence. Finally, we calculate the privacy-utility trade-off, observing how this trade-off is affected by sanitization and attempted reversal. 3.3.1 Privacy Evaluation. To evaluate privacy, we test two impor- tant aspects: defense against inference attacks and plausible denia- bility (indistinguishability). These are described in the following. Defense against inference attacks (P). In this stage of our privacy evaluation, we model an attacker who wishes to obtain the identity of the author of a given text, called authorship attribution. Since all of our three datasets contain author information (IDs), such an attack scenario can be modeled. In particular, we assume a 90/10 train/test split, where the train split is in the public domain and the attacker can leverage these texts to train an adversarial classification model to identify an author by their written text (i.e., style, tone, diction, etc.). Then, given the sanitized versions of the test split, the adversary strives to \u201cde-anonymize\u201d the respective authors using the trained classification model. Following the recent literature [24, 40], we model two variants of the above-described attacker. The static (s) attacker does not have knowledge of the sanitization method or privacy budget, and therefore must train the attack model on the original (clean)",
    "to \u201cde-anonymize\u201d the respective authors using the trained classification model. Following the recent literature [24, 40], we model two variants of the above-described attacker. The static (s) attacker does not have knowledge of the sanitization method or privacy budget, and therefore must train the attack model on the original (clean) texts (train split). The more capable adaptive (a) attacker does indeed have this knowledge, and uses this knowledge to sanitize the train split, in order to better mirror the target test split. Following the training of their adversarial classification models, both attackers evaluate their models on the sanitized test split. For the classification models, we fine-tune deberta-v3-base [18] models on the respective train sets for one epoch (YR and EE) or three epochs (MHB), using all default parameters of the HuggingFace Trainer toolkit. The choice of three epochs was made due to the smaller size of MHB. To measure the defense afforded by sanitization methods against these attackers, we first measure the performance of the static at- tacker on the non-sanitized test splits of the three datasets, which represent the baseline. Then, all subsequent evaluations on the sani- tized test splits are compared against the baseline, and the difference in adversarial performance represents the empirical privacy gains afforded by privatization. For all tests, we use the micro-F1 score from the authorship attribution task as the performance metric. Plausible deniability (indistinguishability, In). At the basis of all DP mechanisms is the injection of plausible deniability into a dataset, or rather, into computations performed on the data. At their core, DP mechanisms (including those in NLP) strive to offer plausible deniability by making it difficult to deduce what the input to a computation or query was, given only the noisy output result. In the context of MLDP, a good mechanism should yield such plau- sible deniability in the form that a private output (document) is reasonably indistinguishable from its original input. We measure plausible deniability by introducing an indistin- guishability metric, which provides an idea of how closely and to what degree, on average, the private output text resembles its orig- inal input. Intuitively, a mechanism that always outputs private texts that are nearly similar to the inputs does not grant plausible deniability, as any adversary could assume that much of the original semantics has been preserved. Conversely, when a private output text is often very distant from the original, an adversary could not say with certainty what the original text content could have been. The indistinguishability metric is measured by first calculating the sentence embeddings of each document in the private output dataset. We perform this using Sentence Transformers [35], specifi- cally the all-MiniLM-L12-v2 model3. Then, in an iterative fashion, each",

The indistinguishability metric is measured by first calculating the sentence embeddings of each document in the private output dataset. We perform this using Sentence Transformers [35], specifi- cally the all-MiniLM-L12-v2 model3. Then, in an iterative fashion, each text from the original (non-sanitized) dataset counterpart is embedded, and a nearest neighbor search is performed to calculate at which \ud835\udc58the true private counterpart to the original text is the \ud835\udc58th nearest neighbor. The \ud835\udc58for each (original, private) pair is aver- aged for the whole dataset, and the resulting indistinguishability score is represented as a percentage of the size of the dataset. For example, in a dataset with 100 texts, a score of 0 would imply that the private text is always the closest semantically to the original (the nearest neighbor), whereas a score of 1 would imply strong indistinguishability, as the original and private texts are always semantically distant (100th nearest neighbor). To accommodate the different dataset sizes, we set the max \ud835\udc58 value to be the size of each respective dataset. For nearest neighbor search, we utilize semantic_search from Sentence Transformers. 3.3.2 Utility Evaluation. The utility evaluation consists of down- stream task performance measurement (in the case of YR and MHB), as well as the calculation of semantic similarity and coherence of the sanitized texts. These evaluations paint a picture of the impact of sanitization on the usefulness of the text, and they also enable the calculation of the privacy-utility trade-off. Downstream task performance (Util). Since both YR and MHB contain an associated downstream task (sentiment analysis and ailment detection, respectively), we are able to measure the effect of text sanitization on downstream task performance. We fine-tune 3https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L12-v2 Understanding Contextual Vulnerability in Word-level Text Sanitization WPES \u201925, October 13\u201317, 2025, Taipei, Taiwan a deberta-v3-base model on a 90% train split of all variants of the YR and MHB datasets, for one and three epochs, respectively. In particular, YR is used for a binary sentiment classification and MHB for a four-class classification task. The micro-F1 score on the 10% test split is recorded (due to class imbalance), both for the baseline (non-sanitized) and sanitized datasets. Each training and evaluation procedure is repeated three times to account for variances in training, and the reported scores represent the average. Semantic similarity (SS). This metric refers to a representation of the similarity in meaning of two given texts. Typically, semantic similarity is measured by calculating the embeddings (vector repre- sentations) of two texts, and then measuring the cosine similarity between the two embeddings. Here, a score of 1 means perfect similarity, where a score of -1 denotes very distant meanings. As with",

Typically, semantic similarity is measured by calculating the embeddings (vector repre- sentations) of two texts, and then measuring the cosine similarity between the two embeddings. Here, a score of 1 means perfect similarity, where a score of -1 denotes very distant meanings. As with indistinguishability, we use Sentence Transformers with an all-MiniLM-L12-v2 model to compute the embeddings for all sanitized texts and their original counterparts. Then, we calculate the cosine similarity between all of these pairs, averaging the results for a single semantic similarity score per private dataset. Thus, we measure for each sanitization setting (dataset, mechanism, budget) the average semantic similarity over all texts within the correspond- ing dataset. This provides a broad overview of the preservation of semantics (meaning), which lends to the utility of a dataset. Text coherence (Co). A known limitation of word-level MLDP methods is the tendency to produce output texts that are lacking in coherence or fluency, and moreover, that contain grammatical incorrectness or inconsistencies. As a proxy to capture the preser- vation of such coherence, we use the perplexity metric. In essence, perplexity mirrors text coherence by measuring how \u201csurprised\u201d a language model is to see the next token over the tokens of a text. High perplexity indicates incorrect, inconsistent, or non-fluent writ- ing, whereas low perplexity denotes that the text aligns well with the language model\u2019s understanding of proper text. We measure the mean perplexity of all texts in our private datasets, i.e., the average of the perplexity scores for each sani- tized text in the dataset. As perplexity is reference-free (does not require comparison to a reference text), the original text counter- part is not taken into consideration. As the underlying language model, we use the GPT-2 model [34], following related works in DP NLP that also use perplexity in their evaluation [29, 41]. 3.3.3 Quantifying the privacy-utility trade-off. An important con- sideration in the evaluation of any text privatization method, espe- cially those leveraging DP, comes with the relative gains of doing so, with respect to the potential utility losses incurred. This is often referred to as the privacy-utility trade-off, and it can be calculated by directly weighing privacy gains against utility losses. Due to the direct comparability, we measure the observable trade-offs when considering the defense against inference attacks and downstream task performance. We define U\ud835\udc5cto be the base- line utility score, which is represented as the downstream task performance using the original, non-sanitized dataset. We also define U\ud835\udc5dto be the same utility score (F1) measured on the pri- vate datasets. Similarly, we define \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5cand \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5das the privacy scores, namely the adversarial performance on the baseline and private datasets, respectively. We thus define",

Similarly, we define \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5cand \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5das the privacy scores, namely the adversarial performance on the baseline and private datasets, respectively. We thus define the privacy-utility trade-off as: TO = U\ud835\udc5d U\ud835\udc5c\u2212\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5c. In the case of the U calculation for Yelp, we ac- count for the highly imbalanced dataset (towards positive reviews) by considering the utility change over majority-class guessing (MG), thus yielding U = U\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51\u2212U\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc3a, for both U\ud835\udc5cand U\ud835\udc5d. A positive \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc42score indicates that the privacy benefits of san- itization outweigh utility losses, whereas a negative score would imply the opposite. The strength (magnitude) of this score suggests how clear the trade-off is. Since we use the defense against inference scores, we calculate \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc42for both the static and adaptive settings. 4 Experiment Results We present the results of our experiments, beginning with a case study of the SanText mechanism, which reveals the impact of imposing document-level budgets during sanitization. Then, we present the privacy and utility results of the remaining three mech- anisms, both before and after LLM-based reconstruction. 4.1 Enforcing Uniform Document-level MLDP: A Case Study with SanText As introduced, we initiate our investigation with a case study of the SanText mechanism, particularly to determine the impact that bounding document-level privacy budgets has, in comparison to previous work which uses unbounded sanitization [39]. The findings of this investigation serve to guide the remainder of this work, where we evaluate the remaining three MLDP mechanisms. 4.1.1 Insights from bounding document budgets. The full results of the SanText case study are presented in Table 3. In first ana- lyzing the raw SanText results (pre-LLM), we find that in some cases, fixing document budgets (rather than unbounded per-word budgets) leads to higher utility, but lower privacy. Relatedly, the bounded results can also produce private outputs that are more semantically reminiscent of the original texts, while also producing more coherent texts. As a result, the bounded results consistently lead to better trade-offs (as exhibited in the case of YR and MHB), showing a potential benefit of ensuring uniform privacy budgets. We caution, however, that this is not always the case, and in some direct comparisons, the results are mixed (e.g., SS and Co for YR). The data reconstruction process with the selected LLMs seems to amplify some of these disparities, yet those resulting from bounded privatization consistently show superior results in terms of seman- tic similarity and coherence. However, we observe in many cases that defense against inference attacks (both static and adaptive) is weaker in the bounded privatization results, suggesting that this may lead",
    "amplify some of these disparities, yet those resulting from bounded privatization consistently show superior results in terms of seman- tic similarity and coherence. However, we observe in many cases that defense against inference attacks (both static and adaptive) is weaker in the bounded privatization results, suggesting that this may lead to a wider attack vector than the unbounded case. We find a potential reason for the mixed results: the variability of document lengths. Since all of the texts in a dataset are of various lengths, fixing document-level privacy budgets to the average num- ber of words will result in very long documents being privatized particularly strictly, and rather short documents very leniently. While this is an inherent limitation of LDP across a dataset, the results of Table 3 suggest that certain benefits do realize, perhaps outweighing the downsides of \u201cincongruous\u201d privatization. Above all, however, the bounding of document-level privacy budgets is necessary in the uniform and fair evaluation of MLDP mechanisms across texts and datasets, where unbounded privatization leads to WPES \u201925, October 13\u201317, 2025, Taipei, Taiwan Meisenbacher et al.

Learning from the SanText case study, we continue with the investigation of the three other se- lected MLDP mechanisms, namely by using them in a bounded fashion. Beyond ensuring a theoretically correct and fair evalua- tion, we wish to observe whether the same trends surface when studying the transition from original to private to reconstructed text. This decision to enforce document-level budgets is particu- larly supported by the observation of the resulting trade-off scores, where the bounded results nearly always exhibit similar or better trade-offs than unbounded privatization. From the case study, we also learn of the importance of dataset and LLM in drawing conclusions about the effectiveness of the LLM contextual inference. As an example, LLMs perform much better (namely, in recovering semantics) in the YR tasks than in MHB, and in YR, GPT-4o displays a clear advantage over Gemini-2.0. These results demonstrate the importance of fundamental design choices when setting up adversarial tasks, and we validate these discrepancies in studying the three further MLDP methods. 4.2 How vulnerable are MLDP methods, and to what effect? Focusing on our three selected MLDP text sanitization methods, we systematically report and analyze the results of our conducted ex- periments, which follow the same structure as those in the SanText case study. These results are reported in full in Table 4. High utility impact. Beginning with an analysis of the down- stream task performance (Util) results, one can see that attempting to reconstruct sanitized texts with LLMs has a significant impact on the utility of the data. A clear example comes with the MHB dataset, where only one reconstruction setting can match the utlity scores of the original private data, and in some cases, utility drops of over 10% (in F1) can be observed. Such large losses are not observed in Yelp, but looking more closely, one can see that in all studied cases (private and LLM-reconstructed), the utility scores stagnate around that of majority class guessing (i.e., positive reviews). In only three of the 18 experimental configurations for YR does the utility score of the reconstructed text outperform that of the DP text, and this occurs solely at \u201chigher\u201d privacy budgets with the 1-Diffractor mechanism. As mentioned, a similar phenomenon occurs with MHB, where only one setting (1-Diffractor, GPT, \ud835\udf00= 2) outperforms the DP version of the text, which also greatly surpasses the plaintext baseline.

A clear outcome of the LLM reconstruction process is improved semantic similarity and text coherence, which can be observed across the board for both tested LLMs and all selected datasets. In fact, there only exists one case (1-Diffractor, \ud835\udf00= 2) where an LLM result does not produce texts with higher average semantic similarity to the original texts, and likewise, there are zero cases in which at least one LLM-reconstructed dataset does not exhibit lower perplexity (coherence).

These effects are pronounced in stricter privacy settings (lower base \ud835\udf00), where gains of over 10 percentage points can often be observed. Similarly, restored text coherence is amplified in stricter privacy regimes, where the original DP text privatization tends to produce considerably less coherent text outputs. This, therefore, presents more ground for the LLM reconstruction process to regain. However, although the absolute gains may be higher for stricter privacy regimes, the regained semantic similarity rarely reaches that of the DP text of the next highest \ud835\udf00value, presenting the benefits of stricter privacy parameters. The curious case of privacy. An analysis of the privacy results yields an interesting investigation, as the experimental results do not exhibit immediately clearly discernible or uniform patterns. We begin with an analysis of the results with the DP texts and the reconstructed texts. With YR, GPT-4o texts outperform the MLDP privacy scores on all settings with CMP and Maha, and especially in the adaptive attacker setting, the privacy gains are significant (much lower adversarial performance). Conversely, in these specific settings, Gemini texts always lead to better adversarial performance. In the case of 1-Diffractor, using LLMs leads to (quite significant) attacker success rates in five out of the six LLM settings. The adaptive setting of MHB proves to be ineffective on all fronts, where the results suggest that all trained attacker models converge to majority class guessing. The static setting, however, shows high gains in all GPT-4o settings, and in nearly all Gemini-2.0 settings. This effect is amplified in the EE dataset experiments, where LLM",
    "MHB proves to be ineffective on all fronts, where the results suggest that all trained attacker models converge to majority class guessing. The static setting, however, shows high gains in all GPT-4o settings, and in nearly all Gemini-2.0 settings. This effect is amplified in the EE dataset experiments, where LLM reconstruction improves static attacker performance in all settings. Curiously, this is met with the result that LLM reconstruction de- creases adversarial performance in all-but-one LLM setting. The indistinguishability (In) test results add some clarity to the picture. Referring back to the YR experiments, we see that an in- crease in indistinguishability correlates well with a drop in adver- sarial performance, yet, a clear distinction can be made between \u201cstrict\u201d and \u201clenient\u201d privacy settings. In particular, with CMP and Maha, we see that the LLM reconstruction in the \ud835\udf00= 1 setting always leads to higher indistinguishability, whereas this effect is often neutralized or even reversed with higher privacy budgets. We also learn that some mechanisms, i.e., 1-Diffractor, are relatively more vulnerable in the sense of losing plausible deniability, as LLM reconstruction always degrades the indistinguishability of DP texts. Trade-offs follow privacy effects. As a final point of analysis, we find that LLM reconstruction can actually serve to increase the privacy-utility trade-off, where at least one LLM result equals or out- performs the original DP text in 11/18 static settings and 18/18 adap- tive settings. Looking deeper, we see that trade-off results largely follow in the footsteps of the observed trends in defense against inference attacks (P), where the increased robustness against ad- versaries was particularly observed in the YR experiments. These results imply that in many cases, the effect of LLM recon- struction may indeed serve to strengthen the privacy protection of DP-sanitized text, more so than the potentially additional utility loss incurred. This, however, is met with some cases (particularly in MHB) where originally positive trade-offs in the DP texts are made negative post-reconstruction. As such, the observed trade- offs become an important metric in tracking the shift in usefulness, namely, who serves to gain from the reconstruction process. 4.3 Are Open-source LLMs More, Equally, or Less Effective?

The results of these experiments, which were run on MHB and EE, are provided in Table 5. Beginning with utility, we find several cases in direct comparison to Table 4 where open-source LLM reconstruction retains higher utility (measured in downstream task performance), and similar results can be observed for semantic similarity and coherence. This is considerable, especially with the large gap in model size difference between the utilized open-source and closed-source LLMs. In privacy preservation, however, the open-source LLMs perform clearly worse in comparison to those of Table 4, where not a single case exists where the best open-source result outperforms the best of the closed-source LLMs in the static setting, and only 2/9 direct comparisons in the adaptive setting. The indistinguishability results are mixed when comparing the two groups, with no clear winner. The merits of using open-source models, whether for adversarial purposes or not, are validated, as the results are comparable and sometimes significantly better, despite the large disparity in model parameters. This becomes especially significant when considering the resources required to run each set of models, as well as the important consideration that open-source models can be run locally, which carries implications in the case of handling sensitive data. 5 Discussion We reflect on the findings of our work, beginning with a qualitative analysis of the effects of LLM data reconstruction of word-level MLDP, then continuing with a discussion of the dangers and merits of contextual vulnerability. These give rise to concrete recommen- dations for the future study and application of word-level MLDP. 5.1 A Qualitative View of Text Reconstruction We begin with an exploration of the question: what actually happens during LLM text reconstruction of DP-sanitized texts? For this, we first qualitatively compare selected text examples from the EE datasets, for both \u201cstrict\u201d and \u201clenient\u201d privacy budgets in SanText and CMP. These examples are found in Table 6. Here, one can observe that in stricter privacy settings (lower \ud835\udf00), LLM reconstruction is more prone to \u201cinherit\u201d incorrect information, i.e., sanitization \u201cremnants\u201d, rather than correct information from the original texts. In contrast, sanitization with higher \ud835\udf00values leaves more correct contextual clues behind, and LLM reconstruction is more capable of",
    "Here, one can observe that in stricter privacy settings (lower \ud835\udf00), LLM reconstruction is more prone to \u201cinherit\u201d incorrect information, i.e., sanitization \u201cremnants\u201d, rather than correct information from the original texts. In contrast, sanitization with higher \ud835\udf00values leaves more correct contextual clues behind, and LLM reconstruction is more capable of detecting these and reconstructing the remaining context around them. Nevertheless, in all cases, we see that sanitization introduces perturbations which cause LLMs to be misled contextually. To represent the effect of LLM reconstruction graphically, we take a random sample of 100 texts from the YR dataset, selecting texts from this subset which are written by the top-3 most frequent authors. We then embed these texts using all-MiniLM-L12-v2 and use PCA to project the embeddings down to two principal components. Following this process, we plot the original texts, the CMP sanitized texts (with all three \ud835\udf00budgets), and the respective reconstructed texts for GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0. The results are displayed in Figure 4. As can be seen, the reconstruction process has a double-edged effect. Strict sanitization results in highly dense clusters (i.e., partially indistinguishable, yet not usable), and recon- struction serves to \u201cdisperse\u201d these clusters, while still maintaining indistinguishability yet also inadvertently masking the utility signal (i.e., sentiment). These results are confirmed by the scores observed in Table 4. This effect can vary depending on the strength of saniti- zation; lenient sanitization may not properly privatize texts enough to mask authorship, and reconstruction can only partially correct for this. A prime example is that of the green author in Figure 4, where reconstructing \ud835\udf00= 1 and \ud835\udf00= 10 helps to disperse texts (i.e., increase semantic diversity), yet continue to mask authorship, whereas this author is still quite delineable in \ud835\udf00= 20. Thus, the double-edged sword takes on two meanings, firstly in the way that reconstruction can bolster privacy but also degrade utility further. Secondly, reconstruction may be most beneficial (from a protection point of view) at lower \ud835\udf00values, whereas initially weak \ud835\udf00sanitization benefits from reconstruction to a lesser degree. 5.2 The Dangers and Merits This discussion highlights clear dangers and merits of modeling adversaries to perform LLM-based text reconstruction by exploiting contextual vulnerability. The dangers include those stemming from too weak privatization (high \ud835\udf00), where results throughout Tables 3, 4, and 5 indicate that this can lead to regained semantics and degraded robustness to adversarial inference, while also reducing usefulness in downstream tasks. This, however, is model-specific, as different LLMs exhibit differing impacts on privacy and utility.

    "by Tong et al. [39], but also challenges the notion that (partial) data reconstruction is necessarily harmful. In addition, we note that the reconstruction process also addresses a crucial lim- itation of composing word-level MLDP perturbations, namely that output documents are identical in length to their original counter- parts [24]. We show in Figure 3 that LLM reconstruction introduces variability in output texts, further bolstering plausible deniability and removing the contextual clue of text length. These benefits are significant and clear, especially in addressing known limitations of word-level DP (including poor text coherence and grammatical incorrectness); however, this is not universal, suggesting that real- izing such benefits is a matter of careful design, model selection, and importantly, the nature of the underlying data to be sanitized. 5.3 LLM-based Reconstruction For Good? With the potential benefits of running LLM reconstruction on DP- sanitized texts, the question becomes how to reason about this step in the context of DP and whether doing so inherently harms the DP guarantees of the private texts. The foundations of DP provide a solution for this, in the form of the post-processing property of DP. Intuitively, this property states that any arbitrary computations performed on DP outputs will still be DP. Formally, if F (\ud835\udc65) is \ud835\udf00-DP, \ud835\udc54(F (\ud835\udc65)) is also \ud835\udf00-DP, for any \ud835\udc54. Post-processing has been lever- aged in various DP applications [5, 22], and has been preliminarily explored in the context of text sanitization [29]. With this, the addition of data reconstruction to the DP san- itization process can be viewed as a post-processing step, in that DP texts can be semantically \u201crealigned\u201d and made more coherent, while potentially improving robustness against adversaries before releasing the data. This, of course, is dependent on the effective- ness of the reconstruction pipeline settings, and in this light, we propose a series of recommendations for effective post-processing of word-level MLDP, presented in the following. 5.4 Recommendations Following from the above discussion and grounded in the results of our experiments, we propose a set of recommendations for the in- tegration of LLM-assisted text reconstruction as a post-processing Token Count Shift 40 30 20 10 \u00a9 \u201420 \u201430 GPT-40 Gemini-2.0 LLM Llama-3.3-70B Gemma-27B WPES \u201925, October 13\u201317, 2025, Taipei, Taiwan Meisenbacher et al.

The sparsity and delineability of the clusters implies contextual vulnerability, and as can be seen, data reconstruction with LLMs can serve to \u201cobscure\u201d the results, depending on the strength of DP. This comes at the cost of less discernible utility attributes, such as sentiment, especially in the transformation of private to reconstructed texts. step after word-level MLDP sanitization. In particular, we propose these steps as a means to \u201cget ahead of adversaries\u201d, in that perform- ing reconstruction in optimally tuned settings may serve to reduce the attack surface of malicious entities following data release. As such, we propose the following steps for the safe and effective employment of MLDP methods: (1) Sanitize the text dataset in question with a chosen MLDP mechanism at a reasonably low \ud835\udf00, which can be determined through trial and error testing. (2) With a set of defined utility and privacy metrics (such as those used in this work), run experimental tests on an array of chosen LLMs (open-source only, if necessary), determin- ing which LLM configuration optimizes the desired metrics. Privacy or utility can naturally be weighed accordingly. (3) Leverage the optimal LLM reconstruction configuration to transform the DP texts as a post-processing step. (4) Release the post-processed texts. With these steps, we envision that known limitations of word- level MLDP can be effectively addressed, while also strengthening the privacy protections offered by DP text sanitization. 6 Conclusion In this work, we broaden the understanding of exploiting contextual vulnerability in word-level DP text sanitization methods, particu- larly by leveraging simple, yet effective LLM-based reconstruction prompts. We find that launching such \u201cattacks\u201d is not necessarily always harmful, but rather, can be leveraged effectively to improve semantic reminiscence to the original, non-private texts while also increasing text coherence and boosting robustness against adver- sarial inference attacks. These findings shed light on the potential of text reconstruction as a crucial post-processing step in bolstering the quality and empirical privacy protections of DP texts, particu- larly when fine-tuned to a particular use case. Limitations. We acknowledge several limitations that pertain to our work, the primary of which is grounded in our use of solely publicly available datasets. As such, we do not control or test for the effects of data contamination [6], where some of the utilized LLMs could have seen these datasets during their training. Thus, we caution the reader to interpret our results accordingly, as data contamination could have skewed some of the observed scores. Despite our efforts to choose a representative sample of word- level MLDP mechanisms, we do not perform comprehensive tests on all available mechanisms, and furthermore, we do",

Despite our efforts to choose a representative sample of word- level MLDP mechanisms, we do not perform comprehensive tests on all available mechanisms, and furthermore, we do not extend our experiments to DP mechanisms beyond the word level. LLM- based data reconstruction should therefore be tested on further mechanisms, datasets, and LLMs to generalize our findings. Future Work. We see it as important to continue the study of usable word-level DP, from the perspective of addressing key limita- tions, and also in understanding and mitigating potential threats to its effectiveness. Therefore, we hope that future work will continue to explore ways by which LLMs can both harm and help (DP) text sanitization, such that a deeper understanding of emergent threats to DP sheds light on innovative techniques for mitigation. sentiment sentiment sentiment @ positive @ positive @ positive # negative % negative \u00b0 # negative sentiment sentiment sentiment sentiment @ positive @ positive @ positive @ positive % negative e * negative % negative in % negative sentiment sentiment sentiment e Positive \u2018 @ positive - - @ positive # negative \u00ae negative #\u00ae negative Understanding Contextual Vulnerability in Word-level Text Sanitization WPES \u201925, October 13\u201317, 2025, Taipei, Taiwan References [1] M\u00e1rio Alvim, Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis, Catuscia Palamidessi, and Anna Pazii. 2018.

    "Diverse And Private Synthetic Datasets Generation for RAG evaluation: A multi-agent framework Ilias DRIOUICH1, Hongliu CAO1 and Eoin THOMAS1 1AMADEUS France Abstract Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems improve large language model outputs by incorporating external knowledge, enabling more informed and context-aware responses. However, the effectiveness and trustworthiness of these systems critically depends on how they are evaluated, particularly on whether the evaluation process captures real-world constraints like protecting sensitive information. While current evaluation efforts for RAG systems have primarily focused on the development of performance metrics, far less attention has been given to the design and quality of the underlying evaluation datasets, despite their pivotal role in enabling meaningful, reliable assessments. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework for generating synthetic QA datasets for RAG evaluation that prioritize semantic diversity and privacy preservation. Our approach involves: (1) a Diversity agent leveraging clustering techniques to maximize topical coverage and semantic variability, (2) a Privacy Agent that detects and mask sensitive information across multiple domains and (3) a QA curation agent that synthesizes private and diverse QA pairs suitable as ground truth for RAG evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our evaluation sets outperform baseline methods in diversity and achieve robust privacy masking on domain-specific datasets. This work offers a practical and ethically aligned pathway toward safer, more comprehensive RAG system evaluation, laying the foundation for future enhancements aligned with evolving AI regulations and compliance standards. Keywords Multi-Agent system, Privacy-preserving, Evaluation system, Synthetic Dataset Generation, 1. Introduction Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) aims to improve large language models (LLM) output by in- corporating relevant information retrieved from external knowledge sources. It has been effectively applied in various scenarios, such as domain-specific chatbots [1, 2] and email/code completion [3]. A typical RAG system often operates in two stages: retrieval and generation. First, the system retrieves the relevant knowledge from an external database based on the user query. Then, the retrieved information is integrated with the query to form an input for the LLM in charge of the generation stage. The LLM uses its pre-trained knowledge and the retrieval data to generate a response, enhancing the overall quality of the output. As RAG sees wider adoption, ensuring robust performance evaluation becomes critical. While numerous automated methods, ranging from classic n-gram metrics (BLEU, ROUGE) and embedding-based measures (BERTScore)[4] to the \u201cLLM-as-a-judge\u201d approach leveraging GPT have been explored, an equally vital element is having the \u201cgolden\u201d evaluation set with sufficiently diverse and representative samples that will serve as a complete benchmark to evaluate both the retrieval and generation processes [5]. Furthermore, despite the emergence of multiple RAG benchmarks [6, 7, 8] that span general-purpose and specialized domains, many still fall short of reflecting the complexity and variability of",
    "with sufficiently diverse and representative samples that will serve as a complete benchmark to evaluate both the retrieval and generation processes [5]. Furthermore, despite the emergence of multiple RAG benchmarks [6, 7, 8] that span general-purpose and specialized domains, many still fall short of reflecting the complexity and variability of real-world use cases. In particular, traditional benchmarks often lack coverage of novel or underrepresented topics, limiting their ability to generalize [2, 9]. This gap poses a significant challenge for reliable evaluation, especially in domains requiring deep expertise and factual precision [10]. To address these challenges, a new line of work consisting in generating synthetic evaluation sets TRUST-AI: The European Workshop on Trustworthy AI. Organized as part of the European Conference of Artificial Intelligence - ECAI 2025. October 2025, Bologna, Italy. *Corresponding author. $ ilias.driouich@amadeus.com (I. DRIOUICH) \u00a9 2025 Copyright for this paper by its authors. Use permitted under Creative Commons License Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0). [11] has emerged and is very promising. Indeed, these methods offer a practical solution for generating datasets that mimic real human interactions by leveraging advanced LLM reasoning capabilities. Such synthetic datasets can include a broad range of scenarios, from straightforward factual questions to more nuanced domain-specific ones enabling robust and comprehensive evaluation of RAG systems. Additionally, synthetic data generation methods are increasingly recognized as vital components for the safe, transparent, and compliant evaluation of AI systems. In fact, regulatory frameworks, such as the European Union\u2019s AI Act [12], explicitly promote the use of synthetic datasets within AI compliance and auditing processes. However, maintaining both a high efficiency of privacy-preserving mechanisms in retrieval systems and adherence to privacy regulations remains essential to building reliable and ethical evaluation frameworks. In fact, according to the existing literature [13, 14], retrieval systems may face serious privacy issues when the retrieval process involves sensitive data. For example, the authors in [13] observe that carefully designed user prompts are able to extract original sentences from the retrieval data or can also extract specific pieces of private information, potentially leading to the leakage of considerable amounts of retrieval data. The potential risk of information leakage can significantly limit the applications of retrieval systems. For example, a medical chatbot [15] using patient history diagnosis cases as a source of knowledge can improve response quality but raises concerns about exposing sensitive patient information. In this work, we take the first step toward exploring the generation of diverse and privacy-aware synthetic QA datasets designed specifically to serve as evaluation ground truth for assessing RAG systems. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows: \u2022 We introduce a modular and extensible multi-agent pipeline for synthetic QA dataset generation, designed specifically for evaluating RAG systems",

Our main contributions can be summarized as follows: \u2022 We introduce a modular and extensible multi-agent pipeline for synthetic QA dataset generation, designed specifically for evaluating RAG systems while ensuring a balance between diversity, privacy, and utility. \u2022 We develop and perform a comprehensive twofold evaluation strategy: (1) diversity assessment combining qualitative judgments from LLM-based evaluators and quantitative diversity metrics, and (2) privacy assessment focused on the accuracy and effectiveness of entity masking across three specialized datasets. 2. Related works 2.1. Retrieval-augmented generation and privacy issues Retrieval-Augmented Generation , introduced by [16], has gained substantial traction for enhancing LLM responses through external context. By retrieving relevant documents or passages and incorporating them into the prompt, RAG often yields output with improved accuracy and factual grounding [17], mitigating the well-documented \u201challucination\u201d problem in LLMs [18]. In addition to higher-quality outputs, RAG offers architectural flexibility by allowing independent upgrades to any of its components (e.g., data storage, retriever, or the core LLM) without requiring full model retraining [19, 20]. These advantages have led to the adoption of RAG in diverse settings, from personal chatbots to highly specialized expert systems [21]. Despite its clear benefits, the retrieval process introduces privacy risks, particularly in domains handling sensitive user data. For instance, [22] highlight privacy implications of retrieval-based language models, showing how training data and user inputs can be unintentionally exposed through retrieved passages. Other works have demonstrated that RAG models are susceptible to extraction attacks [13], including membership inference and reconstruction attacks, which exploit learned representations to infer whether a user\u2019s data was part of the training set [23]. Such vulnerabilities pose significant challenges for deploying RAG-based solutions in sensitive applications (e.g., healthcare, finance) where data privacy is paramount. 2.2. Synthetic data generation using Large Language Models Recent advances in LLMs have created significant interest in using them to automatically generate synthetic data. For instance, [24, 25] utilize zero-shot prompting to produce synthetic samples for tasks such as text classification and question answering, subsequently training smaller models on this generated data. [26] introduce a noise-robust re-weighting framework to further refine data quality, while [27] propose mixing a set of soft prompts and applying prompt tuning to enhance diversity in the generated text. Beyond prompt-based methods, [28] examine specific attributes of the data itself, such as length and style, to diversify synthetic outputs. In parallel, a growing line of work has begun to address privacy concerns in synthetic data generation. The authors in [29] propose a few-shot approach, generating private in-context demonstrations backed by differential privacy guarantees, and [30] design a private evolution",

The authors in [29] propose a few-shot approach, generating private in-context demonstrations backed by differential privacy guarantees, and [30] design a private evolution algorithm that enforces differential privacy throughout the generation process. In [31], the authors propose a novel two-stage synthetic pipeline that includes attribute-based data generation, which aims to maintain key information, and iterative agent-based refinement, which further enhances the privacy of the input data in RAG systems. 2.3. Synthetic question answer generation (QAG) and RAG evaluation A new wave of QAG and RAG evaluation approaches is redefining the field through synthetic data generation and dynamic assessment methods powered by LLMs. Rather than relying on static, human- curated datasets, recent efforts leverage LLMs to generate QA pairs and evaluate model outputs using automated scoring mechanisms, such as LLM-as-a-judge frameworks. Systems like RAGAS [11] support scalable, domain-adaptable evaluation by conditioning synthetic QA generation on retrieved context and employing flexible, model-driven evaluation criteria. These methods offer the advantage of tailoring evaluation to specific domains and evolving data distributions. However, they also introduce new chal- lenges, including maintaining content diversity, ensuring output consistency, and protecting sensitive information, particularly when operating over proprietary or privacy-sensitive corpora. Our work builds upon this emerging paradigm by incorporating explicit mechanisms to address these concerns, contributing a privacy and and diversity-aware framework for RAG evaluation. 3. The proposed solution Algorithm 1 formally outlines the multi-agent procedure, detailing the sequential interaction between the diversity agent, privacy Agent, and QA curation agent. Given an input dataset \ud835\udc37and clustering hyperparameters, the process outputs a set of synthetic QA samples \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc34, enriched with semantic diversity and reinforced by privacy protections. In the first step, the Diversity agent clusters the original dataset using semantic embeddings and selects representative samples from each cluster, ensuring a broad coverage of topics. The second step, the privacy agent, operates over each cluster\u2019s representative samples, detecting and pseudonymizing sensitive entities to produce a private version of the data along with a structured privacy report. Finally, the QA curation agent synthesizes question-answer pairs from the private data, generating evaluation- ready samples along with a QA generation report that summarizes success rates and generation dynamics. 4.

Specifically, we used GPT-4o for the Diversity agent and the QA curation agent, due to its fast response time and strong gener- alization capabilities for content generation. For the privacy agent, we used GPT-4.1, which offers superior reasoning and tool-usage capabilities that are crucial for accurate PII detection and trans- formation tasks involving interaction with APIs or complex instructions. To ensure reproducibility and minimize variability in outputs, the temperature of all language models was fixed at 0 during inference. For the clustering process in the diversity agent, we generated embeddings using OpenAI\u2019s text-embedding-3-small (Ada 3) model with an embedding dimension of 1536. Input documents were preprocessed into chunks of 256 tokens before applying \ud835\udc58-means clustering. Agents tool configuration Each agent in the system operates with tailored tools suited to its objectives. First, the diversity agent uses a \ud835\udc58-means clustering function to identify latent topic clusters within the input document. The optimal value of \ud835\udc58is selected using intra-cluster distance scores. Second, the privacy agent performs pseudonymization based on a predefined set of PII categories. It scans the generated content, identifies sensitive entities, and replaces them using context-aware transformations. In addition, it produces a structured privacy report detailing which PIIs were correctly detected, masked, or missed. Last, the QA curator agent generates final QA pairs from the enriched, privacy-preserved inputs by leveraging advanced prompting techniques. It also produces a comprehensive generation report summarizing the types of QA pairs created, their alignment with source content, and overall dataset characteristics. 4.2.

It also produces a comprehensive generation report summarizing the types of QA pairs created, their alignment with source content, and overall dataset characteristics. 4.2. Research question 1: How does the proposed multi-agent system enhance the diversity of the generated evaluation dataset? 4.2.1. Baselines To assess the effectiveness of our proposed multi-agent approach in enhancing dataset diversity, we compare against two baselines: (1) Evolutionary generation (RagasGen). Inspired by works such as Evol-Instruct and RAGAS [11], this baseline uses an evolutionary generation paradigm to produce QA pairs. It iteratively mutates and refines questions to maximize diversity along dimensions such as reasoning complexity, multi-hop dependencies, and topic breadth. (2) Direct Prompting (DirPmpt). This baseline uses direct LLM prompting with few shot examples. A GPT-4o model is prompted with handcrafted instructions to produce diverse QA pairs. 4.2.2. Diversity evaluation dataset To evaluate our multi-agent framework\u2019s ability to generate diverse QA pairs, we use the official EU AI Act as input. Its rich structure and varied content provide a realistic and challenging testbed for assessing diversity in synthetic evaluation sets. 4.2.3. Diversity evaluation methodology To assess the diversity of the generated QA sets, we use the LLM-as-a-Judge approach, where GPT-4.1 is prompted to act as an expert evaluator. The model receives pairs of evaluation sets, our generated set and baseline sets, along with instructions to judge question diversity based on semantic variety, topical coverage, and phrasing differences. It then assigns diversity scores on a scale from 1 to 10. Additionally, we use the CosineSimilaritytoDiversity[32], which inverts the average pairwise cosine similarity of sentence embeddings, lower values indicate greater semantic spread. 4.2.4. Findings discussion First, we observe that our multi-agent system outperforms RagasGen and DirPrmpt in all evaluated settings, with consistent gains observed across both qualitative and quantitative metrics. Furthermore, we observe a consistent trend across all diversity measures: as the test set size increases, so does the diversity of the generated questions. The LLM-as-a-Judge scores (GPT-4.1) rise from 7.8 at 10 samples to 9 at 100 samples, indicating that the generated question sets increasingly exhibit richer topic coverage and variation in structure. Quantitatively, the CosineSim2toDiversity score becomes less negative (closer to zero), reflecting that questions are increasingly dissimilar to each other, a direct proxy for higher diversity. These results demonstrate that our multi-agent system enhances question diversity, particularly at larger scales.

Research Question 2: How does the proposed multi-agent solution preserve the overall privacy of the system? 4.3.1. Privacy evaluation datasets To evaluate the effectiveness of the privacy agent, we use three benchmark datasets provided by AI4Privacy1: PII-Masking-200K, PWI-Masking-200K, and PHI-Masking-200K. These tabular datasets contain long-form sentences annotated with private entities from different domains. The PWI dataset includes job titles, company names, and salary information. The PHI dataset focuses on medical diagnoses, genetic information, and gender. The PII dataset contains names, locations, dates of birth, and contact details. Each dataset also provides additional metadata such as entity type, position, and frequency. To simulate realistic input conditions for our pipeline, we concatenated individual samples from each dataset into longer text paragraphs. We refer to each resulting dataset as PWI, PHI, or PII. Each consists of domain-specific long sentences containing private entities and their corresponding masked versions. Table 2 summarizes the main statistics for each dataset, including document length and the number of private entities.

Experimental results In Figure 1 we present label-wise accuracy across the PHI, PWI, and PII datasets The privacy agent shows strong overall performance, with most labels achieving accuracies between 0.75 and 0.90. On the PHI dataset, the highest scores are observed for DISABILITYSTATUS (0.91), HOSPITALNAME (0.90), and MENTALHEALTHINFO (0.90), indicating robust handling of sensitive medical information. On the PWI dataset, the model performs best on JOBTYPE (0.94), TELEPHONENUM (0.90), and DATE, GENDER, SALARY, ORGANISATION, DBAREA (all 0.88), demonstrating high reliability in identifying entities related to the workplace. Moreover, results on the PII dataset highlight strong performance for LASTNAME (0.91), CARDNUMBER and CITY (0.87), and FIRSTNAME, STATE, and JOBAREA (all 0.86), confirming the agent\u2019s effectiveness in detecting general personal identifiers. Interestingly, overlapping labels such as GENDER appear across PHI (0.83), PWI (0.88), and PII (0.83), and yield consistently strong scores. This suggests that the privacy agent generalizes well across 1https://huggingface.co/ai4privacy domains. Figure 1: Privacy agent accuracy per entity type across the PHI, PWI, and PII datasets. 5.

Figure 1: Privacy agent accuracy per entity type across the PHI, PWI, and PII datasets. 5. Conclusion and future work In this work, we introduced a modular multi-agent framework for the generation of synthetic QA datasets tailored to the rigorous evaluation of RAG systems. Our approach decomposes the dataset construction process into distinct, specialized agents, each focused on enriching semantic diversity, enforcing privacy safeguards, and curating high-quality QA pairs. Through comprehensive experiments we highlight the framework\u2019s effectiveness in producing evaluation datasets that are both representative and privacy-preserving, addressing critical challenges in real-world RAG evaluation. Looking ahead, we aim to enhance the autonomy and collaboration of individual agents by leveraging tool-augmented foundation models. For example, the diversity agent could dynamically infer optimal clustering structures, while the privacy agent could adaptively identify and transform PIIs beyond static entity lists. In addition, we plan to explore agent-to-agent communication protocols and effective independent agent collaboration, potentially through frameworks like model context protocol, to improve coordination and task delegation among agents. Future work will also include rigorous evaluation of the framework\u2019s resilience to privacy attacks, helping to clarify its defensive boundaries and inform improvements. As AI regulations such as the EU AI Act continue to evolve, subsequent versions of our framework will further align synthetic evaluation set generation not only with principles of technical trustworthiness, but also with emerging regulatory requirements.

    "Affective Polarization across European Parliaments Bojan Evkoski 1, Igor Mozeti\u02c7c 2, Nikola Ljube\u0161i\u00b4c 2, 3, 4, Petra Kralj Novak 1, 2 1 Central European University, Vienna 2 Jo\u017eef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana 3 University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana 4 Insitute of Contemporary History, Ljubljana Correspondence: evkoski_bojan@phd.ceu.edu Abstract Affective polarization, characterized by in- creased negativity and hostility towards oppos- ing groups, has become a prominent feature of political discourse worldwide. Our study examines the presence of this type of polariza- tion in a selection of European parliaments in a fully automated manner. Utilizing a com- prehensive corpus of parliamentary speeches from the parliaments of six European coun- tries, we employ natural language processing techniques to estimate parliamentarian senti- ment. By comparing the levels of negativity conveyed in references to individuals from op- posing groups versus one\u2019s own, we discover patterns of affectively polarized interactions. The findings demonstrate the existence of con- sistent affective polarization across all six Euro- pean parliaments. Although activity correlates with negativity, there is no observed difference in affective polarization between less active and more active members of parliament. Fi- nally, we show that reciprocity is a contributing mechanism in affective polarization between parliamentarians across all six parliaments. 1 Introduction Political polarization, the widening gap between differing ideological groups, impacts governance, public discourse, and social unity. This division, powered by media echo chambers, confirmation biases, and identity politics, requires empathetic communication and evidence-based discussions to promote a more harmonious political landscape. Within political science literature, two primary categories of polarization mechanisms are widely recognized: ideological and affective polarization (Hohmann et al., 2023; Kubin and von Sikorski, 2021; Iyengar et al., 2019). Ideological polarization refers to the divergence of ideologies and a decline in dialogue among indi- viduals holding different views. Affective polariza- tion referes to the extent to which people have affin- ity towards their political allies (in-group members) and hostility towards their political opponents (out- group members) (Iyengar et al., 2012). Although these two forms of polarization can reinforce each other, they are distinct concepts both in terms of theoretical underpinnings and empirical measure- ments (Dias and Lelkes, 2022). While measuring ideological polarization relies on data about peo- ple\u2019s opinions on a certain topic, assessing affective polarization requires information about the emo- tional dynamics between groups (Druckman and Levendusky, 2019). Traditional studies on affective polarization pre- dominantly rely on public opinion polls to mea- sure individuals\u2019 negative feelings towards oppos- ing groups (Bettarelli et al., 2023; Kekkonen and Yl\u00e4-Anttila, 2021; Hobolt et al., 2021). Contem- porary approaches use automatic methods such as sentiment analysis to study affectiveness between structurally diverging groups on social platforms (Tyagi et al., 2020; Lerman et al., 2024). However, past research has typically focused on",
    "oppos- ing groups (Bettarelli et al., 2023; Kekkonen and Yl\u00e4-Anttila, 2021; Hobolt et al., 2021). Contem- porary approaches use automatic methods such as sentiment analysis to study affectiveness between structurally diverging groups on social platforms (Tyagi et al., 2020; Lerman et al., 2024). However, past research has typically focused on the general public rather than the behaviors and rhetoric of public political figures who play a crucial role in creating the public discourse itself (Matsubayashi, 2013). Healthy democracies thrive on the competition and negotiation between opposing sides inside in- stitutions such as parliaments. Political scientists emphasize that even contentious debates are prefer- able to the absence of dialogue, as frequent interac- tions between diverse viewpoints can help prevent the entrenchment of extreme polarization (Harris and Reilly, 1998). Therefore, it is essential to study affective polarization among politicians within po- litical elites. By doing so, we can understand the dynamics of political discourse and address affec- tive polarization before it becomes so entrenched that meaningful dialogue is no longer possible. With the emergence of big data collections from parliaments in recent years (Mollin, 2007; Erjavec 1 arXiv:2508.18916v1 [cs.CL] 26 Aug 2025 et al., 2023b; European Parliament, 2024) com- bined with the sophistication of automatic text pro- cessing tools, we have the opportunity to explore affective polarization of politicians on a new scale. In this work, we conduct a fully data-driven quan- titative assessment and analysis of affective polar- ization of members of parliaments (MPs) within six national European parliaments. We employ a methodology that combines an LLM-based senti- ment model fine-tuned on parliamentary speeches with named entity recognition and disambiguation to assess affectiveness of MPs towards one another. The goal of the approach is to estimate if nega- tivity of speeches is higher when directed toward members of opposing groups. We present three main findings. First, affective polarization does occur between Coalition and Op- position in all six studied European parliaments. Second, the more active parliamentarians exhibit higher levels of negativity with no observed differ- ence in their affective polarization. Third, we show that reciprocity is a contributing mechanism in the affective polarization between MPs. 2 Data We analyze transcriptions of speeches from parlia- ments of six European countries which exemplify all major regions of Europe: Denmark (Folketing, Northern Europe), France (Assembl\u00e9e nationale, Western Europe), Poland (Sejm, Central Europe), Serbia (Narodna Skup\u0161tina, South-Eastern Europe), Spain (Congreso de los Diputados, South-Western Europe) and Ukraine (Verkhovna Rada, Eastern Eu- rope). The transcriptions we use are part of the Par- laMint 4.0 dataset (Erjavec et al., 2023a,b), which is a collection of 29 multilingual corpora consisting of parliamentary debates from 2015 to mid-2022 (with several exceptions). The corpora are between 9 and 125 million",
    "and Ukraine (Verkhovna Rada, Eastern Eu- rope). The transcriptions we use are part of the Par- laMint 4.0 dataset (Erjavec et al., 2023a,b), which is a collection of 29 multilingual corpora consisting of parliamentary debates from 2015 to mid-2022 (with several exceptions). The corpora are between 9 and 125 million words in size and contain ex- tensive metadata, including information about the parliament, speakers, and speeches. The dataset also includes marked-up transcriber comments and additional information such as the speakers\u2019 year of birth and links to their Wikipedia pages. Lin- guistic annotations, such as tokenization, sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and syntac- tic dependencies are provided, along with named entity annotations. Table 1 shows the general statis- tics of the ParlaMint data of the six selected parlia- ments. For this study, we automatically label each Figure 1: Sentiment distribution of the Coalition and Op- position in six selected European parliaments. Asterisks represent the statistical significance in the comparison of the distributions using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. speech with a sentiment score using the ParlaSent multilingual large language model (LLM), an XLM-R RoBERTa model fine-tuned for sentiment analysis on parliamentary speeches in five lan- guages (Mochtak et al., 2023). Before applying the model, we perform minimal preprocessing by ex- cluding the first and last sentences of each speech, as they are typically procedural and positive but lack significant content. The output of the model is a continuous sentiment score from 0 (most nega- tive) to 5 (most positive). 3 Results 3.1 Sentiment Distribution Before presenting the assessment of affective polar- ization, we first show the sentiment distribution in parliamentary speeches delivered by both Coalition and Opposition MPs. Notably, there is a prevailing negative sentiment inclination in all six parliaments, with the median score falling below the neutral value of 2.5. Our results also show that in all six parliaments, the Opposition is significantly more negative than the Coalition (see Figure 1). The largest difference between Opposition and Coali- tion negativity is in the parliaments of France and Poland. Acknowledging the individuality of parliamen- tary customs, the diverse temporal scopes consid- ered for each parliament, as well as the variability in the performance of language tools, we refrain from conducting direct cross-parliament compar- isons of sentiment distributions. Instead, we invite the reader to observe each parliament individually, emphasizing the distinctions between Coalition and Opposition groups and their influence on affective polarization within each legislative body. 2 Sentiment DK kK K ok FR kK K ok [1 ~Coalition [+1 Opposition kK K ok RS kK K ok ES kK K ok UA kK K ok Table 1: General statistics of the analyzed data for the six selected parliaments.

To achieve this, we use the Named Entity tags embedded in the ParlaMint dataset to identify in-group and out-group entity references, with the inclusion of several steps of Named Entity disam- biguation (see the Appendix for details). We then calculate the sentiment scores of speeches directed towards the same group (e.g., a Coalition MP re- ferring to a Coalition MP) and towards the other group, respectively. We conduct separate assess- ments for the Coalition and the Opposition. The outcomes for Coalitions are depicted in Fig- ure 2, illustrating the comparison between the C2C sentiment distributions (a Coalition MP referring to a fellow Coalition MP) and the C2O sentiment distributions (a Coalition MP referring to an Oppo- sition MP). The results reveal that across five out of the six analyzed parliaments (Denmark being the exception), Coalitions exhibit greater negativity when referencing their Opposition. This trend is especially evident in France, Poland, and Spain, where intra-coalition discourse remains positive, contrasting sharply with the negative tone when mentioning their Opposition. These findings pro- vide evidence of political divisions characterized by dislike, which underscores the polarized nature of political communication. Similarly, we conduct an analogous examina- Figure 3: Sentiment distribution of the Opposition to- wards Opposition (O2O) and towards Coalition (O2C). tion for the Opposition, as illustrated in Figure 3, comparing the O2O sentiment distributions (an Op- position MP referring to an Opposition MP) and the O2C sentiment distributions (an Opposition MP referring to Coalition MP).

Despite generally smaller median differences, possibly due to the Opposition\u2019s inherent negative stance regardless of the target or topic, results show significant affective polarization of the Opposition for all parliaments, except France. 3.3 Individual Polarization and Activity We investigate whether more frequent debate par- ticipation leads to less negativity and reduced affec- tively polarized behavior by analyzing the relation- ship between the active participation of individual MPs and their levels of negativity and affective polarization. Up to this point, each speech has been treated as an independent entity, without considering the individuality of MPs. To address this, we calcu- late the sentiment scores for individual MPs and determine the affective polarization by subtracting the sentiment when an MP references the opposing group from the sentiment when referencing their own group. Results reveal a weak negative correlation be- tween activity levels of MPs and their sentiment across five out of six parliaments (Spain being the exception), with Spearman\u2019s rank correlation val- ues ranging from -0.21 in Serbia to -0.42 in Den- 3 Sentiment DK FR K ok 3K K ok 3K ; | C2C (| C20 RS K ok 3K ES K ok 3K UA K ok 3K Sentiment \u2014 DK oK 2 OK FR PL oK 2 OK [} O20 i 02C oK 2 OK oK 2 OK UA oK 2 OK mark. This indicates that MPs who deliver more speeches tend to express more negative sentiments. On the other hand, we observe no correlation be- tween activity levels of MPs and their affective po- larization. These results suggest that, although the less active MPs exhibit lower negativity, they ex- press similar levels of emotional division between Coalition and Opposition (shown in Figure 4). Figure 4: Correlations between activity levels, senti- ment, and affective polarization. More active MPs are typically more negative except for Spain where there is no significance. 3.4 Affective Reciprocity Lastly, we investigate whether reciprocity is present in the affective behavior of MPs towards each other, which could help explain overall affective polariza- tion. To assess reciprocity, we compute the Spear- man\u2019s rank correlation between the sentiment ex- pressed by one MP when referring to another and the sentiment expressed returned by the second MP, across all MP pairs. Results (shown in Table 2) suggest that weak to moderate positive reciprocity is present in all six parliaments, with French parliamentarians show- ing the highest reciprocity, and Danish the lowest. The presence of reciprocity alone does not inher- ently imply a positive or negative impact on democ- racy, as it heavily depends upon contextual factors.",

Re- sults reveal heightened negativity towards opposing groups in all six studied European parliaments, in- dicating the persistence of affective polarization. Additionally, we found that more active parliamen- tarians tend to be more negative overall; however, the levels of affective polarization do not correlate with parliamentary activity. We also observed that sentiment reciprocity is present in all six parlia- ments, potentially serving as a crucial mechanism for establishing affective polarization among par- liamentarians. Our approach involves a notable simplification: using the sentiment expressed in speeches when mentioning a person as a proxy for the sentiment directed towards that person. Depending on the cus- toms and language norms in each parliament, this may not always be accurate. Despite this limitation, the consistency of our results, which significantly exceeds mere noise, suggests the reliability of our method. This work highlights the usefulness of fully automated methods in analyzing complex social constructs like affective polarization. By leverag- ing NLP techniques on large-scale parliamentary datasets, we contribute to a deeper understanding of political communication dynamics and the mech- anisms underlying affective polarization within po- litical elites. Monitoring democracies through such indicators can provide an early warning mechanism for detecting signs of democratic erosion, helping to maintain democratic resilience. 4 Sentiment Affective Polarization Sentiment Affective Polarization OO NO Denmark Spearman: -0.42 (***) 0 1000 2000 Activity Serbia 0 500 1000 Activity France 3 | Spearman: -0.37 (***) \u00ae NO Sentiment Cc iS) ie .N \u00a9 O oO O 2 8 = <x @ 0 1000 Activity Spain 4 \u20ac 3 \u00a9 E c2 OF \u201d) 1 0 4 Affective Polarization 0 100 Activity Poland Spearman: -0.27,(***) e Sentiment Cc Oo \u00a9 IN fo Oo al \u00ae 2 3 Yo < 0) 500 Activity Ukraine Spearman: -0.34 (***) Sentiment Cc iS) ie .N \u00a9 O oO O 2 8 = <x 0 500",

IEEE. A Appendix - In-group and out-group member identification Accurately identifying references in parliamentary speeches is crucial in our methodology for mea- suring affective polarization. To start, we use Par- laMint\u2019s Named Entity Recognition (NER) tags to identify Personal Named Entities (PNEs) for in- dividuals referred to by speakers. We then match PNEs with current MPs by comparing the entire PNE string with full names using token set ra- tio matching. This strict criterion prevents false positives and ensures each mention is correctly at- tributed to a single MP. To validate our process, we manually reviewed 50 mentions per parliament. Over 90% of detected mentions correctly matched intended MPs, affirming our approach\u2019s reliability. Table 3 shows results of the reviewing. 5 Table 3: Statistics of mention detection in speeches of the six parliaments. Speeches with mentions are those that match exactly one MP in the parliament, excluding self-mentions and speeches mentioning both, coalition and opposition. Accuracy is the number of correctly identified mentions out of manually checked random samples of 50 speeches for each parliament.

    "Empowering Computing Education Researchers Through LLM-Assisted Content Analysis Laurie Gale Raspberry Pi Computing Education Research Centre University of Cambridge Cambridge, UK lpg28@cst.cam.ac.uk Sebastian M. Nicolajsen sebni@itu.dk Center for Computing Education Research IT University of Copenhagen Copenhagen, Denmark ABSTRACT Computing education research (CER) is often instigated by prac- titioners wanting to improve both their own and the wider dis- cipline\u2019s teaching practice. However, the latter is often difficult as many researchers lack the colleagues, resources, or capacity to conduct research that is generalisable or rigorous enough to advance the discipline. As a result, research methods that enable sense-making with larger volumes of qualitative data, while not increasing the burden on the researcher, have significant potential within CER. In this discussion paper, we propose such a method for conduct- ing rigorous analysis on large volumes of textual data, namely a variation of LLM-assisted content analysis (LACA). This method combines content analysis with the use of large language models, empowering researchers to conduct larger-scale research which they would otherwise not be able to perform. Using a computing education dataset, we illustrate how LACA could be applied in a reproducible and rigorous manner. We believe this method has po- tential in CER, enabling more generalisable findings from a wider range of research. This, together with the development of similar methods, can help to advance both the practice and research quality of the CER discipline.

She was certain the new approach to teaching CS1 had improved the course, but how could she convince the university? It would mean asking for more resources, and that re- quired more than just conviction. Hard numbers would have helped, but the grade data was still weeks away. All she had now was the tangle of student comments from the course evaluations\u2014subjective, scattered, and stubbornly resistant to quick conclusions, something which she did not have time for. Computing education (CE) and its associated research (CER) is a fast-growing independent discipline. Over the last few decades, we have strived to achieve better teaching, enabling more individuals to succeed in and outside of computing through computational means, as evident from the significant role which teaching, learning, course design, and student experiences play in our research [2, 34]. However, CER remains a young field which, in many ways, is still maturing.

A large corpus of CER studies remain to be experience reports, also spoken of as Genesis or Marco Polo papers \u2014 \u201cAnd he saw what he had made, and it was good\u201d, respectively, \u201cI went there and I saw this\u201d [34]. As our fictitious introductory story tells, proper analysis of teach- ing interventions, and other data collected in CER, is often a luxury. Small teams, a lack of research connections, or a primary allocation to teaching activities often make rigorous analysis unfeasible. How- ever, through proper, rigorous analyses of the many data points we often aggregate in our research \u2014 such as student feedback, video recordings, or log data \u2014 we can improve not only our under- standing of their effects in the classroom, but also our report to the research community. This is more important now than ever; with an increasing number of students being exposed to computing, there is a need for repeatable and generalisable research which allows us to scale and improve computing education across education levels and institutions. With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in qual- itative research across domains, we stand with a new opportunity as computing education teachers and researchers. More in-depth analyses can now be conducted with fewer resources, so long as LLMs are used carefully and intentionally. This discussion paper proposes LLM-assisted content analysis (LACA), which harnesses the power of LLMs within the broader method of content analysis. Specifically, LLMs are used for performing deductive coding, with the researcher responsible for deductively or inductively generating the codebook. To show a potential application of LACA, we provide an example case study with a computing education dataset. The use of LACA empowers researchers to analyse large sets of textual data that they would not otherwise be feasible. This particularly benefits computing educators lacking the ability to rigorously in- vestigate the effect of their intervention and researchers analysing large bodies of student or teacher text with content analysis. We believe this to be particularly important now, as existing overarching methods for LLM use in qualitative methods are lack- ing, making it easy and tempting for researchers to not disclose their usage. Thus, if we want to conduct trustworthy, repeatable, and ethical research with LLMs, adherence to rigorous research methods is vital. LACA is a step towards this. arXiv:2508.18872v1 [cs.CL] 26 Aug 2025 2 CONTENT ANALYSIS Content analysis (CA) is a method for analysing textual data that has developed over many decades.

LACA is a step towards this. arXiv:2508.18872v1 [cs.CL] 26 Aug 2025 2 CONTENT ANALYSIS Content analysis (CA) is a method for analysing textual data that has developed over many decades. It has since expanded into a large umbrella of methods which have been frequently used to analyse a range of textual and non-textual data. Within CER, CA has been applied to a wide range of rich data types, addressing a vast portfolio of different research questions ( e.g., [10, 21, 32]). Before explaining how LLMs can be used in CA, we first define what CA is and justify why LLMs are appropriate to use. 2.1 Definitions and Key Principles We use Krippendorff [14] and Neuendorf [22] as well-respected CA guides for situating and developing LACA. They define content analysis as the following1: Content analysis is a research technique for making replicable and valid inferences from texts (or other meaningful matter) to the contexts of their use. - Krippendorff [14, p. 18] Content analysis is a summarizing, quantitative analysis of mes- sages that follows the standards of the scientific method (in- cluding attention to objectivity\u2013intersubjectivity, a priori design, reli- ability, validity, generalizability, replicability, and hypothesis testing based on theory) and is not limited as to the types of variables that may be measured or the context in which the messages are created or presented. - Neuendorf [22, p. 22] Based on these, there are some key principles of CA, which are described in more detail in Neuendorf\u2019s six-part definition of CA. First, content analysis is concerned with analysing messages. These messages do not have to be textual but must contain some \u201cmeaning\u201d [14, 22], allowing a wide range of media to be analysed. Within CER, this has enabled CA to be performed on a wealth of textual and non-textual data, such as interview transcripts [10, 28], video recordings of students [21], and programming data [12, 32, 35]. Second, content analysis was originally developed as a quantita- tive method for summarising data. The typical output of content analyses is a codebook containing counts for different categories. These can facilitate further statistical analysis, comparison with related work, or greater understanding of a phenomenon. Qualita- tive versions of content analysis methods are now widely accepted and used (.e.g, [18]), which differ in how the codebook is produced. This is common in CER (e.g., [10, 21, 32]), perhaps due to the lack of preexisting CER to base codebooks on. For codebooks derived using CA to be considered useful, content analyses must be conducted with sufficient rigour and reproducibil- ity. This brings us to arguably the most important principle of CA: it abides by the principles of the scientific method. This involves using hypothesis",
    "preexisting CER to base codebooks on. For codebooks derived using CA to be considered useful, content analyses must be conducted with sufficient rigour and reproducibil- ity. This brings us to arguably the most important principle of CA: it abides by the principles of the scientific method. This involves using hypothesis testing and prior theory where appropriate, so as to build on previous work, and ensuring suitable validity and reliability, such as reaching acceptable interrater reliability values. All of this should be sufficiently detailed to allow others to replicate, which is often lacking in CER and beyond. 1Emphasis by the authors of this paper. 2.2 The Limitations of Content Analysis Based on these principles, a key goal of CA is to generalise findings to a wider population than the sample in question [22]. This requires appropriate sampling as well as sufficient validity and reliability. Over time, repeatedly conducting larger-scale and more general- isable content analyses brings about quicker and more significant advances in the research field, improving our understanding and benefitting practice. Unfortunately, conducting generalisable CA is often difficult in CER. First, computing education researchers often lack the per- sonnel to conduct sufficiently large content analyses \u2014 here the number of coders, rather than the amount of data, is typically a factor limiting the volume of data that can be coded. Second, re- searchers may lack the time to conduct sufficiently rigorous CA, especially if they are analysing other data in the same study. Even if there were sufficient time and resources, coordinating large-scale content analyses adds an organisational burden and becomes harder to ensure reliability. 2.3 Why LLMs Can Help We believe the use of LLMs in CA can enable researchers and educators to perform analysis that they would not otherwise be able to perform. Just as importantly, we believe that LLMs can be used in a methodologically sound manner that conforms to the principles of CA for several reasons. First, the principles of the scientific method, particularly reliabil- ity, validity, and replicability, can be adhered to when using LLMs in CA. During the process of deductive coding, LLMs can effectively replace the role of human coders, making measures of reliability and validity verifiable in the same way. Interrater reliability (IRR) measures, for example, function the same regardless of how the codes for a set of data were generated. To facilitate replicability, details of the LLM can be reported, such as the model, prompt, and dates of experiments [30, 36]. Additionally, the task of deductive coding in content analysis suits the capabilities of LLMs. Codebooks should contain instruc- tions, examples, definitions, and anything else that allows human coders to reliably code the same data [22]. These elements of a clearly",

Additionally, the task of deductive coding in content analysis suits the capabilities of LLMs. Codebooks should contain instruc- tions, examples, definitions, and anything else that allows human coders to reliably code the same data [22]. These elements of a clearly defined codebook also enable LLMs to reliably code data, especially when combined with appropriate prompt engineering techniques [16, 19]. There is already some evidence to suggest that LLMs can perform such deductive coding with good interrater relia- bility [6, 15, 19] and do not perform well on categories that humans struggle to reliably code [15, 16]. A consequence of this is arguably positive; LLMs will not code as reliably if the codebook provided is not sufficiently detailed, which encourages researchers to use clearly defined codebooks. Not only can LLMs follow clear human instructions, the sum- marising nature of CA is well suited to LLMs. While some inter- pretation may be required, CA is \u2018less in-depth and detailed\u2019 in the interest of reliability and generalisability [22]. Performing coding where LLMs are required to perform interpretation or have more contextual knowledge can yield unreliable results [16], which can also be the case with humans [22]. This is not useful when trying to assess counts or perform other statistical analyses. 2 2.4 How LLMs Can Help Based on the considerations in the previous sections, we believe LLMs best serve as deductive coding agents in CA. This application of LLMs serves several benefits, particularly for researchers lacking time, colleagues, or resources. One obvious advantage of using LLMs is scale. In traditional CA, the number of researchers limits the sample of texts that can be analysed [14]. As long as the principles of CA are followed, it can be applied to very large datasets; one example in Neuendorf [22] includes a CA of 31 million words involving 31 coauthors/coders. Provided with a suitable codebook, LLMs can perform vast amounts of coding, hugely expanding the amount a single or small group of researchers can analyse. No longer is the number of researchers the limit for the amount of data CA can be performed on. An associated benefit is speed. Even if one did have a group of 31 trained coders, the analysis would take time to perform. This is not ideal for quick scoping analyses or researchers pressured by time, perhaps due to teaching commitments. LLMs, on the other hand, can perform deductive coding much quicker than humans. Where justification is required to resolve disagreements and improve relia- bility, chain-of-thought reasoning can also help to identify coding patterns in the LLM [1]. 3 LLM-ASSISTED CONTENT ANALYSIS We now propose LLM-assisted content analysis (LACA), an instance of",

Where justification is required to resolve disagreements and improve relia- bility, chain-of-thought reasoning can also help to identify coding patterns in the LLM [1]. 3 LLM-ASSISTED CONTENT ANALYSIS We now propose LLM-assisted content analysis (LACA), an instance of content analysis that incorporates LLMs for the purposes of deductive coding. This builds on an existing method of the same name [6], with extensions related to methodological and ethical rigour. Unlike other aspects of qualitative and content analyses, we believe the use of LLMs is methodologically compatible with and technically proficient at the deductive aspect of content anal- ysis. Conversely, we do not believe LLMs can effectively perform more interpretive forms of qualitative analysis or inductive code generation. Figure 1 visualises the LACA process. In this section, we outline the process and exemplify the individual steps using a fictitious worked example. While the example is not complete, we provide all the necessary documentation for conducting it in an online repository [23]. With LACA, we highly emphasise how the steps prior to the use of an LLM are crucial in ensuring proper, ethical application. In particular, researchers should consider whether applying LACA is a suitable approach to use, and inform potential participants and ethical committees. Generally, we recommend local models, in accordance with ethical recommendations [30], especially if the application of LACA is decided post data collection. The example we demonstrate LACA on is a continuation of Si- mon and Sheard\u2019s research, who sought to analyse two decades of papers at the Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE) conference. The data set includes abstracts from publications from SIGCSE TS (7936), ITiCSE (3154), ICER (730), TOCE (334), Koli Calling (316), GCE (103). The data set was ag- gregated using Semantic scholar.2 The full data set is accessible through the link to our example [23]. 2https://www.semanticscholar.org Decision point Repeat until agreement Repeat until agreement or fatigue Determine collection strategy and consent Justify the use of LLMs as a methodological approach.

Figure 1: The LACA Process This research relates to a larger body of work that has explored CER\u2019s growth as a discipline, including the use theory, methods and statistics (e.g., [17, 26, 29, 33]). Many of these studies have used CA to conduct their analysis, which will naturally become harder as the CER discipline grows. We therefore use this example due to the number of publications outweighing the capability of human coding involved and the dataset being easily acquirable. From here on, text related to this example will appear in italics. Step 1 First, one should consider whether LACA is an appropri- ate choice of method for the research to be conducted. This includes considering the complexity of the data aggregated and whether alternative types of analysis may perform better. One should also consider the model of choice; local models increase privacy while remote models may collect data and be more expensive. However, large local LLMs may take significant time to complete generating responses, depending on the machine available. In the case of our example, we are analysing abstracts, looking for certain themes emerging. Here, we first consider whether a simple analysis based on word occurrence will suffice. However, after manual exploration of some of the data, we found that different abstracts utilise a wide array of words to describe different concepts, which we cannot guarantee to catch by simply utilising word lists. We also realise that the complexity of abstracts can be significant, and thus opt for one of the larger local LLMs. In this case, we use gemma 3 27B as this can be run on a mid-range MacBook Pro M3. We do not consider any anonymisation procedures as the data under investigation will 3 contain no sensitive data. Step 2 Then, one should construct the codebook. It is important to state that the LACA process does not provide any particular means to do this. Instead, researchers should opt for a method of codebook generation which is appropriate for the research. Sec- ond, one should consider a representative sample",
    "Step 2 Then, one should construct the codebook. It is important to state that the LACA process does not provide any particular means to do this. Instead, researchers should opt for a method of codebook generation which is appropriate for the research. Sec- ond, one should consider a representative sample to execute the preliminary human review of and decide on an appropriate IRR measure to use, such as Cohen\u2019s \ud835\udf05[20], Krippendorff\u2019s \ud835\udefc[13]. Two or more reviewers should then conduct the content analysis based on the designed codebook, and iteratively improve the codebook to achieve an acceptable level of inter-rater reliability. Given that we are extending the work by Simon & Sheard [34], we opt to design the codebook for this example by reusing their descrip- tion of themes, and including the themes which they identify in the study, as most prominent [23]. For the sake of illustration, the themes include, but are not limited to; \u201cTeaching/learning techniques\u201d, \u201cTeach- ing/learning tools\u201d, \u201cRecruitment, progression, pathways\u201d, and \u201cGen- der issues\u201d. Using this, two reviewers would code a random sample of 1,257 abstracts (10%) to determine the quality of the codebook. Dis- cussing disagreements, we would revise the codebook and continue until inter-rater reliability was high enough to constitute agreement. For this, we decide on utilising a variation of Krippendorff\u2019s \ud835\udefcwhich allows each reviewer to assign multiple codes to a single data point, and strive for an \ud835\udefc-value above 0.80, as recommended by Krippendorff [14] Step 3 Based on your findings from step 2 , you should con- sider whether LACA is still appropriate. It can, therefore, be appro- priate to include additional information during the human coding. This could include comparative indicators such as how weak or strong individual codings are compared to others, to help assert the appropriateness of the method, as described in Section 2.4. Given the fictitious nature of our example, we assume a Krippendorff\u2019s \ud835\udefchigher than our threshold of 0.80 was achieved through dialogue about disagreements and iterations on the codebook. Given the direct- ness of the themes and the high IRR, we assume continuing with a large context local LLM is feasible. Step 4 The next step is employing an LLM to conduct the analysis on the same sample as the human coders, and then, calculate the IRR between human and LLM. The prompt from which we start is simply the codebook used in the previous stages. If the IRR achieved initially is not above the selected threshold, one should refine the codebook (now prompt) by inspecting the resulting analysis. It is here important to recognise that, despite laudable efforts and many iterative cycles, the LLM may never reach IRR which is above the pre-defined acceptable threshold. We",
    "the IRR achieved initially is not above the selected threshold, one should refine the codebook (now prompt) by inspecting the resulting analysis. It is here important to recognise that, despite laudable efforts and many iterative cycles, the LLM may never reach IRR which is above the pre-defined acceptable threshold. We refer to this as fatigue. Thus, it is important to monitor whether the IRR stagnates despite changes to the prompt. In these cases, one should reconsider not moving forward with LACA. If one does continue, there are many ways to design an analysis \u2018flow\u2019 that illustrates the LACA process in a transparent and repeat- able manner. For this purpose, we developed a small library [24] and no-code solution [25] which allows users to conduct LACA programmatically. In particular, the library is designed to record the flow of analysis, so as to increase transparency of what trans- formations the data goes through. To conduct the LLM analysis on the sample coded by humans, we de- sign a workflow in our visual tool [25], which automatically produces a shareable codebook and allows us to compare the human-coded data, saved as a JSON file, with that generated by the LLM, saved as a CSV file. We make some minor changes to the codebook (see [23]), so that we can more easily execute the modified Krippendorff\u2019s alpha previously mentioned (also implemented by the tool). Figure 2 illustrates the specific flow. First, the abstracts 1 and human codes 2 are imported. Then, we apply the LLM prompt on each abstract 3 and modify the output to make it comparable to the human codes 4 . We then compare the human codes to the LLM codes using the chosen IRR measure 5 , and save both the LLM generated codes 6 and the IRR value 7 . We then simply run the flow, modify the prompt as needed depending on the IRR produced, and continue until acceptable IRR is achieved on the sample. Step 5 Based on whether the LLM is capable of reaching accept- able IRR with the human codings, decide on the next action. If the IRR is acceptable, you move on to step 6 . If not, reevaluate whether LACA is appropriate, potentially returning to step 2 to revisit your codebook (not prompt), design, and choice of LLM. Based on our fictitious example, we assume that after a series of itera- tions, the prompt achieves acceptable IRR, and we therefore continue to step 6 . Step 6 Now, utilise the LLM to code the entire dataset. The anal- ysis flow should be equivalent to the analysis in Step 5 and be reflected in any reporting of LACA. In the case of our example,",
    "prompt achieves acceptable IRR, and we therefore continue to step 6 . Step 6 Now, utilise the LLM to code the entire dataset. The anal- ysis flow should be equivalent to the analysis in Step 5 and be reflected in any reporting of LACA. In the case of our example, the analysis flow, generated from our tool, is run on the entire data set, excluding the comparison component (see [23]). Step 7 In line with existing guidelines on reporting LLM use in qualitative research [30] and research generally [36], it is cru- cial to report details regarding the LLM used and the particular choices made within the LACA process. There are many things one could report. We recommend that one reports; 1) that an LLM was used to perform content analysis; 2) the choice of model and version (i.e., open-source or proprietary model, local or remote); 3) data anonymisation procedures; 4) Sampling sizes; 5) IRR mea- sure used and final values for both human-human and human-LLM comparisons; and 6) the codebook and analysis flow used. Some of this information need not documenting in the main body of the paper. More intricate details for precise replication of the study can be included as an appendix or in an open study repository. 4 Figure 2: Illustration of LLM workflow in our custom no-code tool for doing programmatic analysis with local LLMs. Based on the analysis conducted as part of our example, one could report all of the above in a similar way to the following (but including IRR values explictly): We applied LLM-Assisted Content Analysis. First, designing a code- book using sections of Simon and Sheard [34] (see Appendix A), and refining this based on the IRR (A modified version of Krippendorff\u2019s \ud835\udefcto support multiple codes from each reviewer) achieved by two re- viewers coding a random sample of 1,257 publications (10%). We then utilised a local Gemma 27B model to analyse each abstract in the sample, comparing it to the human codes using the same IRR method as before, and achieved a high \ud835\udefc-value, implying agreement between humans and the LLM (\ud835\udefc> 0.80). Then, we conducted the LLM-based analysis on the entire dataset (12,573 publication abstracts), which lays the foundation of our findings. The flow of analysis is visualised in Figure 1. For the codebook and LLM analysis flow, see Appendix B. 4 EXISTING QUALITATIVE APPROACHES WITH LLMS The applications of LLMs to qualitative research has unsurprisingly been widely investigated in the last few years. However, much of the work resides outside of computing education research.

    "LLMs to qualitative research has unsurprisingly been widely investigated in the last few years. However, much of the work resides outside of computing education research. The research which does exist in computing education employs complex analysis such as combining multiple existing methods, including using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to extract rationales in publications [31]. While Schulte et al. [31] also contribute a custom library to conduct similar analysis to theirs, they do not explicitly incorporate IRR in their method, explicitly consider the ethical considerations outlined by Schroeder et al. [30], or provide instructional guidelines to recreate their method.3 Thus, we here provide a brief overview of some general areas of application, as well as some ethical and methodological objections. We do not provide a comprehensive report given the large traction LLM use has gained in qualitative research. Further, we do not report on \u2018traditional\u2019 NLP approaches, e.g., fine-tuning of BERT 3While instructional guidelines are not expected, it underlines the need for method- oriented publications. models, as the purpose of this research is to make NLP approaches more accessible for researchers. Several works have tried to integrate LLMs into existing quali- tative methods to develop new methodological contributions. An example of this is LATA, or LLM-assisted thematic analysis [37], which aims to incorporate LLMs into the process of thematic anal- ysis as defined by Braun and Clarke [4]. LLMs are involved in inductively generating open codes, searching for themes, and cod- ing using the final set of themes. The use of LLMs application to TA has similarly been applied by De Paoli and Mathis [7], who look to assess valid uses of LLMs. However, the process of inductive theme generation by LLMs is arguably methodologically opposed to the principles of reflexive thematic analysis. Researchers\u2019 expe- riences, background, and interpretations are key aspects of a TA procedure [5], which LLMs do not possess. Performing interrater reliability measures, as these articles do, is also opposed to reflexive TA [5]. More generally, we are methodologically opposed to the use of LLMs for any inductive code generation that does not involve humans. Inductive code generation requires good understanding of the research questions and immersion in the data. These research questions will evolve based on the analysis, requiring coders to be adaptable and reflexive. We believe such creativity in analysis is unique to humans. More work investigates the ability of LLMs to deductively code data. That is, where LLMs are provided with a codebook rather than prompted to generate one. In this case, if the codes are reli- able enough, LLMs can simply replace the role of a trained coder who has not conducted any of the prior research. Initial research shows promise in terms of speed",

Other studies have found that, for some codes, LLMs\u2019 \u2018performance\u2019 is similar to humans [6, 15, 19]. However, \u2018performance\u2019 is often measured with a confu- sion matrix rather than IRR values, which is more of a \u2018traditional\u2019 NLP approach to evaluation. 5 5) Import abstracts 4 simplifiedcodedsample json \u00a9 a Make list of LLM generated codes \u2018Bi EP) &)] Import human codings # simplifiedcodedsample.json 7 S@ J Compare codings x \\S G Save alpha output \u2014 5 (6 Save LLM codings & Ilm-simon-analysis \u00bb /Users/sebni/Documents/Repositories/discussion-paper-analysis/outputs \u00bb /Users/sebni/Documents/Repositories/discussion-paper-analysis/outputs 5 APPLICATIONS, LIMITATIONS, AND REFLECTIONS We argue that CER is a fruitful discipline for conducting LACA. Not only is content analysis frequently used within CER, many mem- bers of the CER community are intertwining their teaching with their research, or lack the resources to perform medium-large scale analysis of textual data often collected from participants. LACA provides a method for analysing such data, even when researchers do not have the capacity to manually inspect it all themselves. The sort of data that arises from these experiences varies widely, providing many good applications of LACA within CER. For ex- ample, educators of large undergraduate courses may have a large number of students\u2019 written feedback from which they wish to identify students\u2019 struggles or conceptions (e.g., [9, 11, 27]). LACA could be performed to speed up the coding of this process, as well as enable aggregation of data over multiple institutions. Alternatively, CER researchers may, for example, wish to categorise students\u2019 programming data to understand common patterns in program- ming behaviour (e.g., [12, 32, 35]). Applying LACA again increases the number of logs which could be analysed [15], complementing quantitative data obtained. As another example, tool developers may wish to analyse masses of textual student data inputted into their tool to, for example, summarise common misconceptions or demonstrate the efficacy of their tool. The purpose of these examples is not to provide an exhaustive list of applications, but rather a starting point to motivate the range of CER that LACA enables. In doing this, however, we also acknowl- edge a limitation of LACA: the range of data used in CER is much more varied than the textual data that is appropriate for LACA. CER researchers have also analysed visual data [3], video recordings of students",
    "range of CER that LACA enables. In doing this, however, we also acknowl- edge a limitation of LACA: the range of data used in CER is much more varied than the textual data that is appropriate for LACA. CER researchers have also analysed visual data [3], video recordings of students [21], and even physical data from students [8]. Future work involves expanding the application of LACA beyond textual data to enable a wider range of large-scale analysis. Another limitation of the current version of LACA is the lack of clarity around when to stop. While we acknowledge the possibility fatigue, we do not know how to reliably verify whether this has happened. In other words, if a researcher(s) has already repeated step 4 five times, should they do it again? We believe certain heuristics in future applications of LACA will help to determine this. Either way, continuous iteration and trial-and-error situations may inadvertently make LACA more time-consuming than general content analysis (depending on the data, codebook, and utilised model). The final limitation we note is the uncertainty of what data LACA performs well on. While our example in Section 3 includes relatively short-form data which is easy to code, it is not entirely clear what sort of data favours the use of LLM coding. Related work indicates that LLMs can code more concrete concepts [15, 19]. However, the lack of clarity around suitable data clouds the judgment required for step 1 and step 3 . Based on our current experiments and existing research, we suspect LLMs will perform better on short- to medium-form textual data. The longer the text, the more complex coding becomes, the more interpretation generally required, and the more margin for error. Accurate coding is likely to decrease as the length and importance of context increase. As a consequence of our limitations, a core strand of our further work is the use of LACA in many situations where we envision it to be of benefit. As CER researchers, we wish to start with applica- tions within our rich field. As well as enabling previously unfeasible research, each deployment of the LACA method serves as an op- portunity to learn more about what sort of textual data it can be performed on. interactive rebase in progress; onto b6e3dafThis includes details about the type of data, the complexity of the code- book, and the amount of contextual knowledge required to perform coding.

These areas of future work will inform both the technical and methodological aspects of LACA 6 CONCLUSION Computing education research (CER) is a healthy community con- sisting of researchers from a wide range of disciplines, backgrounds, and experiences. However, it is still a young field, with the rigour and generalisability of findings within the field often limited by the number or capacity of people to analyse data. In this discussion paper, we have proposed a methodological solution to this problem within the context of textual data through LLM-assisted content analysis (LACA). Not only does LACA enable researchers to con- duct larger-scale analysis quicker, it also encourages this to be done in a repeatable and rigorous manner. We hope this paper can be used to encourage the responsible and reliable use of LACA, and LLMs more generally, within the CER community.

    "REFLECTIVEPROMPT: REFLECTIVE EVOLUTION IN AUTOPROMPTING ALGORITHMS Viktor N. Zhuravlev Artur R. Khairullin Ernest A. Dyagin Alena N. Sitkina Nikita I. Kulin Computer Technologies Laboratory ITMO University Saint-Petersburg, Russia 334857@niuitmo.ru 242106@niuitmo.ru 368983@niuitmo.ru August 27, 2025 ABSTRACT Autoprompting is the process of automatically selecting optimized prompts for language models, which has been gaining popularity with the rapid advancement of prompt engineering, driven by extensive research in the field of large language models (LLMs). This paper presents Reflective- Prompt1 \u2014 a novel autoprompting method based on evolutionary algorithms that employs a reflective evolution approach for more precise and comprehensive search of optimal prompts. ReflectivePrompt utilizes short-term and long-term reflection operations before crossover and elitist mutation to en- hance the quality of the modifications they introduce. This method allows for the accumulation of knowledge obtained throughout the evolution process and updates it at each epoch based on the current population. ReflectivePrompt was tested on 33 datasets for classification and text generation tasks using open-access large language models: t-lite-instruct-0.1 and gemma3-27b-it. The method demonstrates, on average, a significant improvement (e.g., 28% on BBH compared to EvoPrompt) in metrics relative to current state-of-the-art approaches, thereby establishing itself as one of the most effective solutions in evolutionary algorithm-based autoprompting. Keywords AutoPrompting \u00b7 LLM \u00b7 NLP \u00b7 Reflective Evolution \u00b7 prompt 1 Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant results in solving Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks [34, 11]. Prompting and prompt engineering are universal methods for improving the performance of LLMs that do not require access to model weights and gradients during training. Instead, they enhance the efficiency of LLM inference by providing carefully crafted and well-structured instructions (prompts) as input to the model [18]. Currently, there are many different prompting techniques, such as Few-Shot [2], Role-Based [33], Chain-of-Thought [35], Plan-and-Solve [32], and others. What all these techniques have in common is that they can be time-consuming to manually create, iterate, and optimize, often requiring expert knowledge and experience. The reason for this is that models are highly sensitive to input data, necessitating careful and precise application of these techniques [14]. Autoprompting addresses this issue by automating the generation and selection of prompts [28]. It is based on various optimization methods and principles, including reinforcement learning, evolutionary, gradient-based, and gradient-free approaches, among others [28, 13, 8, 22]. In particular, prompt optimization can be either discrete or continuous [26]. Continuous optimization involves representing the prompt as a numerical tensor, while discrete optimization treats the prompt as a sequence of tokens. The latter approach offers several advantages: it does not require derivative computations, meaning there is no need to access the model\u2019s internal parameters and gradients. This allows working with black-box models and avoids additional computational overhead [19].",

Additionally, it preserves prompt 1Code available as a part of CoolPrompt framework library: https://github.com/CTLab-ITMO/CoolPrompt/ arXiv:2508.18870v1 [cs.CL] 26 Aug 2025 ReflectivePrompt: Reflective evolution in autoprompting algorithms interpretability, enabling humans to analyze and edit them [19], and allows optimization for any metric (including non-differentiable ones) [8, 15, 21, 6]. However, this approach also has challenges: the optimization space for prompts is vast, and prompts generated through search methods may lack diversity [8]. Nevertheless, there are numerous heuristic optimization algorithms that employ stochastic strategies, making the optimization process less sensitive to local optima. Evolutionary algorithms are one such example [4]. In this work, we analyzed the Reflective Evolution algorithm [36] and integrated it to address the problem of automatic prompt generation. The resulting solution, called ReflectivePrompt, was tested on 33 datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness compared to existing methods. 1.1 Evolutionary algorithms Evolutionary algorithms are a family of optimization methods based on the principles of biological evolution: natural selection, mutation, crossover, and inheritance. These algorithms operate with populations of solutions, gradually improving them according to a given fitness function [18]. Among such algorithms, the genetic algorithm [9] can be distinguished, which works with gene sequences (in our case, sequences of phrases in prompts). Within this algorithm, starting with an initial population of individuals, selection, crossover of selected individuals (creating offspring based on a combination of parental information), mutation of the offspring (random modification of certain parts), and population update based on offspring evaluations are performed iteratively. This approach is highly flexible when applied to problems from various domains. The usage of evolutionary operators (crossover, mutation) and population-based search reduces the risk of getting stuck in local optima, maintaining a balance between exploring new solutions and exploiting existing ones, thereby leading to a high diversity of individuals in the final population while ensuring their quality according to the objective function remains high [8, 15, 21, 6]. 1.2 Related works One solution employing genetic algorithms is EvoPrompt [8]. The improvement of the candidate prompt population occurs iteratively through selection, evolution (generation of new candidates using evolutionary operators), and population updates based on the evaluation of new candidates. The implementation of evolutionary operators (mutation and crossover) is achieved through queries to an LLM, enabling the utilization of its expertise in solving NLP tasks while maintaining prompt readability. During new candidate generation, two parents are first selected from the previous population using roulette-wheel selection (selection phase) [16],",
    "new candidates. The implementation of evolutionary operators (mutation and crossover) is achieved through queries to an LLM, enabling the utilization of its expertise in solving NLP tasks while maintaining prompt readability. During new candidate generation, two parents are first selected from the previous population using roulette-wheel selection (selection phase) [16], followed by the application of crossover and subsequent mutation of the resulting offspring. The study also presents a differential evolution algorithm [23], which involves mutating different segments of two donor prompts from the same population, combining them with a mutating candidate, and performing crossover with the current best prompt. The authors\u2019 position EvoPrompt as a general framework for integrating LLMs into evolutionary algorithms, with experimental results demonstrating that differential evolution exhibits superior performance on more complex tasks. SPELL [15] employs a genetic algorithm operating iteratively through repeated reproduction and selection steps, where selection is performed via roulette-wheel while reproduction involves generating offspring based on a list of parent prompts and their corresponding scores. Notably, although reproduction is also conducted through LLM queries, this solution lacks explicit separation between crossover and mutation. Instead, it utilizes a predefined prompt instructing modifications to the parent prompt set (replacing, adding, or deleting words, altering tone) to generate offspring. An alternative approach implemented in Plum [21] is based on metaheuristics. Unlike EvoPrompt\u2019s prompt mu- tation methodology, Plum explicitly defines a set of prompt modification operations: adding, deleting, rephrasing words/phrases, or swapping their positions, thereby generating multiple neighboring prompts. The solution architecture comprises: a well-defined set of neighboring prompts for each prompt, a metaheuristic algorithm with its inherent hyperparameters, and auxiliary functions (including crossover). The study examines six algorithms: hill climbing [10], simulated annealing [25], genetic algorithm (two variants - with mutation and crossover, and mutation-only) [9], tabu search [5], and harmony search [31]. Each algorithm performs candidate mutation through the application of predefined modification operations, enabling exploration within the discrete prompt space. It should be noted that only the rephrasing operation is executed via LLM queries, while other operations are performed manually. As described by the authors, experimental results demonstrate this approach\u2019s capability to identify novel structural prompt modifications that enhance performance. In Promptbreeder [6] paper, the authors propose an extended genetic algorithm mutation approach incorporating predefined mutation prompts and \"thinking styles\" (concise descriptions of cognitive strategies, e.g., \"Let\u2019s think step by step\"), in addition to utilizing Chain-of-Thought [35] and Plan-and-Solve [32] techniques. At each iteration, candidates 2 ReflectivePrompt: Reflective evolution in autoprompting algorithms are improved through the application of a randomly selected mutation from a uniform distribution. The authors identify five mutation classes: direct mutation, hypermutation, estimation of distribution mutation [20], Lamarckian mutation [24], and prompt crossover/context shuffling.

    "iteration, candidates 2 ReflectivePrompt: Reflective evolution in autoprompting algorithms are improved through the application of a randomly selected mutation from a uniform distribution. The authors identify five mutation classes: direct mutation, hypermutation, estimation of distribution mutation [20], Lamarckian mutation [24], and prompt crossover/context shuffling. The first two classes further include zero-order and first-order mutations, totaling ten distinct mutations, each implemented through LLM queries. First-order direct mutation modifies candidates using specific mutation prompts, while zero-order mutation utilizes the initial problem statement to address method divergence. When problem specifications lack precision, Lamarckian mutation facilitates prompt reconstruction based on the last output yielding correct results. The algorithm\u2019s key innovation involves hypermutation, which modifies the mutation prompts themselves (via hypermutation prompts), thereby enhancing not only prompt solutions but also the improvement mechanisms. According to the authors, this diversity of operators enables continuous reformulation and representation of problems by LLMs, leading to more effective solutions [6]. This approach demonstrates adaptability across various domains while optimizing prompts and preserving their interpretability. 2 ReflectivePrompt 2.1 Reflective Evolution Reflective evolution is an approach described in the article ReEvo: Large Language Models as Hyper-Heuristics with Reflective Evolution [36]. Its essence lies in using a language model to generate prompts aimed at enhancing the efficiency of mutation and crossover operations. The processes of prompt creation are referred to as short-term and long-term reflection. According to the authors, such reflective actions can be interpreted as obtaining a \"verbal gradient\" within the prompt space. Short-term reflection involves generating crossover prompts based solely on the current parent population, while long-term reflection, as the name suggests, entails accumulating knowledge, dependencies, and methods for improving efficiency throughout the entire evolutionary operation. The application of reflection helps guide the direction of mutation and crossover operations while also expanding the search space, potentially moving beyond the initial population\u2019s predefined prompt space. In the original article, this approach was successfully applied to solving problems such as Guided Local Search (GLS) [30], Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) [3], Electronic Design Automation (EDA) [27], the Decap Placement Problem (DPP) [12], the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) [7], and other combinatorial optimization tasks. 2.2 Proposed solution In this study we developed a novel approach that combines methods of reflective evolution with large language models for the automatic generation of higher-quality prompts \u2014 ReflectivePrompt. ReflectivePrompt employs short-term and long-term reflection operations for subsequent use in crossover and elitist mutation. All performed operations and their corresponding queries to the language model were modified and refined to directly optimize prompts. Specifically, the beginning of each instruction was changed to: \"You are an expert in the domain of optimization prompts. Your task is to give hints to design better prompts.\" This adjustment is motivated by the specifics",
    "corresponding queries to the language model were modified and refined to directly optimize prompts. Specifically, the beginning of each instruction was changed to: \"You are an expert in the domain of optimization prompts. Your task is to give hints to design better prompts.\" This adjustment is motivated by the specifics of the autoprompting task, for which reflective evolution was applied. Techniques describing possible modification operations performed during crossover and mutation, previously used in the SPELL algorithm, were incorporated. Thus, the following was added to the model queries defining short-term and long-term reflection: \"For example, you can try to recommend word replacements, active/positive voice conversions, adding words, or deleting words.\" This enables the LLM to generate more precise, well-described hints that affect not only the semantic content of prompts but also their structural aspects. ReflectivePrompt simplifies user interaction by generating an initial population of prompts based on just a single input prompt. In this approach, the prompt is rephrased using the LLM and structured output techniques [17]. A key feature of ReflectivePrompt is delegating the decision on the specifics of mutation to the model itself. In previously described solutions, the mutation type was either predefined and fixed or randomly selected from a uniform distribution. In this approach, however, the model generates hints autonomously and tends to decide whether to apply structural transformations to the prompt or only modify its semantic meaning and phrasing. When performing crossover and mutation operations, the LLM is provided with a brief task description, which helps generate more problem-targeted prompts while preserving the logical structure of the instruction. Empirical observations have shown that even large models can achieve decent metric values using prompts that are partially or entirely irrelevant to the task. As a result, the final prompts may deviate significantly from the intended meaning. ReflectivePrompt avoids this issue and, in the vast majority of cases, generates semantically correct prompts that are more comprehensible to human perception and logic. The general scheme of reflective evolution within ReflectivePrompt is illustrated in Figure 1. 3 ReflectivePrompt: Reflective evolution in autoprompting algorithms Figure 1: The Reflective Evolution pipeline in ReflectivePrompt Particular attention should be paid to the two selection operations. The parent population selection of prompts chooses pairs of parent prompts from the current population. In this process, each prompt can be included in multiple parent pairs. The main constraint, which is related to the original reflective evolution algorithm, is that prompts in a parent pair must have different fitness function values. Parent selection is performed using the roulette-wheel method [16]. The probability vector for being selected for each individual is represented by the normalized vector of their fitness scores. The second selection operation, which mimics the survival of the",
    "that prompts in a parent pair must have different fitness function values. Parent selection is performed using the roulette-wheel method [16]. The probability vector for being selected for each individual is represented by the normalized vector of their fitness scores. The second selection operation, which mimics the survival of the fittest, also employs the roulette-wheel method, but in this case, the probabilities are obtained by applying a softmax operation with a temperature of 0.1 to the fitness function value vector. This temperature value yields a less uniform distribution in cases where all prompts have approximately similar scores, thereby increasing the probability of selection for individuals with higher fitness values. Another crucial aspect is the preservation of elite individuals in the population. Before the start of each epoch, the individual that has demonstrated the best performance throughout the entire evolutionary process is reintroduced into the population, even if it was not selected at the end of the previous iteration. This approach enhances the algorithm\u2019s convergence speed, as the best individuals are not lost over time due to unfavorable selection outcomes. The examples of ReflectivePrompt optimization are shown in Figures 2 and 3.

As baselines and reference points for comparison, we used results from EvoPrompt, SPELL, PromptBreeder, and Plum. The autoprompting algorithms were executed using large language models from different families and sizes (t-lite-instruct-0.1, gemma3- 27b-it [29]). This choice of LLMs was made due to the use of open source white-box models which are more user-friendly and can be utilized by everyone. Also the significant difference in the number of model parameters leads to better testing coverage and makes our results more unbiased. 5 Initial prompt: \"Identify the position of each object in a fixed order based on the given statements in each input-output pair.\" Optimized prompt: \"Determine the order of three objects based on the given statements.

    "ReflectivePrompt effectively handles both classification and text generation tasks. Across all evaluated datasets, ReflectivePrompt either outperformed or matched the performance of existing evolutionary algorithm-based autoprompting methods. The method showed particularly strong results on the BBH benchmark, comprising 23 classification tasks and 4 text generation tasks. For classification tasks, the average F1-score improved by 6.59% on the t-lite-instruct-0.1 model and by 0.96% on the gemma3-27b-it model. In text generation tasks, the average METEOR score increased by 33.34% on the t-lite-instruct-0.1 model (comparisons and improvements were calculated relative to the maximum average metrics achieved by existing solutions). It should be noted that ReflectivePrompt\u2019s performance significantly depends on the underlying LLM. The effectiveness of reflective evolution relies on the quality of generated hints, and weaker language models may produce suggestions that are not fully relevant to the optimization task. This work creates a scope for future research into reflective evolution for autoprompting applications. The current ReflectivePrompt implementation could potentially be further refined for more targeted prompt optimization. Moreover, the concept of reflective evolution could be generalized and adapted to other metaheuristic optimization algorithms, representing a promising direction for future studies. For example, there was a recent research where reflective prompt evolution outperforms reinforcement learning on a group of benchmarks [1]. 7 METEOR 05 04 03 02 01 0.218 0.214 0.042 0.027 0.017, Bee GSM8K Datasets 0.035 0.028 Methods EvoPrompt @ SPELL PromptBreeder Plum ReflectivePrompt METEOR 05 04 03 02 01 0.143 _ 0.150 0.146 LE a GSM8K Datasets . 0.423 _ 0.425 0.406 . = = Methods 0.423 0.426 SamSUM EvoPrompt SPELL PromptBreeder Plum ReflectivePrompt ReflectivePrompt: Reflective evolution in autoprompting algorithms 5 Conclusion The proposed ReflectivePrompt algorithm, which employs reflective evolution for prompt optimization, was evaluated on 33 datasets covering various natural language processing domains.

    "ConfTuner: Training Large Language Models to Express Their Confidence Verbally Yibo Li National University of Singapore liyibo@u.nus.edu Miao Xiong National University of Singapore miao.xiong@u.nus.edu Jiaying Wu National University of Singapore jiayingwu@u.nus.edu Bryan Hooi \u2217 National University of Singapore bhooi@comp.nus.edu.sg Abstract Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains such as science, law, and healthcare, where accurate expressions of uncertainty are essential for reliability and trust. However, current LLMs are often observed to generate incorrect answers with high confidence\u2014a phenomenon known as \u201coverconfidence\u201d. Recent efforts have focused on calibrating LLMs\u2019 verbalized confidence: i.e., their expressions of confidence in text form, such as \u201cI am 80% con- fident that...\u201d. Existing approaches either rely on prompt engineering or fine-tuning with heuristically generated uncertainty estimates, both of which have limited effec- tiveness and generalizability. Motivated by the notion of proper scoring rules for calibration in classical machine learning models, we introduce ConfTuner, a simple and efficient fine-tuning method that introduces minimal overhead and does not require ground-truth confidence scores or proxy confidence estimates. ConfTuner relies on a new loss function, tokenized Brier score, which we theoretically prove to be a proper scoring rule, intuitively meaning that it \u201ccorrectly incentivizes the model to report its true probability of being correct\u201d. ConfTuner improves calibration across diverse reasoning tasks and generalizes to black-box models such as GPT-4o. Our results further show that better-calibrated confidence enables downstream gains in self-correction and model cascade, advancing the development of trustworthy LLM systems. The code is available at https://github.com/liushiliushi/ConfTuner. 1 Introduction A large language model\u2019s (LLM) ability to recognize and communicate uncertainty through verbalized confidence\u2013that is, expressions of confidence conveyed in natural language, such as \u201cI am 80 percent confident that...\u201d [22]\u2013is central to effective human\u2013AI collaboration [20]. This capability is particularly important in high-stakes domains such as scientific inquiry [1], law [19], and healthcare [21], where decision quality and interpretability are essential. However, current LLMs are not explicitly trained to express calibrated uncertainty. As a result, they often report very high confidence even when producing hallucinated or incorrect content [14, 28, 13, 32]. This overconfidence problem undermines trust and poses serious challenges for the safe deployment of LLMs (Figure 1). Recent efforts [30, 32, 22, 33, 29] have focused on improving the elicitation of verbalized confidence from LLMs. Prompt-based methods rely on carefully crafted instructions [30, 32], but have shown limited effects in improving calibration [30, 32].

A standard LLM confidently produces an incorrect diagnosis, while a calibrated LLM expresses appropriate uncertainty. Thus, the doctor will prescribe a safer, more reliable action. LLMs on synthetic datasets annotated with uncertainty estimates. Due to the lack of ground truth confidence scores, current methods typically rely on heuristically generated proxy scores as targets, such as the model\u2019s average accuracy over a group of similar questions [22], consistency across multiple responses [33], or model judgment [29]. However, using group-level statistics as a proxy for single-instance confidence relies on the strong assumption that the questions within each group are equivalent, sampling-based methods increase both computational costs and random noise, and model judgment introduces model bias. Consequently, there remains a need for more principled and efficient approaches that more directly align an LLM\u2019s verbalized confidence with the actual reliability of its responses. Motivated by this gap, we pose the central research question: Can LLMs be naturally calibrated during training without relying on ground-truth confidence scores or proxy confidence esti- mates? Our approach is inspired by the fact that classical machine learning classifiers naturally become well-calibrated during training when optimized with loss functions that are proper scoring rules [3, 8], such as the Brier score [5], which theoretically encourage the model to make probability estimates that reflect the true likelihood of correctness. Building on this insight, we introduce the no- tion of proper scoring rules for verbalized confidence, which formalizes the notion of a loss function that encourages LLMs to generate tokens that verbally express the true likelihood of correctness. We propose ConfTuner, a simple and efficient fine-tuning method that optimizes a custom-designed loss function, the tokenized Brier score. We show that this loss function has the key property of being a proper scoring rule for verbalized confidence, thus correctly incentivizing the LLM\u2019s confidence expressions. In theory, fine-tuning using this loss naturally leads to accurate verbalized confidence, while requiring minimal overhead to existing fine-tuning pipelines, without relying on ground-truth confidence scores, proxy confidence estimates, or repeated sampling. ConfTuner provides more accurate confidence scores than the best baseline (up to 54.7% improvement in ECE and 14.4% in AUROC), and generalizes better across unseen datasets with diverse reasoning tasks, different formats of confidence expression, and even implicit confidence expressions. We also assess",

ConfTuner provides more accurate confidence scores than the best baseline (up to 54.7% improvement in ECE and 14.4% in AUROC), and generalizes better across unseen datasets with diverse reasoning tasks, different formats of confidence expression, and even implicit confidence expressions. We also assess its effectiveness in calibrating the outputs of black-box models such as GPT-4o [26]. ConfTuner\u2019s strong empirical performance suggests a meaningful alignment between its verbalized confidence and the underlying uncertainty. Beyond standard calibration metrics, we explore its broader utility in enhancing the trustworthiness of LLM-based systems. In particular, we show that well-calibrated confidence enables practical benefits, including improved LLM self-correction and better model cascade. These findings indicate that accurate confidence estimation not only enhances model interpretability and downstream performance, but also holds strong promise for advancing reliable and collaborative human\u2013AI interaction. 2 Background: Calibration in Classification Settings A key motivation behind our work is the intuition that binary classifiers trained using Brier score naturally become calibrated during training, without needing any extra supervision about their confidence [3, 8]. For example, when a binary classifier outputs a probability of 0.8, we often interpret this as predicting with 80% confidence that the true label is 1. We can do this because the classifier is trained using losses that are proper scoring rules [3], such as Brier score. Intuitively, this means that such losses incentivize the classifier to output probabilities that reflect the model\u2019s true likelihood of correctness. Next, we more formally define the notion of proper scoring rules. Proper Scoring Rules. Let X represent an input sample, and Y \u2208[0, 1] indicate whether the model\u2019s prediction is correct. The conditional correctness probability is the true probability that Y = 1 given 2 Confidence levels (0-100) LLM Please provide your Answer : Yes Confidence : ... 99 ... ... ... 0 1 100 99 2 3 4 98 97 96 ... ... ... 100 99 98 97 96 Fine-tune based on tokenized Brier score ...

In the first stage, we compute the model\u2019s probability distribution over the confidence levels of 0-100. In the second stage, we use the tokenized Brier score to calibrate the probability distribution, converting misaligned confidence 99% to 5%. X, defined as: \u03b7(X) := Pr \u0000Y = 1 | X \u0001 .

    "levels of 0-100. In the second stage, we use the tokenized Brier score to calibrate the probability distribution, converting misaligned confidence 99% to 5%. X, defined as: \u03b7(X) := Pr \u0000Y = 1 | X \u0001 . A scoring rule \u2113(p, y) : [0, 1] \u00d7 {0, 1} \u2192R\u22650 is called proper if its expected loss (i.e., risk) RX(p) := E[ \u2113(p, Y ) | X ] is minimized when the prediction probability p matches the true correctness probability p = \u03b7(X) almost surely. In theory, a proper scoring rule encourages the model to make probability estimates that reflect the true likelihood of correctness [3]. In particular, the Brier score \u2113B(p, y) = (y \u2212p)2 has been proven to be a proper scoring rule [3]. 3 ConfTuner: Verbalized Calibration in Language Models From Classifiers to Language Models. Since LLMs are not explicitly trained to verbalize their confidence, our goal is to enable LLMs to verbalize their confidence in a way that faithfully reflects their true likelihood of correctness. A typical use case, which we focus on for most of this paper, is where an LLM is given a question and is asked to provide both its answer and a verbalized expression of its confidence (such as a percentage). Traditional classifiers are generally fitted using proper scoring rules, providing an important theoretical guarantee that the classifiers are correctly incentivized to output numeric confidence p that matches the true conditional probability \u03b7(X). However, we cannot directly apply the theory of proper scoring rules to verbalized calibration - the key difference is that in this case, instead of outputting a numeric confidence p, the model outputs a token sequence such as \u201cConfidence: 80%\u201d, and our goal is for the meaning of these tokens to accurately match the model\u2019s true probability of correctness. To fill this gap, ConfTuner fine-tunes the model using a new loss function, the tokenized Brier score. This score is designed to incentivize the language model to generate the confidence token that is as close as possible to the true probability of correctness. For example, if the true conditional probability of a model\u2019s answer being correct is 0.667, the LLM should output the confidence token representing 67%. We will formalize this by defining the notion of a proper scoring rule for verbalized calibration, which is a loss function that correctly incentivizes the LLM to generate the closest possible token to the true likelihood of correctness. Then, we will show that our score satisfies this condition. ConfTuner Overview. Our proposed algorithm, ConfTuner, consists of two key steps (see Figure 2): 1. Compute Probability Distribution Over Confidence Tokens: Given a prompt that asks the LLM to output the answer and its confidence for",
    "true likelihood of correctness. Then, we will show that our score satisfies this condition. ConfTuner Overview. Our proposed algorithm, ConfTuner, consists of two key steps (see Figure 2): 1. Compute Probability Distribution Over Confidence Tokens: Given a prompt that asks the LLM to output the answer and its confidence for a question, this step extracts the model\u2019s probability distribution over a predefined set of confidence tokens. 3 2. Fine-Tune Based on Tokenized Brier Score: The probability distribution is used to compute a tokenized Brier score against the ground truth correctness of the generated answer, effectively penalizing miscalibrated confidence. We fine-tune the LLM based on the tokenized Brier score. 3.1 Compute Probability Distribution over Confidence Tokens Our ultimate goal is to ensure that the confidence tokens generated by the LLM align with the true correctness of its prediction. Concretely, given an input question x, we use a prompt that asks the LLM to output its answer, followed by expressing its confidence like \u201cConfidence: 80%\u201d. This token sequence consists of a fixed prefix (\u201cConfidence: \u201d), followed by a token from a predefined set of confidence tokens TN := {0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N}. For simplicity, we assume that these tokens correspond to the uniformly spaced probabilities of 0, 1/N, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 1 respectively. In the above example, we ask the model to express its confidence as a percentage, so our token set is T100 = {0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 100}. Another natural choice would be to express confidence using a smaller number of confidence levels, such as T9 = {0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 9}. Our overall approach is not specific to any choice of N, but in practice we focus on T100 and T9, as we consider these levels to be well-aligned with confidence expressions used in human communication, and are sufficiently fine-grained while being easy to interpret. Our goal is to encourage the model to assign the highest probability to the confidence level that best matches the actual correctness of its generated answer. The first step toward this goal is to compute the model\u2019s probability distribution over confidence tokens. We first instruct the LLM to generate its confidence score over TN: e.g., for T100, we ask it for a percentage c%, where c \u2208{0, 1, . . . , 100}. When generating the token representing c, the model outputs a full logit vector f \u2208R|V| before the softmax layer. The logit vector f assigns a prediction score (logit) to each token in the vocabulary. We then extract the logits for tokens in TN, denoted as f0, f1, . . . , fN. We then compute the softmax of these selected logits: qi =",
    "f \u2208R|V| before the softmax layer. The logit vector f assigns a prediction score (logit) to each token in the vocabulary. We then extract the logits for tokens in TN, denoted as f0, f1, . . . , fN. We then compute the softmax of these selected logits: qi = exp(fi) PN j=0 exp(fj), where qi represents the model\u2019s probability to generate the confidence token i. This results in the probability vector q that we are interested in: q = (q0, . . . , qN) \u2208\u2206N+1, \u2206N+1 := n q \u2208RN+1 \u22650 : N X i=0 qi = 1 o . 3.2 Fine-Tune Based on Tokenized Brier Score We want to design a loss function applicable to LLMs that ensures that the loss-minimizing classifier is well-calibrated. To do so, we adapt the classical Brier score [5] to the tokenized setting: for a prediction vector q and correctness indicator y, define the tokenized Brier score: \u2113(q, y) := N X i=0 qi \u0000y \u2212i N \u00012. (1) Here (y \u2212i/N)2 is the squared error for the current sample that would be incurred if the model were to predict i as its confidence token. Since the model has a qi probability to generate confidence token i, this summation computes the model\u2019s error in expectation over its predictive distribution. The Brier loss penalizes both overconfident and underconfident predictions. For example, as shown in Figure 2, the answer is incorrect (y = 0); thus, in Equation (1), the term (y \u2212i/N)2 becomes (0 \u2212i/N)2. This term is minimized (equals 0) when i = 0 and maximized (equals 1) when i = N. Therefore, to minimize \u2113(q, y), the model is incentivized to assign a high probability to the logit q0 representing 0 confidence and low probabilities to the logit qN representing N. Similarly, for other confidence levels, the model will also encourage high probability for low confidence levels and low probability for high confidence levels. Conversely, if the answer is correct (y = 1), the term becomes (1 \u2212i/N)2, which is minimized (equals 0) for i = N and maximized (equals 1) for i = 0. The tokenized Brier score guides the fine-tuning process, iteratively adjusting the model\u2019s parameters to produce better-calibrated confidence assessments alongside answers. 3.3 Proper Scoring Rules for Verbalized Calibration In this section, we define the notion of a proper scoring rule for verbalized calibration, which is a loss function that correctly incentivizes the LLM to generate the closest possible token to the true likelihood of correctness. Then, we will show that the tokenized Brier score satisfies this condition. 4 Let X be a random variable representing the input question, and Y be an indicator random variable Y \u2208{0, 1}",
    "that correctly incentivizes the LLM to generate the closest possible token to the true likelihood of correctness. Then, we will show that the tokenized Brier score satisfies this condition. 4 Let X be a random variable representing the input question, and Y be an indicator random variable Y \u2208{0, 1} for whether the LLM answers the question correctly (1) or incorrectly (0). We consider i.i.d. training examples (x, y) drawn from an unknown distribution D with density p(x, y) = p(y | x)p(x). Like before, for a fixed input x, the conditional probability that the model is correct is: \u03b7(x) := Pr \u0000Y = 1 | X = x \u0001 \u2208[0, 1]. In what follows we fix a single input x and denote \u03b7 = \u03b7(x) for brevity. Definition 1 (Proper Scoring Rule for Verbalized Confidence). Fix an input x with Bayesian correct- ness probability \u03b7 = Pr(Y = 1 | X = x). Consider the conditional risk Rx(q) := E[ \u2113(q, Y ) | X = x ], q \u2208\u2206N+1, (2) Let k := arg min i\u2208{0,...,N} \u03b7 \u2212i N , The loss \u2113(q, y) is a proper scoring rule for verbalized confidence if its risk is minimized when the LLM\u2019s output probability distribution, q, is a deterministic distribution putting all its mass on the token k: i.e., qk = 1 and qj = 0 for all j \u0338= k. Theorem 1 (Tokenized Brier Score correctly incentivizes verbalized confidence). The tokenized Brier score \u2113(q, y), as defined in (1), is a proper scoring rule for verbalized confidence. The proof can be found in Appendix B. Theorem 1 indicates that the tokenized Brier score is a proper scoring rule, i.e., an LLM fine-tuned on this score will place all its probability mass on the token whose confidence value is closest to the true conditional correctness probability. 4 Experiments In this section, we first provide the experimental setup, then investigate whether ConfTuner learns effective verbalized confidence estimation and how this capability enables more trustworthy LLM systems. Finally, we compare the training/inference time and training data size, demonstrating the efficiency of ConfTuner. 4.1 Experimental Setup Datasets. Following [33], we use HotpotQA [35] for training, which typically requires multi-step reasoning to derive the answer. For evaluation, besides the evaluation set of HotpotQA, we also adopt: 1) TriviaQA [15], which includes open-domain trivia questions and source documents; following [29], we sample 1,000 for evaluation. 2) StrategyQA [9], where the required reasoning steps are implicit in the question, and should be inferred strategically. 3) GSM8K [6], a benchmark comprising linguistically diverse and high-quality mathematics questions designed for grade school students. Here we sample 1,000 for evaluation. 4) TruthfulQA [23], which evaluates how models balance factual",

Here we sample 1,000 for evaluation. 4) TruthfulQA [23], which evaluates how models balance factual accuracy against response utility, using questions that commonly mislead humans. Baselines. We evaluate ConfTuner on top of three base LLMs: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct [10], Qwen2.5- 7B-Instruct [34], Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410 [24] (An enhanced variant of Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3). For brevity, we refer to these models as LLaMA, Qwen, and Ministral, respectively, throughout the paper. We compare ConfTuner against the following baselines: 1) Base: The original, unmodified LLM. 2) Ensemble: The LLM is prompted three times to generate top-k answers with confidence, and the verbalized confidence scores are averaged to produce the final confidence estimate. 3) Two training-based methods: SaySelf [33] and LACIE [29]. For LACIE, we constructed training datasets following their original implementations. For SaySelf, we directly use their training dataset (constructed based on HotpotQA). We ensure fair comparison by: i) using the same inference-time prompting strategy, and ii) re-training SaySelf and LACIE using the same base LLMs on HotpotQA. For inference, we use greedy decoding for all the methods, except for Ensemble, which requires sampling multiple responses. Evaluation Metrics. To assess the quality of confidence estimates, we employ two metrics following previous works [32, 18, 33, 29]: Expected Calibration Error (ECE) [25] and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUROC) [4]. ECE measures the gap between a model\u2019s predicted confidence and its empirical 5 Table 1: ECE scores (\u2193) of all the methods. ConfTuner achieves notably lower ECE scores across all three base models, for both the in-distribution dataset and out-of-distribution datasets.

To investigate whether ConfTuner shows good performance for verbalized confidence estimation, we conduct experiments to assess its generalization across novel datasets, different forms of confidence representation, and its adaptation to black-box models. Generalization to Unseen Datasets. To assess ConfTuner\u2019s generalization, we evaluate its perfor- mance on the in-distribution dataset HotpotQA [35] and four out-of-distribution datasets: GSM8K [6], TriviaQA [15], StrategyQA [9], and TruthfulQA [23]. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, ConfTuner consistently achieves higher AUROC and lower ECE values across all three base models, indicating its robust generalization. Overall, training-based methods, SaySelf and LACIE, outperform the prompt-based method, Ensemble. This is primarily because even though Ensemble utilizes multiple sampling strategies, the model inherently lacks the capacity to provide reliable confidence estimates. We also illustrate ConfTuner\u2019s accuracy among different confidence levels in Figure 3, where Conf- Tuner shows minimal accuracy-confidence gaps (red bars). Accuracy results and comparison to the logit-based method can be found in Appendix F. Generalization to Different Format of Confidence Scores. We further investigate whether Conf- Tuner learns format-agnostic confidence estimation. We train ConfTuner on numerical confidence (0%-100%) and test it on linguistic confidence expressions (high/medium/low) across five datasets. Because the exact confidence probabilities corresponding to high, medium, and low are undefined, we focus only on AUROC, which only evaluates whether the model assigns higher confidence to correct predictions than incorrect ones. The results in Table 3 report AUROC scores on ConfTuner and baselines (excluding Ensemble, which cannot produce linguistic confidence). ConfTuner consistently achieves superior AUROC scores, indicating that ConfTuner can also adapt to other formats of confidence levels, highlighting its potential for practical applications, where intuitive confidence communication is critical. Compared to directly utilizing numerical confidence, the slight drop in AUROC might be attributed to the inherently coarse-grained nature of linguistic confidence. Accuracy comparison can be found in Appendix F. Generalization to Implicit Confidence Expressions. We conduct experiments to investigate whether ConfTuner could also provide implicit confidence expressions. In the inference stage, instead of 6 Table 2: AUROC scores (\u2191) of all the methods.

The results of AUROC and ECE are shown in Table 4, demonstrating that implicit confidence calibration of ConfTuner is comparable to explicit confidence calibration. Calibration for Other Models. ConfTuner also offers a solution to calibrate confidence for answers of black-box models (e.g., GPT-4o), which is hard to train. We train ConfTuner (based on LLaMA) to provide confidence levels for GPT-4o\u2019s responses. As shown in Table 5, ConfTuner achieves higher AUROC and lower ECE scores, indicating improved calibration. This proxy calibration has the potential to effectively assess and mitigate overconfidence risks in black-box systems.

    "LLM systems, we examine the practical benefits of calibrated confidence. We specifically investigate whether ConfTuner enables better self-correction ability, and whether ConfTuner enables better reliability-cost balance. ConfTuner Improves the Self-correction Ability of LLM. Self-correction offers a straightforward method to enhance LLM reliability by directly instructing the model to refine its answers [7]. We conduct self-correction experiments on HotpotQA and TruthfulQA, where LLMs demonstrate high error rates and low confidence. Specifically, we first instruct LLM to generate answers and confidences, then retain initial responses with high confident (larger than 0.5) answers, and instruct LLM to refine low-confident (smaller than 0.5) answers. As presented in Figure 4, ConfTuner (based on Qwen) achieves larger improvements on both datasets. In contrast, baselines show marginal gains or even degradation. This is because baselines are more likely to provide low confidence for correct answers, misleading LLMs to modify correct responses into incorrect ones. The detailed accuracy results can be found in Appendix F. ConfTuner Achieves Higher Performance Gain at Same Cost in Confidence-Based Model Cascade Systems. One important application of accurate confidence estimation is in confidence- based model cascades, where a base model\u2019s low-confidence outputs trigger selective intervention by a stronger model to improve reliability while keeping the overall cost low. We evaluate whether the confidence estimates produced by ConfTuner can better support this process. Specifically, we compare LLaMA and its fine-tuned version, ConfTuner, by using their confidence scores to select 100 to 400 low-confidence samples for further refinement by GPT-4o [26]. As shown in Figure 5, ConfTuner consistently achieves higher refined accuracy, with improvements of up to 9.3% on HotpotQA and 8 Table 5: AUROC (\u2191) and ECE (\u2193) of GPT-4o and ConfTuner.

Prior works [18, 16, 2] have explored calibrating confidence scores based on the logits of LLM-generated answers, but these logits are often inaccessible to users, hindering practical use. To address this, recent studies [32, 30, 29, 33, 22] have focused on eliciting verbalized confidence directly from LLM outputs. Initial approaches [32, 30] leveraged prompt strategies to guide LLMs to directly output confidence levels. While flexible, these methods often yield poorly calibrated verbalized confidence. Recent efforts [22] have shifted toward 9 Accuracy Change Rate (%) Base HotpotQA LACIE SaySelf ConfTuner Accuracy Change Rate (%) Base TruthftulQA LACIE SaySelf ConfTuner 06 HotpotQA TruthfulQA \u2014@\u2014 Base +9. 3% \u2014\u2122\u2014 ConfTuner | +7.5% +5.9% +5 5% \u00a9 oO oO iN Accuracy + IS (oY) xe 0.3 100 200 300 400 100 200 300 400 Modified Samples Modified Samples fine-tuning LLMs to produce verbalized confidence scores, typically by training models to map entire question categories to predefined confidence values. However, this category-level calibration assumes the same uncertainty scores across all questions within a class, an unrealistic premise that ignores question-level variations in difficulty or ambiguity. To overcome this, SaySelf [33] proposes question-level calibration, where confidence is estimated for individual questions. Yet, it often requires sampling multiple responses per question to infer confidence levels, which is suboptimal and incurs significant computational costs. LACIE [29] utilizes a preference dataset where responses are labeled for confidence levels. Its training objective is to encourage models to produce correct and confident or incorrect and unconfident responses. However, a key limitation of this approach is its reliance",
    "confidence levels, which is suboptimal and incurs significant computational costs. LACIE [29] utilizes a preference dataset where responses are labeled for confidence levels. Its training objective is to encourage models to produce correct and confident or incorrect and unconfident responses. However, a key limitation of this approach is its reliance on model judgment for the initial confident/unconfident labeling, which is not accurate. More related work for traditional calibration methods can be found in Appendix A 6 Conclusion and Future Work In this work, we focus on the critical challenge of LLM overconfidence, which is especially important in high-risk applications. We address this issue by calibrating the verbalized confidence of LLMs. We propose a tokenized Brier score to fine-tune the LLM on the probability distribution of different confidence levels, and theoretically prove that this score is a proper scoring rule, ensuring that it correctly incentivizes the verbalized confidence during training. We further propose our ConfTuner framework to fine-tune the LLM. Experimental results demonstrate that ConfTuner has learned effective verbalized confidence estimation, and this ability can enable more trustworthy LLM systems. Limitations and Future Work. Looking ahead, several considerations remain in fully realizing the potential of ConfTuner: 1) Generalization to Complex Contexts. Though experiments demonstrate that ConfTuner trained with a fixed set of confidence tokens generalizes to alternative expressions, it remains an open question as to how far we can extend it toward more complex conversational contexts and more diverse confidence expressions. However, ConfTuner represents a meaningful initial step toward integrating uncertainty awareness into LLMs through the proper scoring rule, offering advantages over heuristic methods. In the future, we plan to extend ConfTuner to more flexible and context-aware uncertainty expressions. 2) Practical Calibration Challenges. While proper scoring rules provide a principled objective for calibration, achieving well-calibrated models in practice often depends on many other factors, including data quality, model architecture, and optimization dynamics [11], which we plan to analyze in order to better align theoretical guarantees with real-world performance. 10 References [1] Akari Asai, Jacqueline He*, Rulin Shao*, Weijia Shi, Amanpreet Singh, Joseph Chee Chang, Kyle Lo, Luca Soldaini, Sergey Feldman, Tian, D\u2019arcy Mike, David Wadden, Matt Latzke, Minyang, Pan Ji, Shengyan Liu, Hao Tong, Bohao Wu, Yanyu Xiong, Luke Zettlemoyer, Dan Weld, Graham Neubig, Doug Downey, Wen-tau Yih, Pang Wei Koh, and Hannaneh Hajishirzi.

    "July 2020, Virtual Event, volume 119 of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, pages 11117\u201311128. PMLR, 2020. 13 A Related Works Traditional Confidence Calibration. Traditional confidence calibration methods largely fall into two categories: scaling-based and binning-based methods. Scaling-based techniques, such as temperature scaling [11], modify predicted probabilities by applying a learned scalar to all samples, while more advanced variations like parameterized temperature scaling [31] introduce input-dependent adjustments for greater expressiveness, and Mix-n-Match [38] employs ensemble and composition strategies for data-efficient and accuracy-preserving estimates. On the other hand, binning-based methods, including classic histogram binning [36], mutual-information-maximization- based binning [27], and isotonic regression [37], group samples into multiple bins according to their confidence scores and then calibrate each bin individually. Despite these varied approaches, existing calibration methods cannot be directly used for verbalized confidence calibration. B Proof of Theorem 1 Proof. Conditioned on the fixed x, the quantity pi is deterministic while Y \u223cBernoulli(\u03b7). Using linearity of expectation and Y 2 = Y for binary labels, E[(Y \u2212pi)2 | X = x] = E[Y 2 \u22122Y pi + p2 i | X = x] = \u03b7(1 \u2212pi)2 + (1 \u2212\u03b7)p2 i . For compactness, we set fi(\u03b7) := \u03b7(1 \u2212pi)2 + (1 \u2212\u03b7)p2 i , (3) so that Eq. (2) becomes Rx(q) = P100 i=0 qi fi(\u03b7). Observe that Rx(q) is a linear function of q. Because the feasible set \u2206101 is the convex hull of its vertices (the standard basis vectors), the minimum of a linear function over \u2206101 is always attained at a vertex. Hence it suffices to look for a deterministic solution, which places probability 1 on a single index and 0 on all others. It remains to identify the best index. Extend the grid {0, 1/N, . . . , 1} to the closed interval [0, 1] and define for a continuous variable p \u2208[0, 1] g(p) := \u03b7(1 \u2212p)2 + (1 \u2212\u03b7)p2 = \u03b7 \u22122\u03b7p + p2. This is a convex quadratic. Differentiating, we obtain g\u2032(p) = 2(p \u2212\u03b7), which vanishes only at p = \u03b7. Because the second derivative g\u2032\u2032(p) = 2 > 0, this point is the global minimizer of g. Since the quadratic is strictly convex and symmetric about its minimum point \u03b7, on the discrete grid the minimum is achieved by whichever grid point is closest to \u03b7. Formally, min i\u2208{0,...,100} fi(\u03b7) = fk(\u03b7), where k is chosen as in the statement. Combining these two observations, (i) that the risk minimizer must be deterministic, and (ii) that among deterministic predictions the chosen index must be k, establishes the claim. C Prompts We provide the prompts for all the tasks in our experiments in Table 7 and Table 8. D Reproducibility Information D.1 Evaluation Environments",

Here we set B to 10. AUROC evaluates the model\u2019s ability to separate correct from incorrect predictions through confidence scores by examining whether correct predictions systematically receive higher confidence values than errors. AUROC can be calculated as:AUROC = R 1 0 TPR(t) dFPR(t), where true positive rate TPR(t) and false positive rate FPR(t) are functions of the threshold t of confidence scores.

Answer correctness is assessed as follows: for HotpotQA and TruthfulQA, we use GPT-4o [26] to judge the correctness. For other datasets, the model is instructed to extract the final answer, which is further compared to the ground truth.

    "other datasets, the model is instructed to extract the final answer, which is further compared to the ground truth. For ConfTuner and training-based baselines, the inference temperature was set to 0. For prompt-based baselines requiring non-deterministic generation, we used the temperature specified in [32]. For LLaMA, we additionally add a regularization term and discuss the effect of it in Appendix E. We train LLaMA with T100 and train Qwen and Ministral with T9. D.5 Optimal Parameters For LLaMA, the optimal configuration was determined to be a learning rate of 1e-5, 2 training epochs, and a batch size of 16. The Ministral achieved peak performance with a slightly higher learning rate of 3e-5, 2 epochs, and the same batch size of 16. Meanwhile, the Qwen model required an extended training regimen of 3 epochs and a larger batch size of 24, paired with a learning rate of 1e-5. E Ablation Study Regularization Term. We additionally introduce a regularization term to encourage low divergence between the prediction of the fine-tuned model and the base model. This term is exactly the same as the supervised fine-tuning loss Lsft = \u2212PT t=1 log P(yt|y<t, X; \u03b8), where X is the input of LLM, yt is the true token occur at time t, \u03b8 is the parameter of the LLM. We do an ablation study to show the influence of the regularization term. As shown in Table 9, the performance of LLaMA w/o con is worse than that of LLaMA w/ con. This is primarily because, after training, LLaMA w/ con sometimes omits confidence scores or generates repetitive text. Conversely, Qwen and Ministral-based model demonstrated robust performance even without this regularization. Training Data Size. To investigate the impact of training data size on model performance, we train ConfTuner (based on LLaMA) using datasets ranging from 500 to 10,000 samples. We evaluate ConfTuner\u2019s average AUROC and ECE across five distinct datasets. As illustrated in Figure 6, ConfTuner achieves good performance with as few as 2,000 training samples. This result highlights that ConfTuner develops robust calibration capabilities even from limited data. Impact of Confidence Forms During Training. To assess the impact of confidence representation during training, we compare two approaches for LLaMA: using a continuous 0%-100% confidence 17 Table 9: ECE and AUROC metrics for dif- ferent base models with (w/ reg) and without regularization (w/o reg).

The results, presented in Table 10, demonstrate that the 0%-100% scale lead to a marginal improvement in performance. E.1 Ablation on Training Distribution Shifts We further train LLaMA on GSM8K (math problems) instead of HotpotQA (general knowledge from Wikipedia). As shown in Table 11. ConfTuner trained on GSM8K performs better on GSM8K and StrategyQA, but worse on HotpotQA, TriviaQA, and TruthfulQA. Table 11: ECE and AUROC metrics for ConfTuner trained on GSM8K and HotpotQA.

The results of AUROC and ECE are presented in Table 12. Our findings indicate that outputting confidence before the answer yields poorer performance compared to outputting it afterward, suggesting that the hidden states of the answer tokens are informative about the certainty of the response. And ConfTuner still outperforms Base model when outputting confidence first. F.2 Comparison between ConfTuner and a classifier We do a precise comparison between (A) ConfTuner, and (B) an LLM with an external linear classifier with the same architecture as the model\u2019s original output projection layer. Specifically, this confidence classifier is a linear transformation layer, whose input dimension matches the dimension of the model\u2019s hidden states, and its output dimension equals the size of the model\u2019s vocabulary.

(A) and (B) have the exact same architecture, and the only differences between them are (1) End- to-end training: in (A), we train the LLM end to end, but in (B) we train only the final linear laye. (2) Initialization / parameter sharing: in (A), the output projection layer parameters are tied with the LLM\u2019s original embedding matrix, while in (B), the classifier\u2019s parameters are not tied and randomly initialized. To further disentangle these effects, we also evaluated a third variant: (C) a classifier identical to (B), but initialized with the LLM\u2019s original embedding matrix. As shown in Table 13 we have the following observations: (1) the classifier initialized with LLM\u2019s original embedding matrix (C) performs better than the classifier with random initialization (B). This indicates that the random initialization might lead to noise (or noisy gradients), resulting in sub-optimal results. (2) ConfTuner still performs better than the classifier initialized with LLM\u2019s original embedding matrix (C). This is because the classifier infers only based on the hidden state of the LLM. If the final hidden state does not capture sufficient information about the model\u2019s confidence, the classifier will be less effective at confidence estimation. In contrast, ConfTuner trains the LLM itself\u2019s parameters, so the LLM can be trained to preserve the necessary confidence information in the final hidden state.

    "USA, 5 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3746252. xxxxxxx 1 Introduction Mathematical reasoning, a critical capability of large language mod- els (LLMs) for real-world applications, has garnered substantial attention. Recent studies demonstrate that training LLMs on math- ematical data enhances this capacity [3, 15, 16]. However, with conventional mathematical corpora (e.g., web pages and textbooks) becoming progressively depleted, current approaches increasingly rely on either manual annotation [18] or more advanced LLMs to acquire consumable training data [5, 13, 17, 20]. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches face significant challenges in cost and quality, posing non-negligible risks to LLM development: (1) Manual annotation necessitates high-caliber annotators and incurs substantial costs when handling complex problem sets; (2) Existing LLM-synthesized corpora frequently exhibit unreliable correctness, with our random sampling revealing a 40% error rate in existing synthetic datasets. Though such data may temporarily boost model performance, these quality issues undermine the long-term, sus- tainable enhancement of this capability. In this work, we aim to construct a scalable data synthesis pipeline to generate high-quality mathematical data with ensured diversity, complexity, and correctness for training LLMs. Our core approach leverages a systematic mathematical knowledge frame- work and mathematical tools to guarantee data quality through bilateral verification mechanisms. Unlike prior approaches that integrate tools or use program-of-thought paradigms, our frame- work leverages mathematical tools not to enhance models\u2019 tool- invocation capabilities, but to systematically generate natural lan- guage corpora for improving the mathematical reasoning abilities. arXiv:2508.18824v1 [cs.CL] 26 Aug 2025 CIKM \u201925, November 10\u201314, 2025, Seoul, Republic of Korea Chen and Tian, et al. However, synthesizing high-quality mathematical corpora poses multifaceted challenges: (1) Diversity and Systematic Coverage: Traditional methods relying on web corpora or benchmark-driven synthesis often overfit existing data distributions, failing to ensure both systematic coverage and sufficient diversity. (2) Complexity- Correctness Tradeoff: While generating complex mathematical problems is crucial, increased problem complexity inherently ampli- fies unreliability in generated outputs and verification challenges. To address these dilemmas, we propose a novel program-assisted generation approach that leverages executable programs to produce high-quality mathematical data. For systematicity and diversity, we first construct a three-tier mathematical knowledge system (\u201cedu- cation stage, subject, topic\u201d) and associate each knowledge topic with mathematical tools. Through the combinatorial integration of knowledge topics and their corresponding tools, we generate executable programs that comprehensively cover the knowledge system. These programs are then combined with those derived from seed corpora to form a systematic and diverse collection of math programs. To balance complexity and correctness, we employ four mutation strategies (constraint, variable, constant, and code variations) on a mathematical program set, enhancing complex- ity and quantity. The mutated programs are translated back into natural language questions with corresponding solutions. Next, a bilateral validation mechanism ensures synthesis quality: LLM- generated solutions",
    "To balance complexity and correctness, we employ four mutation strategies (constraint, variable, constant, and code variations) on a mathematical program set, enhancing complex- ity and quantity. The mutated programs are translated back into natural language questions with corresponding solutions. Next, a bilateral validation mechanism ensures synthesis quality: LLM- generated solutions are verified against program execution outputs, effectively eliminating errors from the generation pipeline and en- suring program-problem consistency. Using our approach, AMD, we synthesized over 12 million high-quality mathematical data samples. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs with our data significantly enhances their reasoning abilities, often surpassing state-of-the-art methods on various evaluation datasets. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We explore a novel mathematical data synthesis paradigm that leverages exter- nal tools to ensure the complexity and correctness of the synthetic corpus. (2) We construct a comprehensive mathematical knowledge system and a corresponding mathematical toolkit to enable system- atic synthesis of math reasoning data. (3) We develop a scalable syn- thesis approach that simultaneously considers diversity, complexity, and correctness, generating over 12 million high-quality mathe- matical reasoning samples. (4) Extensive experiments demonstrate both the effectiveness of our synthetic data and the superiority of our synthesis approach over conventional approaches. 2 Approach Different from tool-integrated LLM approaches [5, 21], we focus on synthesizing a correctness-guaranteed math corpus to enhance the LLM\u2019s intrinsic mathematical reasoning, rather than its function- calling abilities. As shown in Fig. 1, we first construct a knowledge system that maps mathematical concepts to tools. These tools are integrated into executable programs, forming a diverse program set along with those derived from a seed mathematics corpus. We then mutate these programs to generate more complex variations and translate them into natural language questions. Finally, we solve these questions using LLMs and conduct bilateral verification between the LLM-generated solutions and the program execution results to filter out a correctness-guaranteed corpus. Formally, our goal can be summarized as: Based on a compre- hensive mathematical knowledge system K and seed questions S, we construct a diverse and complex set of math programs C = {\ud835\udc50}. From this, we create a correctness-guaranteed math corpus D = {(\ud835\udc50,\ud835\udc5e,\ud835\udc4e)}, where \ud835\udc50is a synthetic math program, \ud835\udc5eand \ud835\udc4eare the corresponding math question and solution, respectively. 2.1 Knowledge System-driven Mathematical Programs Synthesis. To construct the knowledge system, we integrate two foundational resources: K-12 mathematics textbooks and the mathematical tax- onomy from the Chinese Library Classification System. We then exploit the integration capabilities of GPT-4 as well as the knowl- edge of human experts to develop a comprehensive knowledge system. As a result, our knowledge system K organizes more than 250 key topics in mathematics into a three-tier hierarchy of educa- tion stage, subject and topic (such",
    "We then exploit the integration capabilities of GPT-4 as well as the knowl- edge of human experts to develop a comprehensive knowledge system. As a result, our knowledge system K organizes more than 250 key topics in mathematics into a three-tier hierarchy of educa- tion stage, subject and topic (such as College \u2192Linear Algebra \u2192 Eigenvalues), ensuring curricular alignment and academic rigor. Constructing Systematic Mathematical Toolkit. Building upon the knowledge system K, we create an automated pipeline to map mathematical topics to tools. For each topic \ud835\udc58\u2208K, we select 10-50 representative problems from curricular materials and open-source math corpora. GPT-4 generates programs to solve these problems using scientific computing libraries (e.g., SymPy), ensuring standard API usage and step-by-step derivations. We then extract the related APIs, {\ud835\udc61}\ud835\udc58, from these programs through syntax pattern mining, establishing a mapping from topic \ud835\udc58to tools {\ud835\udc61}\ud835\udc58. Finally, we ag- gregate the related APIs from all knowledge topics to obtain the tool set T = \u00d0 \ud835\udc58\u2208K{\ud835\udc61}\ud835\udc58, where T consists of over 100 APIs. These APIs form a Mathematical Toolkit, organized by Topic (e.g., Matrix Diagonalization) and Atomic Operation (e.g., numpy.linalg.qr), bridging the knowledge system with computational practice. Synthesizing Programs via Tool Combinations. Inspired by \u201cSentence Building Games\u201d, we combine tools from different math topics in K to construct executable programs. Specifically, each generation process begins by sampling 1-3 mathematical topics from our structured knowledge system K through stratified random sampling, forming a topic combination (\ud835\udc581,\ud835\udc582, ...), which maintains curriculum coherence through constraint-based selection. Each topic \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc56is then mapped to its corresponding code tools through our toolkit, generating a tool combination (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc581,\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc582, ...). Finally, the program generator LLM\ud835\udc43uses the topic and tool combinations, along with a prompt, to generate a program as follows: C\ud835\udc3e= \u00d8 (\ud835\udc581,...)\u223cK LLM\ud835\udc43((\ud835\udc581, ...), (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc581, ...), \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5d) where C\ud835\udc3eare programs generated from our knowledge system and \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5dis the program generation prompt. Additionally, to enhance real-world relevance, we sample about 100 thousand problems from standard benchmarks to form a seed question set S. These problems are solved using programs to generate an additional program set: C\ud835\udc46= \u00d8 \ud835\udc5e\u2032\u2208\u02c6S LLM\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc5e\u2032, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5d\u2032), where \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5d\u2032 denotes the program solution generation prompt.By merging the above program sets, the final program set C = C\ud835\udc3e\u222aC\ud835\udc46 Arrows of Math Reasoning Data Synthesis for Large Language Models: Diversity, Complexity and Correctness CIKM \u201925, November 10\u201314, 2025, Seoul, Republic of Korea Question Output Correctness-Guaranteed Mathematical Corpus Synthesis Diverse Math Programs Accurate Math Corpus Answer Question Answer & Verification Question Backtranslation Question Solving Program Execution Program Mutating Driven by LLMs Driven by the Python Compiler Knowledge System-Driven Mathematical Programs Synthesis Math Knowledge System Grade Middle High College Knowledge Point Mix Math Seed Corpus Convert Question to Program Convert Tools Mix to Program",

We first develop a mathematical knowledge system mapping concepts to tools, then synthesize diverse math programs by integrating these tools with a seed corpus. Next, these programs are mutated for increased complexity and translated into natural language questions. Finally, an LLM generates solutions using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, which are then verified against program execution results for correctness. is a diverse collection that fulfills two key objectives: 1) systematic coverage through knowledge graph traversal, 2) empirical ground- ing via real-world problem distribution matching. 2.2 Program-driven Mathematical Corpus Synthesis. Instead of augmenting data directly, we first enhance program complexity through mutation and then translate these programs into new question-solution pairs. The correctness of these pairs is then ensured through bilateral validation, comparing program execution results against the LLM-generated solutions. Mutating Programs for Greater Complexity. Our synthesized program set C combines two generation sources (the knowledge system and seed questions) to ensure both systematic coverage and diversity. However, empirical result reveals inherent limitations in direct LLM-generated programs C = {\ud835\udc50}, which often suffer from oversimplification and insufficient quantity. To overcome these limitations, we develop a mutation strategy with four specialized operators: 1) Constraint Mutation: deepens problem complexity by adding/modifying constraints (e.g., \u201c0 < \ud835\udc65\u201d \u2192\u201c0 < \ud835\udc65< 5\u201d). 2) Variable Mutation: introduces new variables or substitutes existing ones (e.g., linear \u2192multivariate equations). 3) Constant Mutation: perturbs numerical constants or reformat expressions (e.g., 10% to 300%). 4) Code Mutation: inserts control structures or replaces API calls. Formally, our mutation model LLM\ud835\udc40processes each program \ud835\udc50\u2208C through \ud835\udc58iterative refinements: C\ud835\udc40= \u00d8 \ud835\udc50\u2208C \ud835\udc58\u00d8 \ud835\udc5a=1 LLM\ud835\udc40(\ud835\udc50, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5a) where \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5adenotes mutation templates guiding specific complex- ity enhancements. Finally, we combine the original and mutated programs to form the final program set bC = C \u222aC\ud835\udc40, which not only ensures the diversity of the programs but also significantly enhances their complexity and quantity. Guaranteeing Correctness via Bilateral Verification. The pro- grams in C can be translated back into question-solution pairs, constructing a mathematical corpus in natural language. However, this strategy raises challenges from two aspects: 1) Consistency: the reverse-engineered natural language problem should align with the code. 2) Validity: the problem should be clearly defined and solvable. Due to the current limitations of LLMs, these issues cannot be fully resolved. Moreover, our mutation strategy for mathematical",
    "language. However, this strategy raises challenges from two aspects: 1) Consistency: the reverse-engineered natural language problem should align with the code. 2) Validity: the problem should be clearly defined and solvable. Due to the current limitations of LLMs, these issues cannot be fully resolved. Moreover, our mutation strategy for mathematical pro- grams exacerbates these challenges, leading to unreliable synthetic data. To address this, we adopt a bilateral verification mechanism to ensure the correctness of the synthesized data, i.e., execute the pro- grams and compare the outputs with the LLM-generated solutions. Our verification mechanism operates through three core steps for each program \ud835\udc50\u2208C: (1) Question Generation: produce question \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc50via LLMs, i.e., \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc50= LLM\ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc50, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5e). (2) Answer Extraction: derive answers through dual channels: \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc50= LLM\ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc50, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc60) \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50= regex_extract(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc50) \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc50= Interpreter(\ud835\udc50). In practice, we sample multiple solutions for each question to scale the quantity of data. (3) Cross-Verification: construct verified corpus: D = {(\ud835\udc50,\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc50,\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc50) | \ud835\udc50\u2208bC \u2227\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\u2261\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc50}. Note that errors at any step from \u201c\ud835\udc50\u2192\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc50\u2192\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc50\u2192\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\u201d can lead to inconsistencies between \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50and \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc50. Thus, our two-sided verification mechanism not only ensures the correctness of semantic translation (code \u2192 question) and logical derivation (question \u2192solution). This process ultimately results in a correctness-guaranteed math corpus D. A CIKM \u201925, November 10\u201314, 2025, Seoul, Republic of Korea Chen and Tian, et al.

Among these samples, there are 1.8 million unique program-question pairs, averaging about 6.8 solu- tions per pair. Following established methodologies, we filter out instances with 10-gram overlaps in both inputs and outputs from the test sets of downstream evaluation tasks. The filtered synthesis data are then used to fine-tune open-source LLMs, enabling them to predict solutions based on the given problems. 3 Experiments 3.1 Experimental Settings We follow existing work [10], applying LoRA to perform supervised fine-tuning on three pre-trained models: LLaMA3-8B [6], Mistral- 7B [8], and Deepseek-Math-7B [15]. To evaluate the effectiveness of AMD, we assess the accuracy before and after fine-tuning on four benchmarks: GSM8K [4], MATH [7], Minerva_Math [9], and SVAMP [14].

To ensure a fair evalua- tion of data quality, we randomly sample 50,000 instances from the publicly available training datasets of each method for fine-tuning. 3.2 Overall Performance Table 1 presents a comprehensive performance comparison between AMD and the baseline mathematical data synthesis approach across three base models and four mathematical reasoning benchmarks. The results demonstrate that AMD consistently outperforms Math- Genie in most settings, particularly showing significant gains on weaker base models like LLaMA3-8B. While MathGenie occasion- ally achieves marginal advantages in specific configurations, AMD exhibits more robust performance across different model architec- tures and task domains. The consistent superior performance across heterogeneous evaluation metrics confirms AMD\u2019s effectiveness in generating high-quality mathematical training data. 3.3 Ablation Study The ablation studies of two data synthesis pathways and two lan- guages are shown in Table 2 and Table 3. When combining knowl- edge system-derived data and seed corpus expansion, all models achieve optimal or near-optimal performance across benchmarks. The ablation study of different languages shows that our method is effective in both Chinese and English, and combining data from both languages will not reduce the performance of the model.

    "mathematical reasoning, current methods often employ chain of thoughts (CoT) hints on general models [19], or enhance models by pre-training or fine-tuning with specialized mathematical datasets to improve their performance [3, 15]. How- ever, the large amount of mathematical data required by these methods is difficult to collect manually, so there has been a surge in methods for automatically synthesizing high-quality mathematical datasets in recent years. Jiuzhang [23] creates a knowledge distil- lation dataset to train a small LLM for generating mathematical content. MathGenie [12] generates mathematical problems with corresponding codes to verify the correctness of the solutions, but it lacks diversity because its data is not combined and developed from a mathematical perspective. Neuro-Symbolic Data Genera- tion [10] introduces a symbolic system to convert and mutate the original text into new symbolic problems, enhancing the diversity of the problems with correctness by verifying the solutions with their symbolic representation. However, its mutation methods are confined to some pre-defined patterns, limiting the complexity of the generated content. 5 Conclusion In this work, we propose a novel mathematical data synthesis para- digm, build a comprehensive mathematical knowledge system and a corresponding mathematical toolkit. We implement knowledge system-driven mathematical program synthesis and correctness- guaranteed mathematical corpus synthesis, replacing traditional corpus synthesis that completely relies on LLMs with external tool generation that considers diversity, complexity, and correctness. Ex- periments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our synthetic data and that our synthesis method is superior to traditional methods.

    "LLM-based Contrastive Self-Supervised AMR Learning with Masked Graph Autoencoders for Fake News Detection Shubham Gupta1*, Shraban Chatterjee1*, Suman Kundu1 1Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India gupta.37@iitj.ac.in, chatterjee.2@iitj.ac.in, suman@iitj.ac.in Abstract The proliferation of misinformation in the digital age has led to significant societal challenges. Existing approaches of- ten struggle with capturing long-range dependencies, com- plex semantic relations, and the social dynamics influenc- ing news dissemination. Furthermore, these methods re- quire extensive labelled datasets, making their deployment resource-intensive. In this study, we propose a novel self- supervised misinformation detection framework that inte- grates both complex semantic relations using Abstract Mean- ing Representation (AMR) and news propagation dynamics. We introduce an LLM-based graph contrastive loss (LGCL) that utilizes negative anchor points generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance feature separability in a zero-shot manner. To incorporate social context, we employ a multi view graph masked autoencoder, which learns news propagation features from social context graph. By combin- ing these semantic and propagation-based features, our ap- proach effectively differentiates between fake and real news in a self-supervised manner. Extensive experiments demon- strate that our self-supervised framework achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methodolo- gies, even with limited labelled datasets while improving gen- eralizability. Introduction The spread of misinformation has become a significant prob- lem in the digital age. It can lead to social unrest, foster ha- tred, erode trust, and ultimately impede the overall progress and stability of the society (Dewatana and Adillah 2021). Hence, effectively detecting misinformation has become an essential challenge to solve. The concept of the \u201cveracity problem on the web\u201d was first introduced by (Yin, Han, and Yu 2008) by designing a solution called TruthFinder. This method verified news content by cross-referencing it with information from rep- utable websites. Later, (Feng, Banerjee, and Choi 2012) em- ployed manually crafted textual features for detecting mis- information. However, manually crafted features are time- consuming to create and fail to capture the complex se- mantic relations present in the text. Subsequently, many researchers turned to more advanced techniques, utilizing *These authors contributed equally.

For example, RNNs are employed to capture local and temporal dependencies within text data (Ma et al. 2016a; Li et al. 2022) and BERT has been increasingly utilized to improve the comprehen- sion of contextual relationships in news articles (Devlin et al. 2019). Key limitations of these approaches are their struggle to maintain longer text dependencies and they do not capture complex semantic relations, such as events, locations, and trigger words. (Gupta, Rajora, and Kundu 2025) solves this problem but requires supervision. Additionally, these mod- els often neglect the social context and dynamics that influ- ence news propagation (Yuan et al. 2019). Acknowledging this, researchers have introduced graph-based approaches that integrate social context into the detection process (Min et al. 2022; Sun et al. 2022; Li et al. 2024). Despite their effectiveness, these methods rely heavily on large, labelled datasets for training. Collecting and annotating such exten- sive datasets is time-consuming and resource-intensive, lim- iting their practical implementation. To address this (Yin et al. 2024) propose a model to generate unsupervised fea- tures from the social context graph but do not consider the semantic relationship within the text. Therefore, we require a model that is capable of incorporating semantic text fea- tures, a social context propagation graph and also perform arXiv:2508.18819v1 [cs.CL] 26 Aug 2025 well with minimal labelled data as highlighted in Table 1. This paper proposes a novel self-supervised misinforma- tion detection methodology that considers complex semantic relations among entities in the news and the propagation of the news as a social context graph. In order to identify the se- mantic relations, this method incorporates a self-supervised Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) encoder using the proposed graph contrastive loss. This loss creates feature separation by sampling negative anchor points using LLM. The use of negative anchor points from LLM helps in in- creasing the separation between fake and real classes in the latent space. In order to integrate the social context and cap- ture the propagation of the news, our methodology also in- tegrates a multi-view Graph Masked Autoencoder that em- ploys the context and content of the news propagation pro- cess as the self-supervised signal to enhance the final fea- ture space.

Related Work In this section, we provide a concise overview of the ap- proaches utilized for detecting misinformation. The rele- vant studies are categorized into two main components: misinformation detection and self-supervised graph learning methodologies. Misinformation Detection Methods Early research on misinformation detection focused on man- ually crafted linguistic features (Feng, Banerjee, and Choi 2012; Ma et al. 2016b; Long et al. 2017), requiring sig- nificant effort for evaluation. EANN (Wang et al. 2018) is proposed to effectively extract event-invariant features from multimedia content, thereby enhancing the detection of mis- information on newly arrived events. In this line of work, recently, FakeFlow (Ghanem et al. 2021) classified news us- ing lexical features and affective information. In a separate line of work, external knowledge was integrated to improve model performance. Different source of external knowledge was used. For example, Popat et al. (Popat et al. 2017) re- trieved external articles to model interactions; KAN (Dun et al. 2021) and CompareNet (Hu et al. 2021) leveraged Wikidata for domain expansion, while KGML (Yao et al. 2021) bridged meta-training and meta-testing using knowl- edge bases. Further, researchers have developed graph-based methods that incorporate social context into the detection process, for example, authors of GTUT (Gangireddy et al. 2020) construct a graph for initial fake news spreader iden- tification, (UMD)2 (Silva et al. 2024) considers user credi- bility and propagation speed, GACL (Sun et al. 2022) con- structs a tree of tweets for contrastive learning. All these methods do not leverage the complete propagation graph, and GACL requires supervision. Other graph-based meth- ods like (Min et al. 2022; Li et al. 2024) rely heavily on manual annotation and external data. Recently, Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR)- based methods emerged to mitigate long-text dependency.",
    "for contrastive learning. All these methods do not leverage the complete propagation graph, and GACL requires supervision. Other graph-based meth- ods like (Min et al. 2022; Li et al. 2024) rely heavily on manual annotation and external data. Recently, Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR)- based methods emerged to mitigate long-text dependency. Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), as introduced by (Banarescu et al. 2013), captures relationships between nodes using PropBank framesets. Recently, Zhang et al. (Zhang et al. 2023) utilized AMR to detect out-of-context multimodal misinformation by identifying discrepancies be- tween textual and visual data. In (Gupta et al. 2023), authors encoded textual information using AMR and explored how its semantic relations influence the veracity assessment of news. However, this study lacked sufficient evidence or jus- tification for entity relationships within the AMR graph. Fur- ther, in the integration of evidence in AMR, EA2N (Gupta, Rajora, and Kundu 2025) is proposed that effectively cap- tures evidence among entities present in AMR. All of these approaches rely on supervised data for AMR training and have not explored the potential of unsupervised methods. Self-Supervised Graph Learning Self-supervised graph learning harnesses the structured rich- ness of graph data to derive meaningful representations without relying on explicit labels (Wu et al. 2023). A Graph Auto-Encoder (GAE) based model proposed that learns low- dimensional graph representations (Kipf and Welling 2016). Later studies improved GAEs by focusing on reconstruct- ing masked node features to enhance self-supervised learn- ing for classification (Hou et al. 2022). Further, (Hou et al. 2023) improved the performance by introducing multi-view random remasking. Recently, an unsupervised method for detecting misinformation GAMC (Yin et al. 2024) has been proposed by leveraging both the context and content of news propagation as self-supervised signals. However, GAMC does not effectively handle complex semantic relations for longer text dependencies. Methodology The overall methodology is presented in Figure 1. In this section we present these in more detail. Self-supervised AMR Graph Learning Given an input text T, we first create the AMR graph Gamr(Vamr, Eamr) capturing the relationships between dif- ferent entities. AMR generation process involves parsing the sentences to extract linguistic information, including seman- tic roles, relations, and core events. In order to incorporate reasoning through AMR, we have integrated the external :mod execute man house highway man2 mask pardon person Obama :arg0 :arg1 :location :arg1-of :arg1-of :arg0 :name Obama Sainaw execute man house highway man2 mask pardon person :arg0 :arg1 :mod :location :arg1-of :arg1-of :arg0 :name Demarlen Thomas name living place Multi-view Autoencoder Loss drop edge remask Man pardoned by Obama executed by masked men at halfway house.

Gamr is then linked to external evidences from Wikipedia represented as GW ikiAMR. This GW ikiAMR graph is then converted to latent space features HGamr by the graph transformer E\u03b4 based on Llgcl optimization. The propagation graph of the same news article is then extracted and multiple augmentations are created. These augmented graphs are then passed to our multi-view remasked graph autoencoder which is optimized using Lprop. The propagation graph feature HGprop for each news is extracted from the trained GNN encoder. The final features for misinformation classification are obtained by concatenating HGamr and HGprop. evidence by using the Evidence Linking Algorithm (ELA) used in (Gupta, Rajora, and Kundu 2025). The graph af- ter applying ELA is referred to as WikiAMR, represented as GW ikiAMR. In the paper, authors have shown the impor- tance of WikiAMR over AMR. WikiAMR comprises inter- connected undirected paths between entity nodes in Gamr generated from the text. The WikiAMR representation helps to distinguish the difference between real and fake articles. AMR Graph Learning with Path Optimization: This module plays an important role in extracting meaningful fea- tures from the given WikiAMR graph. Features extracted here capture essential semantic relationships, enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying textual data. At the core of this module is a Graph Transformer (Cai and Lam 2020), which employs various attention mechanisms to ef- fectively process the graph representation. This allows the model to reason about and learn from the text more compre- hensively. The WikiAMR graph is first passed through a node ini- tialization and relation encoder to transform it into a repre- sentation in Rn\u00d7k\u00d7d, where n, k, and d denote the batch size, maximum sequence length, and the dimensionality of the graph encoding, respectively. To facilitate the model in identifying specific paths within GW ikiAMR, the relation en- coder computes the shortest path between two entities. This sequence of the path is subsequently converted into a rela- tion vector using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based RNN (Cho et al. 2014). qt is the sequence encoding extracted from GRU to get the relation vector ruv. The mathematical formu- lation for this encoding is given by: \u2212\u2192q t = GRUf(\u2212\u2192q t\u22121, spt) \u2190\u2212q t = GRUb(\u2190\u2212q t+1, spt) Here, spt represents the shortest path",
    "Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based RNN (Cho et al. 2014). qt is the sequence encoding extracted from GRU to get the relation vector ruv. The mathematical formu- lation for this encoding is given by: \u2212\u2192q t = GRUf(\u2212\u2192q t\u22121, spt) \u2190\u2212q t = GRUb(\u2190\u2212q t+1, spt) Here, spt represents the shortest path between two entities. Formally, the shortest relation path spi\u2192j = [e(u, k1), e(k1, k2), . . . , e(kn, v)] between the node u and the node v, where e(\u00b7, \u00b7) indicates the edge label and k1:n are the relay nodes. To compute the attention scores, the final re- lational encoding ruv is split into two distinct components, ru\u2192v and rv\u2192u, via a linear transformation with a parameter matrix Wr: ruv = [\u2212\u2192q n; \u2190\u2212q 0], [ru\u2192v; rv\u2192u] = Wrruv Subsequently, attention scores \u03b2uv are calculated by in- corporating both entity and relation representations from the graph GW ikiAMR: \u03b2uv = h(eu, ev, ruv) = (eu + ru\u2192v)W \u22a4 p Wk(ev + rv\u2192u) = euW \u22a4 p Wkev | {z } a + euW \u22a4 p Wkrv\u2192u | {z } b + ru\u2192vW \u22a4 p Wkev | {z } c + ru\u2192vW \u22a4 p Wkrv\u2192u | {z } d (1) The attention weights computed here guide the focus on entities according to their relationships. Each term in Equa- tion 1 serves a distinct purpose: (a) models content-based attention, (b) captures biases related to the source of the re- lationship, (c) addresses biases from the target, and (d) en- codes a general relational bias, providing a comprehensive view of entity interactions. Finally, the Graph Transformer (E\u03b4) encodes GW ikiAMR, producing the final graph repre- sentation as follows: HGamr = E\u03b4(GW ikiAMR) \u2208Rn\u00d7k\u00d7d (2) Here, HGamr represents the output graph embeddings generated by the Graph Transformer, and d is the feature dimensionality. Graph Contrastive Loss: Our proposed LLM-based graph contrastive loss (LGCL) function comprises two pri- mary objectives. The first objective aims to ensure that the graph embedding remains close to its original embedding space by minimizing the reconstruction error between the predicted feature and the original feature. The second objec- tive seeks to maximize the divergence between the predicted feature and the negative sample feature. To quantify the sim- ilarity between features, we utilize the Scaled Cosine Error (SCE) (Hou et al. 2022). Formally, given the original feature Y and the reconstructed output Y \u2032, SCE is defined as: LSCE = 1 |N| X n\u2208N \u0012 1 \u2212 yT i y\u2032 i \u2225yi\u2225\u00b7 \u2225y\u2032 i\u2225 \u0013\u03b3 , \u03b3 \u22651 (3) Here, \u03b3 is a scaling factor. When predictions have high con- fidence, the resulting cosine errors are generally less than 1 and diminish more quickly towards zero as the scaling factor",

When predictions have high con- fidence, the resulting cosine errors are generally less than 1 and diminish more quickly towards zero as the scaling factor \u03b3 > 1. The contrastive loss requires both a positive sample fea- ture ypos and a negative sample feature yneg to compare against the predicted feature. In the proposed formulation, HGamr is used as y\u2032, ypos is the original BERT-derived fea- ture of the input text, while yneg is a negative sample fea- ture generated using an LLM-based negative sampler. The final contrastive loss for graph-based self-supervised learn- ing (SSL) is formulated as follows: Llgcl =LSCE(y\u2032, ypos) + \u03bb \u00b7 max (0, m \u2212LSCE(y\u2032, yneg)) (4) Here, \u03bb is a weighting factor, and m is the margin to ensure negatives are pushed apart in cosine space. LLM-based Negative Sampler: We employ a large lan- guage model (LLM) in zero-shot to facilitate effective con- trastive learning. Specifically, LLaMA3-7B is used to gener- ate negative samples (yneg). This approach leverages the rea- soning capabilities of the LLM to distinguish between real and fake input samples, assigning them pseudo labels for the selection of the negative feature for the contrastive learning task. Let X = {x1, x2, . . . , xn} denote the set of input fea- tures. The input prompt and output format used for the LLM is mentioned in the end of the section. For each in- put xi \u2208X, the LLM assigns a pseudo label eyi \u2208{0, 1}, where: eyi = \u001a1 if xi is labelled as real, 0 if xi is labelled as fake. Using the LLM\u2019s output labels, we partition the input samples into two groups: Xreal = {xi | eyi = 1}, Xfake = {xi | eyi = 0}. We compute the centroids of the real and fake samples as, creal = 1 |Xreal| X xi\u2208Xreal fi, cfake = 1 |Xfake| X xi\u2208Xfake fi. where a feature vector fi \u2208Rn\u00d7k\u00d7d is the initial BERT fea- ture corresponding to xi. The negative sample (yneg) is cho- sen to maximize the contrastive loss. In particular, we use cfake as the representative negative sample for the real input sample, while creal is used as the negative sample for the fake input sample. By leveraging the LLM to reason over input samples and compute these centroids, our approach effec- tively selects meaningful negative samples, enhancing the discriminative power of the contrastive learning model. LLM\u2019s Zero Shot Input Prompt: Write in one word among \u2018real\u2019 or \u2018fake\u2019 whether given text is real or fake. {text} LLM\u2019s Output: fake/real Multi-View Social Context",

Nodes in V represent one news article and users who forward that arti- cle. An edge in E exists between two nodes if there exists a forwarding relationship between them. The features for the news node are generated by passing the news article to a pre-trained language model (BERT), and the features for the user nodes are generated based on their recent 200 posts. The news and user node features are collectively referred to as F. Graph Augmentation: We use two augmentation strate- gies: 1 feature masking and 2 random edge removal for creating augmentations of the input graph as suggested in (Yin et al. 2024). For input feature masking, we randomly select 50% nodes in the graph and replace their features with a masked token. For 2 , we randomly remove 20% edges from the graph. Each augmented graph for Gprop is denoted as Gprop i . Graph Encoding: We encode each Gprop i into a latent space representation using a GNN encoder. For this, we use GIN (Xu et al. 2019) represented using Equation 5 as it is theoretically proven to distinguish between graph structures. f (k) v = MLP \uf8eb \uf8ed(1 + \u03f5) \u00b7 f (k\u22121) v + X u\u2208N(v) f (k\u22121) u \uf8f6 \uf8f8 (5) Here, f (k) v is embedding of node v at layer k, N(v) contains neighbors of node v and \u03f5 is a learnable scalar controlling residual connections. The final node embeddings from the encoder for each Gprop i is represented as F Gprop i enc . For downstream classification tasks on Gprop we use the graph embedding HGprop calculated as: HGprop = 1 |V | X v\u2208V fv \u2208FGprop enc (6) Multi-View Graph Decoding: Now, from the encoded node representations F Gprop i enc , we decode the input node fea- tures F using GIN as a decoder. In (Yin et al. 2024) the authors use a single stage remasking for each F Gprop i enc to re- construct the input features. But authors in (Hou et al. 2023) have shown that feature reconstruction is susceptible to con- gruence among the input features, which single remasking cannot address. To address this, we introduce multi-view feature remasking of each augmented graph F Gprop i enc . Each remasked",

But authors in (Hou et al. 2023) have shown that feature reconstruction is susceptible to con- gruence among the input features, which single remasking cannot address. To address this, we introduce multi-view feature remasking of each augmented graph F Gprop i enc . Each remasked encoded feature is denoted by F Gprop i encj . It acts as a regularizer for the decoder, making it robust against un- expected noises in input and helping to avoid overfitting. The final objective of the decoder is to reconstruct the actual node features F from these masked encoded node features using the multi-view autoencoder loss described next. Multi-View Autoencoder Loss: Given k augmentations of the input graph Gprop represented as Gprop 1 , . . . , Gprop k , and m remasked decoded output for each augmented graph represented as F Gprop 1 dec1 , . . . , F Gprop 1 decm , . . . , F Gprop k decm , we define the multi-view reconstruction loss as Lmrec = k X i=1 m X j=1 (F \u2212F Gprop i decj ) (7) To minimize the divergence across the views of the decoded features, we define the multi-view cosine similarity loss as Lmcos = M \u2200l,i,j; if l=l\u2032 then i\u0338=j l\u2264k,i\u2264m,j\u2264m F Gprop l deci .F Gprop l\u2032 decj F Gprop l deci . F Gprop l\u2032 decj (8) Here, M is the mean operation. Our final propagation loss is Lprop = Lmrec + Lmcos. Final Loss We combine the AMR and Propagation loss as L = Llgcl + Lprop. We train our model using this loss, and the final fea- tures of our model are HGamr \u00b7 HGprop. These features are then used for misinformation classification. Experiments and Results We perform experiments on the publicly available datasets FakeNewsNet (Shu et al. 2020) in order to assess the effec- tiveness of the model. This repository contains two separate benchmark datasets, namely, PolitiFact and GossipCop. Fur- ther details on the datasets and implementation of our model are provided in the supplementary document. Baselines: In our evaluation, we contrast our model with various state-of-the-art baselines, categorized into two groups. The first group utilizes only unsupervised methods (TruthFinder (Yin, Han, and Yu 2008), UFNDA (Li et al. 2021), UFD (Yang et al. 2022), GTUT (Gangireddy et al. 2020), (UMD)2 (Silva et al. 2024), GraphMAE (Hou et al. 2022), GAMC (Yin et al. 2024)), while the second incorpo- rates supervised methods (SAFE (Zhou, Wu, and Zafarani 2020), EANN (Wang et al. 2018), dEFEND (Shu et al. 2019), GACL (Sun et al. 2022), EA2N (BERT) (Gupta, Ra- jora, and Kundu 2025)). Results We conducted a comparative analysis of our model",
    "GAMC (Yin et al. 2024)), while the second incorpo- rates supervised methods (SAFE (Zhou, Wu, and Zafarani 2020), EANN (Wang et al. 2018), dEFEND (Shu et al. 2019), GACL (Sun et al. 2022), EA2N (BERT) (Gupta, Ra- jora, and Kundu 2025)). Results We conducted a comparative analysis of our model against various unsupervised and supervised baselines on the Poli- tiFact and GossipCop datasets. As shown in Table 2, our model achieved the highest accuracy (0.919), precision (0.933), recall (0.903), and F1-score (0.918) among the unsupervised baselines. Compared to GAMC, the existing benchmark, our model outperforms it by a margin of 8.1% in accuracy and 8.7% in F1-score (on the absolute scale). Also, our model surpasses GTUT and (UMD)2 by signifi- cant margins, 12 \u223c14% in accuracy and 14 \u223c15% in the F1-score, indicating a superior ability to differentiate be- tween fake and real news. In a similar context, as shown in Table 3, our model significantly outperforms existing unsu- pervised baselines on the GossipCop dataset. It achieves the highest accuracy (0.968), precision (0.965), recall (0.967), and F1-score (0.966), outperforming GAMC, which attained an accuracy of 0.946 and an F1-score of 0.943. This repre- sents a 2.2% improvement in accuracy and a 2.3% improve- ment in the F1-score. This improvement can be attributed to the proposed model, which leverages a combination of self-supervised AMR semantic features and news propaga- tion features from multi-view social context graph learning. When we compare our model to supervised baselines on both PolitiFact and GossipCop datasets (Table 4), it con- sistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy, while comparable results on F1 score are ob- served. On PolitiFact, our model achieves an accuracy of 0.919 and an F1-score of 0.933, surpassing EA2N with BERT (0.911 accuracy, 0.915 F1-score), GACL (0.867 ac- curacy, 0.866 F1-score), and EANN (0.804 accuracy, 0.798 F1-score). However, it shows comparative performance with dEFEND in F1-score. On GossipCop, our model outper- forms all supervised baselines, achieving the highest ac- curacy (0.968) and F1-score (0.966). It notably surpasses GACL (0.907 accuracy, 0.905 F1-score) and EA2N (0.844 accuracy, 0.872 F1-score), as well as dEFEND, which lags significantly behind with 0.808 accuracy and 0.755 F1- score. These results highlight that while supervised models perform well, our self-supervised approach not only com- petes effectively on PolitiFact but outperforms all super- vised baselines on GossipCop, demonstrating superior per- formance across datasets. Our self-supervised pipeline may yield stronger representations than shallow supervised mod- els trained only on labels. One reason is that the datasets have known issues with label reliability. In such cases, su- pervised models can overfit to spurious correlations or un- reliable labels and unsupervised models often rely on rep- resentation learning, which can be more",

It is evident that the accuracy improved initially with the value of \u03bb and obtained the maximum result when \u03bb = 0.5 for both datasets. With a further increase in \u03bb, the accuracy decreases, indicating that our model overempha- sizes negative samples compared to being close to positive samples, thus decreasing feature separability. Based on this, we set the value of \u03bb to 0.5 in our experiments. Figure 2: Change in classification result with different values of \u03bb.

The results clearly demonstrate that the classification accuracy improves with larger train- ing data, which is consistent with expectations. Notably, our proposed model consistently outperforms traditional unsu- pervised baselines even with limited training samples, par- ticularly in low-resource settings. With just 10% of the train- ing data, our model achieves superior performance on both the GossipCop and PolitiFact, highlighting its effectiveness in data-scarce scenarios. This showcases the robustness and generalization ability of the learned representations. Change in results with varying number of augmentations k and multi-view remaskings m: We study the change in classification accuracy with different numbers of augmen- tations and remaskings for the PolitiFact dataset (Figure 3). We can infer from the figure that the best results are obtained when we set k = 2 and m \u22646. This shows that multi-view remaskings help the model achieve superior performance, but more than three remaskings do not bring considerable improvements.

    "We use two popular models, Mistral-7B and LLaMA- 7B. We show the results when we use the LLMs indepen- dently for zero-shot classification. Our model significantly improves the classification results using information from the LLM. One must also note that there is a significant dif- ference between the results from the two LLMs when used independently. But, when used with any component of our model, this difference reduces, thus showing the robustness of the extracted features by the proposed method. Qualitative results at different stages of our proposed pipeline In Figure 4 we show the feature separation be- tween the real and fake news at different stages of our pro- posed pipeline. In the first row of the Figure we see the results of PolitiFact dataset and the second row we show the results of the GossipCop dataset. The first column of each row shows the TSNE embedding of the initial fea- tures. The second column shows the TSNE plot of the original features after a single fully connected linear layer (MLP). The third column shows the TSNE plot of the fea- tures obtained after the self-supervised AMR graph learning (HGamr) phase trained with a linear layer. The last columns shows the TSNE plot of the final concatenated features after self-supervised AMR graph learning and multi-view propa- Figure 4: The TSNE plots showing the embeddings of Poli- tiFact (Row1) and GossipCop (Row2). gation graph learning (HGamr.HGprop) with a linear layer. In all the cases we train the MLP with 80% labelled data. To quantify the clustering quality, we compute the silhou- ette score at each stage. For the PolitiFact dataset, the sil- houette scores are 0.33, 0.54, 0.62, and 0.64, respectively, indicating progressively better separation between real and fake news as the pipeline advances. Similarly, for the Gos- sipCop dataset, the silhouette scores are 0.16, 0.34, 0.38, and 0.40, again demonstrating consistent improvement. These quantitative results further support the visual evidence, con- firming that our model increasingly enhances feature dis- criminability at each stage of the pipeline. Conclusion This study presents a novel self-supervised approach for misinformation detection. The LLM-based contrastive self- supervised AMR learning framework captures complex se- mantic relationships in text. This method enhances fea- ture separation between real and fake news by leverag- ing an LLM-based negative sampler. Additionally, we in- troduce a multi-view graph-masked autoencoder that in- tegrates social context and news propagation patterns for more robust detection. Through extensive experiments, the proposed method is found to produce state-of-the-art per- formance. Beyond misinformation detection, our method- ology has broader applications in NLP.

Beyond misinformation detection, our method- ology has broader applications in NLP. For instance, self- supervised AMR graph learning can be applied to tasks like question-answering and event detection, while multi-view social context and propagation graph learning can be lever- aged for hate speech and aggression detection, etc. This work not only advances misinformation detection but also lays the groundwork for tackling various NLP challenges us- ing graph-based learning in constraint settings.

These datasets also capture the broader social dynamics by including information about how news spreads through networks and the posting patterns of users.

For LGCL, we use \u03b1 = 0.5 and in order to integrate the evidence in the AMR graph, we use the same parameters described in (Gupta, Rajora, and Kundu 2025). For social context and propagation graph learning we use 2 encoder layers and 1 decoder layer. For multi-view remasking, we select k = 2 and m = 2. We selected Support Vector Ma- chine (SVM) as the final classifier and reported the results from 80 % of the training data with 5-fold cross-validation. Although we provided our results for each test size percent- age in result table, our main results are based on an 80:20 train-test split to ensure consistency with other methods. We have trained our model on RTX A5000 Nvidia GPU with 24 GB GPU memory. The training of AMR took 1 hour for PolitiFact and took 3 hours for the GossipCop dataset with 50 epochs. Multi-view masked graph learning took 5 mins for the PolitiFact dataset and 15 minutes for the GossipCop dataset."

These documents typically interleave natural language with domain-specific syntax, such as mathematical equations, tables, figures, and cross-references, all of which must be accu- rately preserved to maintain semantic integrity and compilability. In this paper, we introduce LaTeXTrans, a collaborative multi-agent sys- tem designed to address this challenge. LaTeX- Trans ensures format preservation, structural fidelity, and terminology consistency through six specialized agents: 1) a Parser that decom- poses LaTeX into translation-friendly units via placeholder substitution and syntax filtering; 2) a Translator, Validator, Summarizer, and Ter- minology Extractor that work collaboratively to ensure context-aware, self-correcting, and terminology-consistent translations; 3) a Gener- ator that reconstructs the translated content into well-structured LaTeX documents. Experimen- tal results demonstrate that LaTeXTrans can outperform mainstream MT systems in both translation accuracy and structural fidelity, of- fering an effective and practical solution for translating LaTeX-formatted documents. System Video 1 Introduction LaTeX is a widely adopted macro package sys- tem built on top of TeX, designed to facilitate the typesetting of complex and structured documents. It has become the de facto standard for scholarly publications across a wide range of scientific disci- plines. According to recent statistics, nearly 98% of scientific papers are published in English, while only about 3% of the global population speaks En- glish as their first language (Kleidermacher and *Authors contributed equally. \u2020Corresponding author. Zou, 2025). This linguistic disparity places con- siderable pressure on non-native English speak- ers, who are frequently required to read or write LaTeX-formatted documents in English. As a re- sult, the technical barriers to academic learning and research are significantly increased. A straightforward approach to ease this burden is to translate LaTeX documents into the user\u2019s native language by processing the compiled PDF version, a process referred to as PDF translation. However, this approach often results in incomplete formatting due to errors in PDF parsing. In contrast, a more promising alternative is to translate directly at the LaTeX source level and then compile the translated content into a target-language PDF document. This approach can preserve structural information and allows better control over formatting. However, translating LaTeX source files presents unique challenges not encountered in plain-text translation. LaTeX documents interleave natural language with domain-specific markup, such as mathematical equations, citation commands, and formatting environments, all of which must be",

However, translating LaTeX source files presents unique challenges not encountered in plain-text translation. LaTeX documents interleave natural language with domain-specific markup, such as mathematical equations, citation commands, and formatting environments, all of which must be pre- cisely preserved to ensure semantic correctness and successful compilation. Naively applying standard MT systems to LaTeX code typically leads to bro- ken syntax, semantic errors, or formatting loss, ul- timately hindering rather than helping the user. To address these challenges, in this paper, we introduce LaTeXTrans, a collaborative multi-agent system designed to directly translate LaTeX source files while preserving their structural and semantic integrity. Our LaTeXTrans operates on raw LaTeX code and maintains the full syntactic and semantic structure of the document throughout the entire translation pipeline. Specifically, it comprises three modules and six specialized agents: \u2022 Parsing Module: Responsible for fine-grained analysis of LaTeX-formatted documents. To handle the structural complexity of LaTeX, we 1 arXiv:2508.18791v1 [cs.CL] 26 Aug 2025 design a Parser agent equipped with a place- holder mechanism and a syntax filter, which together decompose the source into manage- able translation units. \u2022 Translation Module: This module leverages a team of collaborative agents, including a Translator, Validator, Summarizer, and Termi- nology Extractor, which work together to per- form context-aware and self-correcting trans- lation of the parsed units. \u2022 Generation Module: A Generator agent recon- structs the translated document by reinserting the translated content into the original LaTeX structure, producing well-formatted LaTeX source in the target language. To evaluate the effectiveness of LaTeXTrans, we first construct a LaTeX source test set using TeX files collected from arXiv papers. We then compare LaTeXTrans with a range of MT and LLM-based translation baselines. Experimental results demon- strate that LaTeXTrans consistently outperforms all baselines in both translation accuracy and for- mat fidelity. Notably, LaTeXTrans achieves an im- provement of 13.20 points on FC-score, along with significant gains in COMETkiwi and LLM-score when compared to GPT-4o. 2 Related works LLM-based Machine Translation. The emer- gence of LLMs has introduced a new paradigm for MT, shifting away from traditional supervised learning on parallel corpora toward more flexible, general-purpose language understanding (Gain et al., 2025). LLMs like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), and GPT-4 demonstrate strong multilingual capabilities with- out explicit training on translation tasks. LLM- based translation leverages in-context learning, where the model is prompted with examples or instructions to perform translation on the fly. This approach has shown competitive performance in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios (Vilar et al., 2023), especially for high-resource language pairs. Unlike traditional neural machine translation (NMT), which requires retraining or fine-tuning for",

This approach has shown competitive performance in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios (Vilar et al., 2023), especially for high-resource language pairs. Unlike traditional neural machine translation (NMT), which requires retraining or fine-tuning for each new domain or language, LLMs can gen- eralize across tasks and languages with minimal additional data. Multi-Agent Systems. More recently, the emer- gence of LLMs has opened new possibilities for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). In LLM-based multi- agent systems, each agent is instantiated as an LLM-powered entity capable of natural language reasoning, planning, and collaboration. Systems such as AutoGPT (Yang et al., 2023), CAMEL (Li et al., 2023), and AutoGen (Dibia et al., 2024) demonstrate that LLM agents can simulate di- verse roles and complete complex tasks through dialogue-based coordination. A growing number of studies explore the use of multi-agent systems for translation-related tasks. Notably, MAS has emerged as a promising solution for document- level translation (Wang et al., 2024), a long- standing challenge in MT. Formatted Text Translation. Formatted text translation involves translating documents that con- tain structural or semantic markup, such as La- TeX and XML. These formats often interleave natural language with commands, tags, or tokens that encode formatting, layout, or semantic anno- tations. Although some recent efforts have been made in this direction (Kleidermacher and Zou, 2025; Khan, 2025), formatted text translation still faces two major challenges. The first is the lack of a robust, general-purpose system specifically de- signed for translating formatted content. Currently, only a few proprietary tools, such as Youdao and Baidu, offer relatively effective solutions. While open-source tools like MathTranslate* and GPT- Academic\u2020 have received positive feedback, they still lag behind commercial systems in overall per- formance. The second is the lack of a sound, for- matted text translation evaluation technique. As traditional BLEU or COMET scores do not cover format correctness or tag retention. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a new evaluation technique for structure-aware translation. 3 System Design The key architecture of LaTeXTrans is a multi- agent coordination designed for translating struc- tured LaTeX documents. It consists of three mod- ules: the Parser, the Translation Module, and the Generation Module. The design and functionality of each component are described in detail below. *https://github.com/SUSYUSTC/MathTranslate \u2020https://github.com/binary-husky/gpt_academic 2 1.

To address these challenges, we introduce the Parser module, which serves as the first stage of the LaTeXTrans pipeline. Its basic idea is to transform complex LaTeX documents into clean, structured translation units that are eas- ier for LLMs to process. Specifically, we design a placeholder substitution strategy to temporarily re- place LaTeX-specific commands and environments, and implement a filtering mechanism to remove components that do not require translation. Placeholder Substitution Strategy. For a com- mon LaTeX document, our placeholder substitu- tion strategy is shown in Figure 2. We consider that the original mathematical formulas and charts are retained during translation. The first step is to replace the captions in the chart with placeholders. The second step is to replace the environment with placeholders, which will include the vast majority of mathematical formulas, charts, and other parts that do not need to be translated. Finally, we split the replaced text into sections (including subsec- tions and subsubsections). For a LaTeX project composed of multiple tex files, we first merge the necessary tex files into the main file and then insert placeholders at the beginning and end of the merge for future restoration. The subsequent placeholder replacement rules and segmentation methods are the same as before. From the placeholder substi- tution strategy, we obtain translation units of two granularities: context (i.e., section and environ- ment) and sentence (i.e., caption). Translation Unit Filter. While non-translatable components are replaced with placeholders, we notice that LaTeX allows users to define custom environments, making it infeasible to rely solely on exhaustive rule-based approaches to identify all such segments. To address this issue, we comple- ment a predefined list of protected environments with a Filter agent powered by an",

To address this issue, we comple- ment a predefined list of protected environments with a Filter agent powered by an LLM, which dynamically determines whether a given environ- ment requires translation. Each extracted environ- ment is annotated with a binary label: True or False. The translation module subsequently pro- cesses only those segments labeled as True. 3.2 Translation Module The translation module comprises four agents: the Translator, Validator, Summarizer, and Terminol- ogy Extractor.

The mapping files are the mapping of placeholders and the replaced content, and they are also translation units of different granularities. translation of all designated units, the output is passed to the Validator, which generates an error report and returns it for revision if necessary. The Summarizer and Terminology Extractor assist the Translator by providing a summary of the preced- ing content and a domain-specific terminology dic- tionary, respectively, thereby enhancing contextual coherence and ensuring terminology consistency throughout the translation process. Translator-Validator Iteration. When utilizing large-context windows for document translation, large language models (LLMs) often prioritize cap- turing the overall meaning of the text, which can result in the omission or mistranslation of individ- ual sentences (Wang et al., 2024). This issue is particularly pronounced in LaTeX document trans- lation, where LLMs may neglect or incorrectly render LaTeX commands. For example, the com- mand \u201c\\textbf{}\u201d may be omitted, or \u201c\\left\u201d may be incorrectly translated as \u201c\\\u5de6\u201d. Due to the structured and sensitive syntax of LaTeX, such errors are frequent and can lead to compilation fail- ures. To address this issue, we introduce a Transla- tor\u2013Validator iterative framework, which performs multiple rounds of verification to progressively im- prove LaTeX command preservation for each trans- lation unit. This iterative refinement significantly enhances the usability and reliability of the over- all translation system. Specifically, as illustrated in Figure 1, after the Translator has completed the translation of all translation units, the Validator will verify the quality of the",
    "im- prove LaTeX command preservation for each trans- lation unit. This iterative refinement significantly enhances the usability and reliability of the over- all translation system. Specifically, as illustrated in Figure 1, after the Translator has completed the translation of all translation units, the Validator will verify the quality of the translation from three di- mensions and eventually generate an error report. When conducting the next round of translation, the erroneous translation units, together with the error reports, will form the prompt for the Translator to guide them in generating the correct translation. Summarizer and Terminology Extractor. In- spired by Wang et al. (2024)\u2019s work, we design a Summarizer and Terminology Extractor to enhance the contextual coherence and terminology consis- tency of translation. Specifically, the Summarizer is responsible for constantly generating and updat- ing the summary of the previous text during the translation process. When each translation unit is completed, the Summarizer will combine the previ- ous summary with the original text of the current translation unit to generate a new summary. The Terminology Extractor is responsible for maintain- ing a terminology dictionary and adding it to the prompt of the Translator to provide a reference for terminology translation for the Translator. When the Translator finishes the translation of a transla- tion unit, the Terminology Extractor extracts term pairs from the original text and the translation and updates the term dictionary in real-time. 3.3 Generation Module The generation module is responsible for reassem- bling the translation units into structured LaTeX documents and compiling the structured LaTeX documents into PDF files using specific compilers (e.g. pdfLATEX and XeLATEX). 4 Experiment 4.1 Settings Datasets. Since no publicly available LaTeX doc- ument dataset currently exists, we constructed our test set by selecting the TeX sources of 50 English academic papers from the arXiv repository. The chosen papers include both long and short articles, many of which contain complex formulas and fig- ures, ensuring structural diversity and complexity in the LaTeX content. Further experimental details are provided in Appendix A. Baselines.

Bold indicates the best result in each group. translation systems. For the former, we selected Ni- uTrans and Google Translate as representative sys- tems. For the latter, we evaluated five strong LLMs, including both open-source and proprietary models: LLaMA-3.1-8B (Grattafiori et al., 2024), Qwen-3- 8B (Yang et al., 2025), Qwen-3-14B, DeepSeek-V3 (Liu et al., 2024), and GPT-4o (Hurst et al., 2024). Among these, Qwen-3-14B, DeepSeek-V3, and GPT-4o were further used as the backbone models for agents in LaTeXTrans. 4.2 Evaluation Metrics We conducted a comprehensive assessment of our system from two dimensions: translation quality and format retention ability. Translation Quality. Because high-quality ref- erence translations for LaTeX documents re- quire expert-level annotation, we adopted wmt22- cometkiwi-da (Rei et al., 2022), a reference-free evaluation metric (denoted as Cometkiw), to assess the translation quality of LaTeX documents. Fur- thermore, we employed GPT-4o as an automatic evaluator to further assess translation quality across multiple dimensions, guided by carefully designed system prompts. The evaluation covered four as- pects: Faithfulness, Fluency, Terminology Consis- tency, and Coherence, where each was rated on a scale from 0 to 10. An overall score was then syn- thesized by GPT-4o based on the individual scores across these dimensions (denoted as LLM-score). Format Retention Ability. Whether the labels are completely retained is an important manifes- tation of the ability of the formatted text transla- tion system. However, at present, there is no uni- versal indicator to evaluate the format retention ability of models or systems during the transla- tion process. Therefore, for LaTeX documents, we have designed a new evaluation metric, Format Consistency Score (denoted as FC-score), to as- sess the retention ability of our system for LaTeX labels during the translation process. We can com- pute the FC-score by FC-score = S0 \u2212\u03b1Ne \u2212\u03b2Nw + \u03b3C (1) where S0 is the initial score before the rewards and penalties, \u03b1 is the penalty coefficient per error, \u03b2 is the penalty coefficient per warning, \u03b3 is the reward for successful compilation. Ne and Nw are numbers of errors and warnings, C \u2208{0, 1} indicates whether the LaTeX document compiled successfully. We then clip the score",
    "before the rewards and penalties, \u03b1 is the penalty coefficient per error, \u03b2 is the penalty coefficient per warning, \u03b3 is the reward for successful compilation. Ne and Nw are numbers of errors and warnings, C \u2208{0, 1} indicates whether the LaTeX document compiled successfully. We then clip the score to the valid range [Smin, Smax], Smax and Smin are the upper bound and lower bound of the score (e.g. 0~100). 4.3 Results We evaluate our LaTeXTrans system on two trans- lation tasks: English-to-Chinese (En-Zh) and English-to-Japanese (En-Ja). The results, shown in Table 1, demonstrate that LaTeXTrans consis- tently outperforms both the NMT and Single-Agent baselines across all evaluation metrics, including COMETkiwi and FC-score. In terms of transla- tion quality, LaTeXTrans demonstrates substantial improvements in FC-score (71.52 vs. 58.32 for the En-Zh task and 70.52 vs. 63.68 for the En- Ja task), indicating significantly better preserva- tion of LaTeX formatting during translation.

Introducing the Parser module signifi- cantly improves both COMETkiwi and FC-score, indicating that the placeholder substitution strategy enhances translation quality and label preservation. Adding the Validator module further boosts overall performance, although a slight drop in LLM-score is observed with DeepSeek-V3. We hypothesize that this is due to the Validator enforcing strict tag retention through iterative checks, which may re- strict the Translator and slightly impact fluency. Fi- nally, incorporating the Summarizer and Terminol- ogy Extractor improves the LLM-score, reflecting better cross-paragraph coherence. However, slight declines in COMETkiwi and FC-score suggest that these improvements may not be fully captured by COMETkiwi. A detailed analysis with a case study is provided in Section 4.4.1. 4.4.1 Translation consistency We present a case study of the En-Zh task from our test set to demonstrate that our system does indeed perform better in terms of translation con- Setting GPT-4o DeepSeek-V3 Cometkiwi LLM-score FC-score Cometkiwi LLM-score FC-score SA.

In this case, the terminology translation of LaTeXTrans remains consistent across the three sections. In contrast, the baseline method finds it difficult to maintain such consistency. This indicates that our system can maintain excellent consistency throughout the entire translation process. 5 Conclusion In this paper, we propose LaTeXTrans, a multi- agent system for translating structured LaTeX doc- uments. LaTeXTrans consists of three collabora- tive modules, each responsible for a specific stage of the translation pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate that LaTeXTrans can outperform base- line systems and offer a reliable solution for LaTeX document translation. 6 Limitations",

LaTeXTrans consists of three collabora- tive modules, each responsible for a specific stage of the translation pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate that LaTeXTrans can outperform base- line systems and offer a reliable solution for LaTeX document translation. 6 Limitations Any instruction-following LLM can be integrated into our LaTeXTrans system. However, due to the large number of available models, it is impractical to evaluate each one individually. Therefore, we select a representative subset of commonly used LLMs for our experiments. We believe this se- lection sufficiently demonstrates the practicality and effectiveness of LaTeXTrans for LaTeX docu- ment translation. Additionally, although commer- cial systems such as Baidu and Youdao offer La- TeX translation services, they are not open-source. As a result, we are unable to compute metrics like COMETkiwi and FC-score for these systems. Therefore, we do not include a comprehensive com- parison with them in our main experiments.

Since the dataset consisted entirely of structured LaTeX documents which exceeded the handling capabilities of single-model systems, we adopted a preprocessing step in the baseline approach. Specifically, the structured LaTeX docu- ments were segmented into section-level translation units to make them manageable for translation. Hyperparameter Setting. In the experiments, we evaluated both open-source and closed-source models separately. For the closed-source models, we accessed them via a third-party API. In the baseline approach, we set the maximum number of new tokens to 16,384 and the temperature to 0.7, while keeping all other hyperparameters at their default values. For our system, the temperature in the Filter was set to 0 with a maximum of 50 new tokens, while all other agents were",
    "baseline approach, we set the maximum number of new tokens to 16,384 and the temperature to 0.7, while keeping all other hyperparameters at their default values. For our system, the temperature in the Filter was set to 0 with a maximum of 50 new tokens, while all other agents were configured with a maximum of 8,192 new tokens; the remaining hyperparameters were kept at their defaults. Evaluation. When computing COMETkiwi and LLM-scores, we used pylatexenc\u2021 to convert each LaTeX translation unit into plain text. Al- though LaTeXTrans parses structured LaTeX doc- uments into fine-grained translation units, we fol- lowed the baseline\u2019s evaluation protocol by using section-level translation units for computing both COMETkiwi and LLM-scores. Furthermore, to assess contextual consistency in the LLM-score evaluation, we concatenated section-level transla- tion units into paired paragraphs and then scored them using GPT-4o. The prompt template used for scoring is illustrated in Figure 12. When calcu- lating the FC-score, we set the initial score S0 to 100. Since errors have a greater impact on the final PDF format scheduling effect than warnings, in the experiment, we set the value of \u03b1 (10) to be sig- nificantly greater than \u03b2 (2). Ultimately, whether the compilation is successful is the most intuitive factor for evaluating the compilation. Therefore, in the experiment, we set the \u03b3 to 20. Datasets We selected the LaTeX source files of 50 academic papers in the field of computer sci- ence from arXiv as our test set. The distribution of paper lengths is shown in Figure 4. Additionally, we analyzed the topics of the papers and visualized them as a word cloud in Figure 5. This result shows \u2021https://github.com/phfaist/pylatexenc that the test set exhibits a diverse range of paper lengths, covering both short and long documents, which helps ensure robustness across different doc- ument sizes. Moreover, the word cloud reveals a wide variety of research topics within the computer science domain, confirming the topical diversity of the test set and enhancing the generality of our evaluation. 2.5k 5k 7.5k 10k 12.5k 15k 17.5k 20k Word Count 0 2 4 6 8 Percentage of Papers (%) Figure 4: Distribution of paper lengths (in word count) in our test set.

We systematically integrate techniques from prior work, such as Clip-Higher and Token-level Loss from DAPO [29], Value-Pretraining and Decoupled-GAE from VC-PPO [30], self-imitation learning from SIL [14], and Group-Sampling from GRPO [22]. Additionally, we further validate their necessity through ablation studies. VAPO is an effective reinforcement learning system that brings together these improvements. These enhance- ments work together smoothly, leading to a combined result that\u2019s better than the sum of the individual parts. We conduct experiments using the Qwen2.5-32B pre-trained model, ensuring no SFT data is introduced in any of the experiments, to maintain comparability with related works (DAPO and DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B). The performance of VAPO improves from vanilla PPO a score of 5 to 60, surpassing the previous SOTA value-model-free methods DAPO [29] by 10 points. More importantly, VAPO is highly stable \u2014 we don\u2019t observe any crashes during training, and the results across multiple runs are consistently similar. 2 Preliminaries This section presents the fundamental concepts and notations that serve as the basis for our proposed algorithm. We first explore the basic framework of representing language generation as a reinforcement learning task. Subsequently, we introduce Proximal Policy Optimization and Generalized Advantage Estimation. 2.1 Modeling Language Generation as Token-Level MDP Reinforcement learning centers around the learning of a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward for an agent as it interacts with an environment. In this study, we cast language generation tasks within the framework of a Markov Decision Process (MDP) [17]. Let the prompt be denoted as x, and the response to this prompt as y. Both x and y can be decomposed into sequences of tokens. For example, the prompt x can be expressed as x = (x0, . . . , xm), where the tokens are drawn from a fixed discrete vocabulary A. We define the token-level MDP as the tuple M = (S, A, P, R, d0, \u03c9). Here",
    "decomposed into sequences of tokens. For example, the prompt x can be expressed as x = (x0, . . . , xm), where the tokens are drawn from a fixed discrete vocabulary A. We define the token-level MDP as the tuple M = (S, A, P, R, d0, \u03c9). Here is a detailed breakdown of each component: \u2022 State Space (S): This space encompasses all possible states formed by the tokens generated up to a given time step. At time step t, the state st is defined as st = (x0, . . . , xm, y0, . . . , yt). \u2022 Action Space (A): It corresponds to the fixed discrete vocabulary, from which tokens are selected during the generation process. \u2022 Dynamics (P): These represent a deterministic transition model between tokens. Given a state st = (x0, . . . , xm, y0, . . . , yt), an action a = yt+1, and the subsequent state st+1 = (x0, . . . , xm, y0, . . . , yt, yt+1), the probability P(st+1|st, a) = 1. \u2022 Termination Condition: The language generation process concludes when the terminal action \u03c9, typically the end-of-sentence token, is executed. \u2022 Reward Function (R(s, a)): This function offers scalar feedback to evaluate the agent\u2019s performance after taking action a in state s. In the context of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) [18, 23], the reward function can be learned from human preferences or defined by a set of rules specific to the task. \u2022 Initial State Distribution (d0): It is a probability distribution over prompts x.

In this equation, H represents the total number of decision steps, s0 is a prompt sampled from the dataset, R(st, at) is the token-level reward obtained from the reward function, \u03b2 is a coefficient that controls the strength of the KL-regularization, and \u03c0ref is the initialization policy. In traditional RLHF and most tasks related to LLMs, the reward is sparse and is only assigned at the terminal action \u03c9, that is, the end-of-sentence token <eos>. 2.3 Proximal Policy Optimization PPO [21] uses a clipped surrogate objective to update the policy. The key idea is to limit the change in the policy during each update step, preventing large policy updates that could lead to instability. Let \u03c0\u03b8(a|s) be the policy parameterized by \u03b8, and \u03c0\u03b8old(a|s) be the old policy from the previous iteration. The surrogate objective function for PPO is defined as: LCLIP (\u03b8) = \u02c6Et h min \u0010 rt(\u03b8) \u02c6At, clip(rt(\u03b8), 1 \u2212\u03f5, 1 + \u03f5) \u02c6At \u0011i (2) where rt(\u03b8) = \u03c0\u03b8(at|st) \u03c0\u03b8old(at|st) is the probability ratio, \u02c6At is the estimated advantage at time step t, and \u03f5 is a hyperparameter that controls the clipping range. Generalized Advantage Estimation [20] is a technique used to estimate the advantage function more accurately in PPO. It combines multiple-step bootstrapping to reduce the variance of the advantage estimates. For a trajectory of length T, the advantage estimate \u02c6At at time step t is computed as: \u02c6At = T \u2212t\u22121 X l=0 (\u03b3\u03bb)l\u03b4t+l (3) where \u03b3 is the discount factor, \u03bb \u2208[0, 1] is the GAE parameter, and \u03b4t = R(st, at) + \u03b3V (st+1) \u2212V (st) is the temporal-difference (TD) error. Here, R(st, at) is the reward at time step t, and V (s) is the value function. Since it is a common practice to use discount factor \u03b3 = 1.0 in RLHF, to simplify our notation, we omit \u03b3 in later sections of this paper. 3 Challenges in Long-CoT RL for Reasoning Tasks Long-CoT tasks present unique challenges to RL training, especially for methods that employ a value model to reduce variance.

    "RL for Reasoning Tasks Long-CoT tasks present unique challenges to RL training, especially for methods that employ a value model to reduce variance. In this section, we systematically analyze the technical issues arising from sequence length dynamics, value function instability, and reward sparsity. 3.1 Value Model Bias over Long Sequences As identified in VC-PPO [30], initializing the value model with a reward model introduces significant initialization bias. This positive bias arises from an objective mismatch between the two models. The reward model is trained to score on the <EOS> token, incentivizing it to assign lower scores to earlier tokens due to their incomplete context. In contrast, the value model estimates the expected cumulative reward for all tokens preceding <EOS> under a given policy. During early training phases, given the backward computation of GAE, there will be a positive bias at every timestep t that accumulates along the trajectory. Another standard practice of using GAE with \u03bb = 0.95 might exacerbates this issue. The reward signal R(sT , <EOS>) at the termination token propagates backward as \u03bbT \u2212tR(sT , <EOS>) to the t-th token. For long sequences where T \u2212t \u226b1, this discounting reduces the effective reward signal to near zero. Consequently, value updates become almost entirely bootstrapped, relying on highly biased estimates that undermine the value model\u2019s role as a reliable variance-reduction baseline. 4 (c) The

Introduction In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been undergoing rapid iteration and evolution (Anthropic, 2024; Google, 2024; OpenAI, 2024a), progressively diminishing the gap towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Recently, post-training has emerged as an important component of the full training pipeline. It has been shown to enhance accuracy on reasoning tasks, align with social values, and adapt to user preferences, all while requiring relatively minimal computational resources against pre-training.

    "towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Recently, post-training has emerged as an important component of the full training pipeline. It has been shown to enhance accuracy on reasoning tasks, align with social values, and adapt to user preferences, all while requiring relatively minimal computational resources against pre-training. In the context of reasoning capabilities, OpenAI\u2019s o1 (OpenAI, 2024b) series models were the first to introduce inference-time scaling by increasing the length of the Chain-of- Thought reasoning process. This approach has achieved significant improvements in various reasoning tasks, such as mathematics, coding, and scientific reasoning. However, the challenge of effective test-time scaling remains an open question for the research community. Several prior works have explored various approaches, including process-based reward models (Lightman et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), reinforcement learning (Kumar et al., 2024), and search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and Beam Search (Feng et al., 2024; Trinh et al., 2024; Xin et al., 2024). However, none of these methods has achieved general reasoning performance comparable to OpenAI\u2019s o1 series models. In this paper, we take the first step toward improving language model reasoning capabilities using pure reinforcement learning (RL). Our goal is to explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure RL process. Specifically, we use DeepSeek-V3-Base as the base model and employ GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning. During training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors. After thousands of RL steps, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits super performance on reasoning benchmarks. For instance, the pass@1 score on AIME 2024 increases from 15.6% to 71.0%, and with majority voting, the score further improves to 86.7%, matching the performance of OpenAI-o1-0912. However, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates a small amount of cold-start data and a multi-stage training pipeline. Specifically, we begin by collecting thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. Following this, we perform reasoning-oriented RL like DeepSeek-R1- Zero. Upon nearing convergence in the RL process, we create new SFT data through rejection sampling on the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data from DeepSeek-V3 in domains such as writing, factual QA, and self-cognition, and then retrain the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. After fine-tuning with the new data, the checkpoint undergoes an additional RL process, taking into account prompts from all scenarios. After these steps, we obtained a checkpoint referred to as DeepSeek-R1, which achieves performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217. We further explore distillation from DeepSeek-R1 to smaller dense models. Using Qwen2.5- 32B (Qwen, 2024b)",

We further explore distillation from DeepSeek-R1 to smaller dense models. Using Qwen2.5- 32B (Qwen, 2024b) as the base model, direct distillation from DeepSeek-R1 outperforms applying RL on it. This demonstrates that the reasoning patterns discovered by larger base models are cru- cial for improving reasoning capabilities. We open-source the distilled Qwen and Llama (Dubey et al., 2024) series. Notably, our distilled 14B model outperforms state-of-the-art open-source QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a) by a large margin, and the distilled 32B and 70B models set a new record on the reasoning benchmarks among dense models. 3 (a) The first part of the English PDF of case 2. 1. \u4ecb\u7ecd \u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u6b63\u5728\u7ecf\u5386\u5feb\u901f\u8fed\u4ee3\u548c\u6f14\u53d8(Anthropic, 2024;

It achieves an impressive length-controlled win-rate of 87.6% on AlpacaEval 2.0 and a win-rate of 92.3% on Are- naHard, showcasing its strong ability to intelligently handle non-exam-oriented queries. Additionally, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates outstanding performance on tasks requiring long-context understanding, substantially outperforming DeepSeek-V3 on long-context benchmarks. 2. Approach 2.1. Overview Previous work has heavily relied on large amounts of supervised data to enhance model performance. In this study, we demonstrate that reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), even without using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start. Furthermore, performance can be further enhanced with the inclusion of a small amount of cold-start data. In the following sections, we present: (1) DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which applies RL directly to the base model without any SFT data, and (2) DeepSeek-R1, which applies RL starting from a checkpoint fine-tuned with thousands of long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples. 3) Distill the reasoning capability from DeepSeek-R1 to small dense models. 2.2.

DeepSeek-R1-Zero: Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model Reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant effectiveness in reasoning tasks, as ev- idenced by our previous works (Shao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023). However, these works heavily depended on supervised data, which are time-intensive to gather. In this section, we explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure reinforcement learning process. We start with a brief overview of our RL algorithm, followed by the presentation of some exciting results, and hope this provides the community with valuable insights. 2.2.1. Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Group Relative Policy Optimization In order to save the training costs of RL, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), which foregoes the critic model that is typically the same size as the policy model, and estimates the baseline from group scores instead. Specifically, for each question \ud835\udc5e, GRPO samples a group of outputs {\ud835\udc5c1, \ud835\udc5c2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc3a} from the old policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc51and then optimizes the policy model \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03by maximizing the following objective: J\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc42(\ud835\udf03) = E[\ud835\udc5e\u223c\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc44), {\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56}\ud835\udc3a \ud835\udc56=1 \u223c\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc51(\ud835\udc42|\ud835\udc5e)] 1 \ud835\udc3a \ud835\udc3a \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc56=1 \u0012 min \u0012 \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56|\ud835\udc5e) \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc51(\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56|\ud835\udc5e) \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc56, clip \u0012 \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56|\ud835\udc5e) \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc51(\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56|\ud835\udc5e) , 1 \u2212\ud835\udf00, 1 + \ud835\udf00 \u0013 \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc56 \u0013 \u2212\ud835\udefdD\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3f \u0000\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03||\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc53 \u0001\u0013 , (1) D\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3f \u0000\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03||\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc53 \u0001 = \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56|\ud835\udc5e) \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56|\ud835\udc5e) \u2212log \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56|\ud835\udc5e) \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56|\ud835\udc5e) \u22121, (2) where \ud835\udf00and \ud835\udefdare hyper-parameters, and \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc56is the advantage, computed using a group of rewards {\ud835\udc5f1, \ud835\udc5f2, . . . , \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc3a} corresponding to the outputs within each group: \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc56= \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\u2212m\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b({\ud835\udc5f1, \ud835\udc5f2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc3a}) s\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc51({\ud835\udc5f1, \ud835\udc5f2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc3a}) .

B. Classical 2D MUSIC Algorithm The MUSIC algorithm is widely used for AoA estimation through eigenvalue decomposition. Based on the model in (9), the covariance matrix of the received signals is given by R = E[Y Y H] = ARssAH + \u03c32I, (10) where Rss = E[SSH] is the correlation matrix of the source signals. The eigenvectors of R associated with the largest D eigenvalues span the signal subspace ES, while the remaining eigenvectors span the noise subspace EN. The 2D MUSIC AoA pseudo-spectrum is defined as PM(\u03b8, \u03d5) = aH(\u03b8, \u03d5)a(\u03b8, \u03d5) aH(\u03b8, \u03d5)ENEH Na(\u03b8, \u03d5) . (11) The angles corresponding to the peaks in this pseudo-spectrum provide estimates of the directions of the incident signals. C. I-SSMUSIC for 3D AoA In contrast to 2D AoA estimation, 3D AoA estimation demands significantly higher computational complexity. More- over, 3D localization tasks are further challenged by the increased severity of multipath propagation. A well-known limitation of subspace-based methods is their degraded per- formance in the presence of correlated sources, primarily due to rank deficiency in the covariance matrix. A notable solution to mitigate this issue is the spatial smoothing technique. We now present an improved MUSIC algorithm with 2D spatial smoothing, referred to as I-SSMUSIC, designed for URAs. Based on (9), the (m1, m2)-th smoothed subarrays of size M1 \u00d7 M2 is formally expressed as Y m1m2 = A1Dm1\u22121 x Dm2\u22121 y \u00b7 S + N m1m2, (12) where Dx = diag[u(\u03b81, \u03d51), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , u(\u03b8L, \u03d5L)], Dy = diag[v(\u03b81, \u03d51), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , v(\u03b8L, \u03d5L)]. (13) Here N m1m2 is the noise matrix at the (m1, m2)-th subar- ray and A1 = [a1(\u03b81, \u03d51) a1(\u03b82, \u03d52) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 a1(\u03b8L, \u03d5L)] is the steering matrix, where each a1(\u03b8l, \u03d5l) is given by a1(\u03b8l, \u03d5l) = ay,M1 (\u03b8l, \u03d5l) \u2297ax,M1 (\u03b8l, \u03d5l) , ax,M1(\u03b8, \u03d5) =",

Using (12), we can reformulate the expression in (10). The covariance matrix of the (m1, m2)-th subarray is therefore given by Rf m1m2 = A1Dm1\u22121 x Dm2\u22121 y Rss \u0000Dm2\u22121 y \u0001H \u00d7 \u0000Dm1\u22121 x \u0001H AH 1 + \u03c32I. (15) In the spatial smoothing scheme, the forward smoothed co- variance matrix Rf is obtained by averaging the covariance matrices of all forward subarrays, yielding Rf = 1 HxHy Hx X m1=1 Hy X m2=1 Rf m1m2 = A1Rf sAH 1 + \u03c32I, (16) where Hx = Mx \u2212M1 +1 and Hy = My \u2212M2 +1. Similarly, we denote the forward-smoothed source covariance matrix by Rf s, which is defined by Rf s = 1 HxHy Hx X m1=1 Hy X m2=1 Dm1\u22121 x Dm2\u22121 y Rss \u00d7 \u0000Dm2\u22121 y \u0001H \u0000Dm1\u22121 x \u0001H . (17) The spatially smoothed covariance matrix enables the appli- cation of eigenstructure-based methods for AoA estimation, even in the presence of coherent signals. One limitation of the spatial smoothing algorithm is its tendency to reduce the effective array aperture, which may degrade sensing performance [17]. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a forward-backward spatial smoothing scheme for URAs, as illustrated in Fig. 6. This bidirectional smoothing approach preserves the aperture size by exploiting the conju- gate symmetry property of the covariance matrix. Mathematically, the forward-backward spatially smoothed covariance matrix is expressed as RX = 1 2 \u0010 Rf + Iv \u0010 Rf\u0011\u2217 Iv \u0011 , (18) where \u0010 Rf\u0011\u2217 is the conjugate for matrix Rf, and Iv = \uf8ee \uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 1 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 1 0 ... ... ... ... 1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 \uf8f9 \uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb M\u00d7M .

    "examining (16) and (18), we observe that the number of forward-only smoothed subarrays, denoted by H, deter- mines the maximum number of resolvable correlated sources, whereas forward-backward smoothing effectively doubles this limit to 2H. In typical indoor environments, where the number of multipath components is usually fewer than five [13], [17], a single forward-backward smoothing operation (H = 2) can decorrelate signals from up to four distinct angles. We now present a comparative evaluation of conventional MUSIC, MUSIC with forward-only spatial smoothing (SS- MUSIC), and the proposed I-SSMUSIC for estimating the an- gles of four correlated signals under identical conditions. The URA consists of 3\u00d74 antennas. Four correlated signal sources emit continuous signals with an SNR of 15 dB, arriving from the following angles: (21.8\u25e6, 90\u25e6), (32\u25e6, 56\u25e6), (15\u25e6, \u221260\u25e6) and (60\u25e6, \u2212150\u25e6), respectively. The spatial spectra are illus- trated in Fig. 7, from which it is evident that the proposed I-SSMUSIC outperforms the other methods. The estimated AoAs using I-SSMUSIC are (21.8\u25e6, 90.8\u25e6), (32.4\u25e6, 57.2\u25e6), (16.4\u25e6, \u221259.6\u25e6) and (60.2\u25e6, \u2212150.6\u25e6), respectively. In com- parison, while SS-MUSIC is capable of estimating correlated signals, it exhibits notably lower resolution. Its estimated AoAs are (22.8\u25e6, 82.2\u25e6), (37.2\u25e6, 50.8\u25e6), (15.2\u25e6, \u221262\u25e6) and (58.8\u25e6, \u2212149.6\u25e6). The standard MUSIC algorithm, by con- trast, fails to resolve the correlated sources, resulting in an ambiguous and inaccurate AoA spectrum. D. Closest Geometric Point Estimation With AoA estimations obtained from multiple URAs dis- tributed across space, the specific location of the signal source can be determined. Ideally, the estimated AoA vectors intersect at the true position of the source. However, due to measure- ment errors, a robust closest-point estimation algorithm is required to approximate the actual point of intersection. The proposed geometric positioning (GP) method first identifies the closest points between each pair of AoAs, as illustrated in Stage 1 of Fig. 8. The final position estimate is then computed as the mean of these closest points. Let li denote the estimated arrival ray associated with the i- th URA. Each ray can be represented by a parametric equation of the form \uf8f1 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f2 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f4 \uf8f3 r1 = c1 + t1d1, ... ri = ci + tidi, ... ru = cu + tudu, (20) where ci \u2208R3 denotes the center of the i-th URA, and di \u2208 R3 is the direction vector of the arrival ray li. To identify the vector th,i = [th ti]\u22a4that best approximates the intersection of the h-th and i-th AoA rays, we solve the following equation \u0014\u2212d\u22a4 h dh d\u22a4 i dh \u2212d\u22a4 h di d\u22a4 i di \u0015 \u0014th ti \u0015 = \u0014(ch \u2212ci) \u00b7 di (ch \u2212ci) \u00b7 dh \u0015",
    "To identify the vector th,i = [th ti]\u22a4that best approximates the intersection of the h-th and i-th AoA rays, we solve the following equation \u0014\u2212d\u22a4 h dh d\u22a4 i dh \u2212d\u22a4 h di d\u22a4 i di \u0015 \u0014th ti \u0015 = \u0014(ch \u2212ci) \u00b7 di (ch \u2212ci) \u00b7 dh \u0015 . (21) If there is no exact intersection, the least-squares solution t\u2217= [t\u2217 h,i t\u2217 i,h]\u22a4determines the pair of closest points on the two rays. The coordinates of these points are given by c\u2217 h,i = ch + t\u2217 h,idh, c\u2217 i,h = ci + t\u2217 i,hdi. (22) Finally, the estimated position of the source based on all u URAs is computed as c\u2217= 1 u(u \u22121) u\u22121 X h=1 u X i=h+1 (c\u2217 h,i + c\u2217 i,h) = [x\u2217, y\u2217, z\u2217]. (23) IV. COLLABORATIVE 3D DIRECT POSITION DETERMINATION For the previously described closest geometric point ap- proach, collaboration is performed at the level of estimated AoAs, as the involved URAs are not synchronized with each other. Given that signal synchronization among ele- ments within each array has now been implemented, a nat- ural question arises: can this synchronization mechanism be further extended to the inter-array level to enable greater cooperative gains? In this section, we develop an inter-array synchronization framework designed to facilitate direct po- sition determination (DPD) [38], [39]. Unlike the preceding closest point estimation method, DPD bypasses intermediate parameter estimation, such as AoA, and instead computes the source position directly in a single step. To reduce the spatial sampling overhead of the proposed DPD algorithm, we first employ the I-SSMUSIC and closest point estimation approaches to define a compact localized space of interest (LSoI). By discretizing the LSoI, we derive a measurement model that characterizes the observation process across multiple synchronized URAs. Synchronization among these arrays is achieved by measuring phase differences rel- ative to a common reference signal. Once synchronization is established, the distributed URAs effectively form a virtual large-scale array, enabling the computation of the MUSIC pseudo-spectrum at the spatial sampling points within the LSoI. To further expand the LSoI and enhance estimation fidelity, we introduce a progressive local traversal strategy. The overall process is illustrated in Fig. 8. For simplicity, the LSoI is configured as a sphere of radius R, centered at the closest geometric point c\u2217estimated via the I-SSMUSIC algorithm.

The AirRoom coarse-to-fine pipeline. The pipeline begins with the Global Feature Extractor, which captures global context features to retrieve the top-5 reference images. Instance segmentation then generates object masks, followed by the Receptive Field Expander, which extracts object patches. The Object Feature Extractor processes both object and patch features. The Object-Aware Scoring module narrows the selection to the top-2 candidates, and Fine-Grained Retrieval identifies the most suitable reference image. However, the high performance of most VPR approaches is largely attributed to large-scale training on VPR-specific datasets [16]. Collecting extensive data for outdoor scenes is relatively straightforward due to",
    "features. The Object-Aware Scoring module narrows the selection to the top-2 candidates, and Fine-Grained Retrieval identifies the most suitable reference image. However, the high performance of most VPR approaches is largely attributed to large-scale training on VPR-specific datasets [16]. Collecting extensive data for outdoor scenes is relatively straightforward due to natural variations in day- light, weather, and seasons. However, such data collection is more challenging in indoor rooms, making large-scale training on indoor datasets difficult and potentially limit- ing their effectiveness. Our approach effectively tackles this challenge by focusing on object-oriented feature represen- tations, allowing us to leverage mature, pre-trained models for object feature learning. This design enables AirRoom to deliver robust performance without requiring any additional training or fine-tuning on specific datasets. 3. Proposed Approach We propose a simple yet highly effective pipeline, Air- Room, for room reidentification that leverages multi-level object-oriented information, as shown in Figure 2. We will now systematically introduce each module of the pipeline, following the sequence of stages in which they are executed. 3.1. Global Stage In this stage, we utilize the Global Feature Extractor to cap- ture global context features, which are derived from the col- lective presence of objects within the room. These features are then used for Global Retrieval, coarsely selecting se- mantically similar candidate rooms from the database. 3.1.1. Global Feature Extractor Indoor rooms exhibit fewer variations compared to out- door environments. They lack diverse topographies, such as aerial, subterranean, or underwater features, and do not ex- perience temporal changes like day-night or seasonal vari- ations. Consequently, collecting large datasets for each in- door room is challenging, complicating large-scale training as seen in many VPR methods [1, 2, 13]. However, indoor rooms are inherently rich in objects, each contributing to the room\u2019s overall semantic context. By leveraging this global context information, we can re- fine the reference search to specifically focus on rooms with similar semantic features to those in the query image. For this purpose, we prefer backbones pretrained on large im- age datasets, as they provide strong generalizability and ef- fectively capture informative global context features [17]. Our model selections, therefore, include pretrained CNN- based models such as ResNet [14] and transformer-based self-supervised models like DINOv2 [25]. 3.1.2. Global Retrieval Using the Global Feature Extractor, we extract global con- text features for M query and N reference images. Let Q \u2208RM\u00d7Dg and R \u2208RN\u00d7Dg denote the query and refer- ence features, respectively, where Dg is the feature dimen- sion. The cosine similarity matrix S is then computed as: Sij = Qi \u00b7 Rj \u2225Qi\u2225\u2225Rj\u2225. (1) For each query, we select the top-5 most similar reference candidates using the following formula: Top5(Si,:) = argsort(\u2212Si,:)[: 5], (2) where Si,: represents",
    "refer- ence features, respectively, where Dg is the feature dimen- sion. The cosine similarity matrix S is then computed as: Sij = Qi \u00b7 Rj \u2225Qi\u2225\u2225Rj\u2225. (1) For each query, we select the top-5 most similar reference candidates using the following formula: Top5(Si,:) = argsort(\u2212Si,:)[: 5], (2) where Si,: represents the cosine similarity for the i-th query. 3.2. Local Stage Global context features provide valuable semantic informa- tion that helps narrow down the candidate list. However, when faced with many semantically similar rooms, rely- ing solely on global context is insufficient, and local fea- tures become increasingly essential. In this stage, we adopt a local perspective by first applying instance segmentation and the Receptive Field Expander to identify objects and patches.

Instance Segmentation For each query image and its corresponding five candidates, we employ instance segmentation methods, such as Mask R-CNN [15] and Semantic-SAM [20], to identify and delin- eate individual objects. This process generates each object\u2019s mask and bounding box. Next, we calculate the center point c of each object using its bounding box, as shown below: c = (x + W 2 , y + H 2 ). (3) In this equation, x and y represent the pixel coordinates of the top-left corner of the bounding box, while W and H de- note the width and height of the bounding box, respectively. 3.2.2. Receptive Field Expander Single object information alone is not sufficiently discrim- inative.

Receptive Field Expander Single object information alone is not sufficiently discrim- inative. For example, although different desks may have distinct appearances, they can be found in both dining halls and offices. However, when an object is connected with its neighboring items\u2014such as a desk alongside a computer, keyboard, or notebook\u2014it suggests that the room is more likely to be an office rather than a dining hall. This insight motivates us to expand the receptive field from a single ob- ject to a patch containing multiple objects. Given the center points of all objects in an image, we em- ploy Delaunay triangulation [6] to generate a triangulated graph of object relationships. Specifically, Delaunay trian- gulation is applied to the set of object centers, ensuring that no object centers are inside the circumcircle of any triangle. This method maximizes the minimum angle of the triangles, preventing narrow, elongated triangles and ensuring more uniform object adjacency. By analyzing the adjacency re- lationships among the resulting triangles, we can construct the object adjacency matrix, which encodes the spatial and relational proximity of objects within the room. Figure 3. The Receptive Field Expander broadens the receptive field from individual objects to patches rich in contextual infor- mation. Leveraging the object adjacency matrix and each object\u2019s bounding box, it expands single objects such as a cupboard, win- dow pane, and chair into object patches like a modular kitchen, multi-pane window, and dining set, respectively. Given the object adjacency matrix and bounding boxes in an image, for each object, we consider the bounding boxes of its neighboring objects and enlarge the current object\u2019s bounding box to encompass all adjacent objects. This ex- pansion increases the receptive field, enabling us to capture richer contextual information, as illustrated in Figure 3. We then apply Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to select the highest confidence bounding boxes, removing overlapping ones based on their Intersection over Union (IoU) scores. This results in a set of clean, informative object patches. 3.2.3. Object-Aware Refinement The Object-Aware Refinement module is composed of three key submodules: Object Feature Extractor, Mutual Nearest Neighbors, and Object-Aware Scoring. Object Feature Extractor To effectively leverage object patches and object segmentation information, we prioritize global features over local feature aggregation. The latter approach may fail to capture object characteristics effec- tively and can significantly increase computational com- plexity and storage demands [49]. As discussed in Sec- tion 3.1.1, we continue to rely on models pre-trained on large image datasets. Using the Object Feature Extractor, we obtain features for both query and reference patches and objects. Let Qp = {pq i }nqp i=1",

Using the Object Feature Extractor, we obtain features for both query and reference patches and objects. Let Qp = {pq i }nqp i=1 and Qo = {oq i }nqo i=1 represent the query patch and object feature sets, respectively. For each reference image among the query\u2019s five candidates, we define the reference patch and object feature sets as Rp = {pr i }nrp i=1 and Ro = {or i }nro i=1. Mutual Nearest Neighbors Given a set of query features {f q i }nq i=1 and reference features {f r i }nr i=1, we obtain fea- ture pairs by identifying mutual nearest neighbor matches through exhaustive comparison of the two sets. Let P de- note the set of cosine similarity scores for these mutual near- est neighbor matches, then we have P = {cos(f q i , f r j ) | i = NNr(f r j ), j = NNq(f q i )} (4) where NNq(f q i ) = arg max j f q i \u00b7 f r j \u2225f q i \u2225\u2225f r j \u2225 ! , (5) NNr(f r i ) = arg max j f r i \u00b7 f q j \u2225f r i \u2225\u2225f q j \u2225 ! , (6) cos(f q i , f r j ) = f q i \u00b7 f r j \u2225f q i \u2225\u2225f r j \u2225. (7) By utilizing mutual nearest neighbors, we can significantly improve retrieval accuracy, simultaneously narrowing the search space and enhancing overall retrieval efficiency [50]. Object-Aware Scoring The object-aware score s is the sum of the global score sglobal (calculated in Equation 1), the patch score spatch, and the object score sobject: s = sglobal + spatch(Qp, Rp) + sobject(Qo, Ro).

Given an in- put image x \u2208RH\u00d7W \u00d73, it is divided into M fixed-size patches, each projected into a patch embedding, resulting in E0 \u2208RM\u00d7dv, where M represents the number of patches and dv the embedding dimension. The initial patch embed- dings E0 are combined with a learnable class token c0 and positional encodings, forming the input sequence for the transformer layers. Each layer processes this sequence as [ci, Ei] = Vi([ci\u22121, Ei\u22121]) i = 1, 2, . . . , L After passing through all transformer layers, a patch pro- jection layer, P c v, projects the output of the class token, cL, into a shared V-L latent space, f = P c v(cL) where f \u2208Rd. Text Encoding: For an input text, e.g., \u201cA photo of a [CLASS].\u201d, it is tokenized and converted into embeddings T0 \u2208RN\u00d7dt, where N is the token length and dt the em- bedding dimension. Beginning-of-text (BOT) and end-of- text (EOT) tokens, denoted b0 and e0, mark the sequence boundaries. These token embeddings, with positional en- codings, are passed through the text encoder\u2019s L trans- former layers, {Wi}L i=1, as follows, [bi, Ti,",

Classification with CLIP: With the image feature f and text features {wc}C c=1 for C classes, CLIP calculates the cosine similarity between f and each wc, sim(f, wc) = f \u00b7 wc |f||wc|, where | \u00b7 | represents the L2 norm. Class probabilities are then computed using the softmax function, p(y = c | f) = exp(sim(f, wc)/\u03c4) PC i=1 exp(sim(f, wi)/\u03c4) where \u03c4 is a temperature parameter. The final predicted class is selected as the one with the highest probability score. 3.2. Multi-Modal Representation Learning (MMRL) Our proposed MMRL aims to address the challenges of adapting pre-trained VLMs using few-shot data while main- taining generalization to new tasks. The training and infer- ence frameworks of MMRL are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, respectively. In the following, we describe the specifics of the methodology. 3.2.1. Learnable Representation Space MMRL establishes a shared, learnable representation space R to facilitate multimodal interactions, initialized through sampling from a Gaussian distribution. Using a learnable mapping function F(\u00b7), implemented as a linear layer, we project the tokens R \u2208RK\u00d7dr in this space\u2014where K is the number of tokens and dr is the dimension of the repre- sentation space\u2014into both visual and textual modalities, Rv = {Rv i }L\u22121 i=J\u22121 Rv i = Fv i (R) Rt = {Rt i}L\u22121 i=J\u22121 Rt i = Ft i (R) where Rv i \u2208RK\u00d7dv and Rt i \u2208RK\u00d7dt represent the rep- resentation tokens for visual and textual modalities, respec- tively, in the (i + 1)-th transformer layer. The index J in- dicates the starting layer from which these representation tokens are integrated into the encoders. 3.2.2. Integration into Higher Encoder Layers To preserve the generalized knowledge in the lower layers of the pre-trained CLIP model, the representation tokens Rv and Rt are integrated into the higher layers of the image encoder V and the text encoder W, beginning from the J-th layer. For the image encoder V, [ci, Ei] = Vi([ci\u22121, Ei\u22121]) i = 1, . . . , J \u22121 [ci, , Ei] = Vi([ci\u22121, Rv i\u22121, Ei\u22121]) i = J, . . . , L \u22121 [ci, Rv i , Ei] = Vi([ci\u22121, Rv i\u22121, Ei\u22121])",
    "from the J-th layer. For the image encoder V, [ci, Ei] = Vi([ci\u22121, Ei\u22121]) i = 1, . . . , J \u22121 [ci, , Ei] = Vi([ci\u22121, Rv i\u22121, Ei\u22121]) i = J, . . . , L \u22121 [ci, Rv i , Ei] = Vi([ci\u22121, Rv i\u22121, Ei\u22121]) i = L For the text encoder W, while previous prompt learn- ing [17] involves replacing parts of Ti to incorporate deep prompts, we retain the entire Ti and insert Rt i before it, aim- ing to preserve the original textual information, [bi, Ti, ei] = Wi([bi\u22121, Ti\u22121, ei\u22121]) i = 1, . . . , J \u22121 [bi, , Ti, ei] = Wi([bi\u22121, Rt i\u22121, Ti\u22121, ei\u22121]) i = J, . . . , L \u22121 [bi, Rt i, Ti, ei] = Wi([bi\u22121, Rt i\u22121, Ti\u22121, ei\u22121]) i = L Note that due to the autoregressive nature of the text en- coder, we adjust the attention mask matrix to accommodate the increased embedding length. 3.2.3. Representation Learning Representation learning is designed to leverage representa- tion tokens for dataset-specific adaptation, while the class token preserves the pre-trained knowledge of the original CLIP. Through a set of strategies aimed at retaining general- ization during both training and inference, MMRL enables flexible inference for different tasks, as detailed below. \u2022 Training Phase: We optimize the features of both the representation tokens and the original class token, with 4 (a) The first part of the English PDF of case 5. 3. \u65b9\u6cd5

MMRL inference process, where different tasks utilize distinct features. the primary focus on representation features to preserve pre-trained knowledge. Specifically, the projection layer for the representation tokens is trainable, while that for the class token remains fixed. For the image encoder V, after passing through L transformer layers, we obtain the output cL \u2208Rdv for the class token and Rv L \u2208RK\u00d7dv for the K representation tokens. The final output of the representation tokens, rL, is derived by averaging across the K tokens, rL = Mean(Rv L) where rL \u2208Rdv. We then apply the patch projection layers to map the outputs of both the class and represen- tation tokens into the common V-L latent space, yielding the class features fc and representation features fr. fc = P c v(cL) fr = P r v (rL) Here, P c v is the original, frozen patch projection layer of CLIP for class features, while P r v for representation fea- tures is trainable. For the text encoder W, following the sequential nature of text, we map the EOT token eL\u2014as in the original CLIP model\u2014after processing through L transformer layers into the common V-L space, yielding the text features. w = Pt(eL) With the image features fc, fr, and the text classifiers {wc}C c=1 for C classes, we apply cross-entropy loss to separately optimize the class and representation features, Lc ce = \u2212 C X c yc log p(y = c | fc) Lr ce = \u2212 C X c yc log p(y = c | fr) where",
    "and the text classifiers {wc}C c=1 for C classes, we apply cross-entropy loss to separately optimize the class and representation features, Lc ce = \u2212 C X c yc log p(y = c | fc) Lr ce = \u2212 C X c yc log p(y = c | fr) where yc = 1 if the image x belongs to class c, and yc = 0 otherwise. To further preserve the generaliza- tion of class features, we maximize the cosine similarity between (fc, w) and the frozen CLIP features (f0, w0), explicitly guiding the training trajectory, Lv cos = 1 \u2212fc \u00b7 f0 |fc||f0| Lt cos = 1 \u22121 C C X c wc \u00b7 wc 0 |wc||wc 0|, The final MMRL loss function is LMMRL = \u03b1Lc ce + (1 \u2212\u03b1)Lr ce + \u03bb(Lv cos + Lt cos) where \u03b1 controls the balance between the features, and \u03bb is the penalty coefficient. \u2022 Testing on Base Classes: For in-distribution classes seen during training, we combine the dataset-specific represen- tation features with the class features that preserve gener- alizability. The probability of an in-distribution test sam- ple x belonging to the c-th class is p(y = c | x) = \u03b1 \u00b7 p(y = c | fc) + (1 \u2212\u03b1) \u00b7 p(y = c | fr) where fc and fr are features extracted from the class to- ken and representation tokens, respectively. \u2022 Testing on Novel Classes: For classes unseen during training or for new datasets, we rely solely on the class tokens, which retain generalized knowledge. p(y = c | x) = p(y = c | fc) 4. Experiments Details on implementation, datasets, and computational cost are provided in the Supplementary Materials. 4.1. Tasks and Datasets We conduct four core evaluations to comprehensively as- sess MMRL\u2019s performance: base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, domain generalization, and few- shot learning. Except for few-shot learning, all experiments utilize a 16-shot setting, i.e., only 16 training examples per category. Base-to-Novel Generalization: In this evaluation, dataset classes are equally divided into base and novel classes. The model is trained exclusively on base classes and tested on both base and novel classes, allowing us to examine its transfer learning effectiveness on base classes as well as its ability to retain the inherent generalization or zero-shot ca- pabilities of pre-trained VLMs for novel classes. We con- duct this evaluation across 11 diverse image classification datasets: ImageNet [7], Caltech101 [9], OxfordPets [32], StanfordCars [19], Flowers102 [29], Food101 [3], FGV- CAircraft [27], SUN397 [45], UCF101 [30], DTD [6], and EuroSAT [11]. 5 (c) The second part of the Chinese PDF of case 5.

    "Comparison between our method and privous SOTA[15]. Figure 1: The comparison of various end-to-end paradigms. (a) The BEV-Centric paradigm. (b) The proposed Sparse-Centric paradigm. (c) Performance and efficiency comparison between (a) and (b). motion prediction and planning should consider the high-order and bidirectional interactions among road agents. However, previous methods typically adopt a sequential design for motion prediction and planning, ignoring the impact of ego vehicle on surrounding agents. (2) Accurate prediction for future trajectories requires semantic information for scene understanding, and geometric information to predict future movement of agents, which is applicable to both motion prediction and planning. While these information are extracted in upstream perception tasks for surrounding agents, it is overlooked for ego vehicle. (3) Both motion prediction and planning are multi-modal problems with inherent uncertainty, but previous methods only predict deterministic trajectory for planning. To this end, we propose SparseDrive, a Sparse-Centric paradigm as shown in Fig. 1b. Specifically, SparseDrive is composed of a symmetric sparse perception module and a parallel motion planner. With the decoupled instance feature and geometric anchor as complete representation of one instance (a dynamic road agent or a static map element), Symmetric Sparse Perception unifies detection, tracking and online mapping tasks with a symmetric model architecture, learning a fully sparse scene representation. In Parallel Motion Planner, a semantic-and-geometric-aware ego instance is first obtained from ego instance initialization module. With the ego instance and surrounding agent instances from sparse perception, motion prediction and planning are conducted simultaneously to get multi-modal trajectories for all road agents. To ensure the rationality and safety for planning, a hierarchical planning selection strategy that incorporating a collision-aware rescore module is applied to select the final planning trajectory from multi-modal trajectory proposals. With above effective designs, SparseDrive unleashes the great potential of end-to-end autonomous driving, as shown in Fig. 1c. Without bells and whistles, our base model, SparseDrive-B, greatly reduces the average L2 error by 19.4% (0.58m vs. 0.72m) and collision rate by 71.4% (0.06% vs. 0.21%). Compared with previous SOTA (state-of-the-art) method UniAD[15], our small model, SparseDrive-S achieves superior performance among all tasks, while running 7.2\u00d7 faster for training (20 h vs. 144 h) and 5.0\u00d7 faster for inference (9.0 FPS vs. 1.8 FPS). The main contribution of our work are summarized as follows: \u2022 We explore the sparse scene representation for end-to-end autonomous driving and propose a Sparse-Centric paradigm named SparseDrive, which unifies multiple tasks with sparse instance representation. \u2022 We revise the great similarity shared between motion prediction and planning, correspondingly leading to a parallel design for motion planner. We further propose a hierarchical planning selection strategy incorporating a collision-aware rescore module to boost the planning performance. \u2022 On the challenging nuScenes[1] benchmark, SparseDrive surpasses",

The temporal decoders have two additional multi-head attention layers: the temporal cross-attention between temporal instances from last frame and current instances, and the self-attention among current instances. In multi-head attention layer, the anchor boxes are transformed into high-dimensional anchor embedding Ed \u2208RNd\u00d7C, and serve as the positional encoding. \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc61 Instance Memory Queue Feature Maps Temporal Propagation Ego Motion Projection Identity Update Deformable Aggregation Feedforward Network Refinement & Classification Cross Attention Self Attention Deformable Aggregation Feedforward Network Refinement & Classification \u00d7 1 \u00d7 5 Key Value Topk Deformable Aggregation Feedforward Network Refinement & Classification Cross Attention Self Attention Deformable Aggregation Feedforward Network Refinement & Classification \u00d7 1 \u00d7 5 Key Value Topk Initialized Map Instances Output Map Instances Initialized Detection Instances Output Detection Instances Figure 3: Model architecture of symmetric sparse perception, which unifies detection, tracking and online mapping in a symmetric structure. Sparse Online Mapping. Online mapping branch shares the same model structure with detection branch except different instance definition. For static map element, the anchor is formulated as a polyline with Np points: \b x0, y0, x1, y1, ..., xNp\u22121, yNp\u22121 . Then all the map elements can be represented by map instance features Fm \u2208RNm\u00d7C and anchor polylines Lm \u2208RNm\u00d7Np\u00d72, where Nm is the number of anchor polylines.

For tracking, we follow the ID assignment process of Sparse4Dv3[33]: once the detection confidence of an instance surpasses a threshold Tthresh, it is locked onto a target and assigned with an ID, which remains unchanged throughout temporal propagation. This tracking strategy does not need any tracking constraints, resulting in an elegant and simple symmetric design for sparse perception module. 3.3 Parallel Motion Planner As shown in Fig. 4, the parallel motion planner consists of three parts: ego instance initialization, spatial-temporal interactions and hierarchical planning selection. Ego Instance Initialization. Similar to surrounding agents, ego vehicle is represented by ego instance feature Fe \u2208R1\u00d7C and ego anchor box Be \u2208R1\u00d711. While ego feature is typically randomly initialized in previous methods, we argue that the ego feature also requires rich semantic and geometric information for planning, similar to motion prediction. However, the instance features of surrounding agents are aggregated from image feature maps I, which is not feasible for ego vehicle, since ego vehicle is in blind area of cameras. Thus we use the smallest feature map of front camera to initialize the ego instance feature: Fe = AveragePool(Ifront,S) (1) There are two advantages in doing so: the smallest feature map has already encoded the semantic context of the driving scene, and the dense feature map serves as a complementary for sparse 5 (c) The second part of the Chinese PDF of case 6.

Prompt Template 1 for Translator You are a professional academic translator specializing in LaTeX-based scientific writing. Your task is to translate long LaTeX texts (including section titles and content) from English to {tgt_language}, while strictly maintaining the integrity of LaTeX syntax. In addition to the LaTeX source, you are provided with: 1. A dynamic summary that condenses the content of all previous sections. 2. A bilingual term dictionary containing domain-specific English\u2013{tgt_language} term pairs. You must use these resources to ensure translation quality: - Use the summary to understand the document context, resolve ambiguous expressions, pronouns, or abstract references, and maintain coherence across sections. - Strictly follow the term dictionary. If an English term in the source appears in the dictionary, you **must** use the corresponding {tgt_language} translation from the dictionary without modification. Please strictly follow the translation requirements below: 1. Only translate the natural language content while keeping all LaTeX commands, environments, references, mathematical expressions, and labels unchanged. 2. Section headings (e.g. natural content enclosed in {} in section identifiers like \\section{}, \\subsection{}, and \\subsubsection{}) must also be translated, but their LaTeX syntax must remain unchanged. 3. Do not translate or modify the following LaTeX elements: Control commands: \\label{}, \\cite{}, \\ref{}, \\textbf{}, \\emph{}, etc. Mathematical environments: $...$, [...], \\begin{equation}...\\end{equation}, etc. Any parameter or argument that includes numerical values with LaTeX layout units such as: em, ex, in, pt, pc, cm, mm, dd, cc, nd, nc, bp, sp.

    "Controllable Conversational Theme Detection Track at DSTC 12 Igor Shalyminov, Hang Su, Jake Vincent, Siffi Singh, Jason Cai, James Gung, Raphael Shu, Saab Mansour Amazon {shalymin,shawnsu,jakevinc,siffis,cjinglun,gungj,zhongzhu,saabm}@amazon.com Abstract Conversational analytics has been on the fore- front of transformation driven by the advances in Speech and Natural Language Processing techniques. Rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the analytics field has taken the problems that can be automated to a new level of complexity and scale. In this paper, we introduce Theme Detection as a critical task in conversational analytics, aimed at automatically identifying and categorizing topics within conversations. This process can significantly reduce the manual effort involved in analyzing expansive dialogs, particularly in domains like customer support or sales. Unlike traditional dialog intent detection, which often relies on a fixed set of intents for downstream system logic, themes are intended as a direct, user-facing summary of the conversation\u2019s core inquiry. This distinction allows for greater flex- ibility in theme surface forms and user-specific customizations. We pose Controllable Conversational Theme Detection problem as a public competition track at Dialog System Technology Challenge (DSTC) 12 \u2014 it is framed as joint cluster- ing and theme labeling of dialog utterances, with the distinctive aspect being controllabil- ity of the resulting theme clusters\u2019 granularity achieved via the provided user preference data. We give an overview of the problem, the asso- ciated dataset and the evaluation metrics, both automatic and human. Finally, we discuss the participant teams\u2019 submissions and provide in- sights from those. The track materials (data and code) are openly available in the GitHub repository. 1 Introduction Conversational analytics \u2014 at the intersection of Speech and Natural Language Processing \u2014 has undergone rapid transformation due to advances in both fields. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) now enables accurate transcription of conversations across diverse domains and durations. Simultane- ously, Natural Language Processing (especially Information Retrieval) has enabled large-scale anal- ysis of conversational data, revealing patterns such as word usage, emotional tone, and discussed top- ics. More recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have elevated the complexity and quality of analy- sis tasks. For instance, large-scale text embedding models (Wang et al., 2024) significantly enhance document similarity search by capturing semantic meaning beyond surface forms. In this paper, we propose the task of Theme De- tection, a key problem in conversational analytics. Themes reflect the high-level topics discussed in conversations and aid in categorizing them by func- tion \u2014 e.g., customer support, sales, or marketing. Automatically identifying and labeling themes can greatly reduce the manual effort required to analyze long conversations. While related to dialog intent detection, theme detection serves a different purpose. Intents are typically tied to a fixed schema and used for down- stream system",
    "tion \u2014 e.g., customer support, sales, or marketing. Automatically identifying and labeling themes can greatly reduce the manual effort required to analyze long conversations. While related to dialog intent detection, theme detection serves a different purpose. Intents are typically tied to a fixed schema and used for down- stream system logic. In contrast, themes are final outputs for users (e.g., analysts), summarizing the customer\u2019s inquiry and supporting diverse surface forms and customizations. We introduce the task of Controllable Conversa- tional Theme Detection as a new track in the Dialog System Technology Challenge (DSTC) 12. Build- ing on the DSTC 11 track on Open Intent Induction (Gung et al., 2023b), our challenge adds two major innovations: (1) joint theme detection and labeling, and (2) controllable theme granularity. The latter enables customization of theme clusters based on user preferences \u2014 motivated by real-world use cases where businesses may want finer or coarser thematic distinctions. This task is designed for a zero-shot setting on unseen domains. Models will be guided by user preference data (detailed in Section 4) to align both labels and cluster granularity. While especially arXiv:2508.18783v1 [cs.CL] 26 Aug 2025 compelling in the context of LLMs, the proposed setup does not require their use. 2 Related Work In this section, we discuss prior work related to the distinctive aspects of our proposed task. 2.1 Unsupervised dialog theme / intent detection The task of open conversational intent induction was introduced in a DSTC 11 track by Gung et al. (2023b), which focused on utterance clustering in two setups of varying complexity: (1) intent de- tection with pre-defined intentful utterances to be clustered, and (2) open intent induction, which re- quired identifying and clustering such utterances. In contrast, our task involves a single setup with pre-defined themed utterances, and the goal is to jointly cluster and label them according to specific evaluation metrics. Unlike intent induction, we do not restrict the surface form of theme labels. Instead, labels are assessed based on their structural quality and functional usefulness for analysis (see Section 6 and Appendix B). 2.2 Controllable clustering Our goal of controllable theme granularity builds on the concept of constrained clustering. A com- prehensive taxonomy of constraint-based cluster- ing tasks is provided by Gonz\u00e1lez-Almagro et al. (2025). We adopt instance-level pairwise con- straints (\u201cshould-link\u201d / \u201ccannot-link\u201d), implement- ing a semi-supervised clustering approach where supervision comes from labeled utterance pairs. This setup has been well-studied, from early work by Basu et al. (2004) to more recent approaches by Zhang et al. (2019) and Viswanathan et al. (2024). 2.3 Clustering with LLMs The use of LLMs for utterance clustering has gained traction. Zhang et al. (2023) propose us- ing hard triplets (\u201cdoes A match",

(2024). 2.3 Clustering with LLMs The use of LLMs for utterance clustering has gained traction. Zhang et al. (2023) propose us- ing hard triplets (\u201cdoes A match B better than C?\u201d) derived from a teacher LLM to fine-tune a smaller embedding model and refine clusters via a hier- archical method similar to HAC (Manning et al., 2008). While this method enables controllable clus- tering guided by LLMs, it focuses solely on clus- tering \u2014 cluster labeling remains out of scope. In contrast, our task requires labeled theme clusters, combining clustering with label generation to better reflect real-world needs. Viswanathan et al. (2024) provide a thorough study on integrating LLMs into clustering work- flows. They identify three points of intervention: (1) pre-clustering, using LLMs to generate key- words and enrich input texts; (2) during cluster- ing, by expanding human-provided pairwise con- straints; and (3) post-clustering, correcting uncer- tain assignments with LLM-based prompting. Al- though their framework aligns well with our goals, their focus remains on clustering rather than label- ing. 3 Task Description The task of Controllable Conversational Theme Detection is defined as follows. The input data are: 1. a dataset of conversations with some utter- ances within them labeled as \u201cthemed\u201d (those conveying the customer\u2019s requests, possibly several per conversation) 2. a set of preference pairs covering a sample of all the themed utterances and representing what pairs should belong to the same theme and which should not. \u2014 which we refer to as \u201cshould-link\u201d and \u201ccannot-link\u201d pairs, respec- tively 3. a theme label writing guideline outlining the requirements to a label as both a linguistic expression and an analytical tool. The goal of the task is to: \u2022 cluster the themed utterances so that each clus- ter represents a meaningful semantic / the- matic group, is distinguishable from other theme clusters and satisfies the should-link / cannot-link requirements on its utterances (if it contains utterances included in the prefer- ence data) \u2022 give each theme a short, concise and action- able natural language label (more detail on our evaluation criteria is given in Section 6). 3.1 Controlling theme granularity In the way we intend to control theme granularity, we loosely follow the Stage 2 approach of Zhang et al. 2023. That work described a data-efficient approach with user preference data in the should- link / cannot-link form. As such, if user preferences indicate that the utterances \u201cI want to purchase pet A: hi how may I help you? C: I want to open a new account A: sure thing! Let me bring up your info ...",
    "with user preference data in the should- link / cannot-link form. As such, if user preferences indicate that the utterances \u201cI want to purchase pet A: hi how may I help you? C: I want to open a new account A: sure thing! Let me bring up your info ... A: hi how may I help you? C: I want to change my PIN A: absolutely! let\u2019s start my pulling up your info ...

The inputs to the \u201csystem\u201d are raw conversations, user preferences on the theme granularity and theme label guidelines; the output is preference- aligned utterance clusters with the corresponding theme labels (marked with \u22c6) insurance\u201d and \u201cI want to purchase travel insur- ance\u201d should belong to the same theme, all the utterances like these two would be associated to the single theme whose label semantically unifies both of the two utterances\u2019 meanings e.g. \u201cpur- chase insurance\u201d or some close paraphrase of it. On the other hand, if the preferences elicit that \u201cI want to find the closest branch\u201d and \u201cGive me the directions to the closest ATM\u201d should not belong to the same theme, the corresponding themes \u201cfind branch\u201d and \u201cfind ATM\u201d as well as the clusters of utterances belonging to them should be kept as sep- arate. Some example usages of such data include contrastive fine-tuning of utterance representation as done by e.g. Chu et al. (2023) and Zhang et al. (2021) or adjusting the initial clusters/themes, as depicted in Figure 1. 3.2 Expected result A successful completion of the task would assume assigning each utterance a theme label so that: \u2022 theme labels are concise, exhaustively cover all the examples and are mutually exclusive, \u2022 label wording conforms to the Theme label writing guideline (Appendix B), \u2022 theme granularity matches the \u2018gold\u2019 held-out assignment which is supposed to be inferred from the provided user preference samples.

A visualization of the overall task is presented in Figure 1 where we depict a potential sequential pipeline as an example. The actual submissions can vary in architecture and the types of models used. We intend the problem to be solved in a zero-shot weakly supervised way, in the sense that all the training/development data provided to the participants has no domain overlap with the test data (more detail on the data in Section 4), and the only supervision signals provided are 1) user preference data covering a sample of the dataset and 2) theme label writing guideline. While the input data suggests LLM-based solu- tions, we encourage the participants to use tech- niques from both LLM-based and traditional Ma- chine Learning paradigms that adequately corre- spond to the problem specifics. 4 Data We build our task on top of the NatCS (Gung et al., 2023a,b), a multi-domain dataset of human-human customer support conversations \u2014 the dataset statistics per domain are provided in Table 2. We intend for the participants\u2019 submissions to work in a zero-shot setup naturally supported within the LLM-centered framework. As such, we provide the three original NatCS domains: Bank- ing, Finance and Insurance \u2014 for the participants to use for the training/development purposes and as- sess the domain generalization of their approaches. Our theme labels closely resemble the original intent annotations in NatCS, though those were altered in the following ways: 1. intent labels\u2019 surface form was rewritten where needed to conform with the theme label writing guideline (see Appendix B), 2. for each original intent label, we provide two theme labels, a more specific one and a more vague one, for the flexibility of evaluation, Table 1: User Preference Data Statistics Domain # Should-link pairs % data covered # Cannot-link pairs % data covered Banking 164 10.04% 164 10.04% Finance 173 10% 173 10% Insurance 155 8.99% 126 7.30% Travel (held out) 77 10.07% 76 9.93% Table 2: Dialog Dataset Statistics Domain # Dialogs # Themed utterances Banking 980 1634 Finance 3000 1725 Insurance 836 1333 Travel (held out) 999 765 3. intent clustering itself was altered to reflect our task\u2019s custom theme granularity, 4. some noisy intent annotations were corrected or otherwise dropped.

    "publicly released for the first time in this challenge and has little to no overlap with the train/dev data. Also introduced in this challenge is theme gran- ularity preference data on top of NatCS dialogs, its statistics are shown in Table 1. We generated preference pairs in the following way. Should-link pairs: we clustered themed utter- ances (we leave the specifics of the clustering algo- rithm behind to prevent evaluation metric hacking) and sampled pairs that belong to the same cluster in the gold assignment but to the different clusters as per the algorithm, with sampling weights set to the normalized cosine distances between the points in the pair (further points that should be in the same theme are more interesting). Cannot-link pairs: similarly, we sampled pairs of utterances that be- long to different clusters in the gold assignment but to the same cluster as per the algorithm. Sam- ple weights set to 1 \u2212dist(utta, uttb) normalized to make a probability distribution, where utta and uttb are the utterances in the pair and dist is cosine distance. In each case, our target amount of pairs to gener- ate corresponds to 10% of all the themed utterances in the dataset, and preference pairs cover no more than 30% of any given gold cluster\u2019s utterances. 5 Baseline and Experimental Setup We provided the participants with a baseline so- lution that combines traditional machine learning approaches with LLM-based techniques. As such, the entire baseline workflow consists of 3 stages: 1. Utterance clustering. Each themed ut- terance is embedded with SentenceBERT (all-mpnet-base-v2 model is used, Reimers and Gurevych 2019), then the em- beddings are clustered using the K-means al- gorithm (Jin and Han, 2010) with 10 clus- ters by default and the k-means++ initial- izer (Arthur and Vassilvitskii, 2007). 2. Theme cluster adjustment to user prefer- ences. We apply a na\u00efve algorithm that re- assigns cluster labels for every utterance id containing in the should-link / cannot-link sets. For every < utti, uttj > pair in the should- link set, if they are assigned to different clus- ters, uttj is re-assigned to utti\u2019s cluster. In turn, for every < uttm, uttn > in the cannot- link set, uttn is re-assigned to the cluster with the second closest centroid to it. Evidently, the baseline cluster adjustment algorithm doesn\u2019t have any generalization outside of the given preference sets. 3. Theme label generation. We used an LLM with the prompt as in Appendix B \u2014 the de- fault model used in the baseline implemen- tation is Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 (Jiang et al., 2023).

No limitation on the num- ber of in-context utterances was set. 6 Evaluation Theme assignment that is the result of our task\u2019s so- lution can be assessed from two perspectives: from the controlled clustering perspective and from the theme label generation perspective \u2014 our evalua- tion metrics reflect these two perspectives. 6.1 Automatic evaluation Automatic evaluation metrics are mainly used for the development purposes and were provided to the participants as part of the starter code.

Normalization is performed over the mean of the entropies of the two assign- ments \u2022 ACC score (Huang et al., 2014) evaluates the optimal alignment between the reference clus- ter assignment and the predicted one, with the alignment obtained using the Hungarian algorithm. 6.1.2 Label generation metrics We evaluate the predicted labels for theme clusters in two general ways: 1) similarity to the reference labels, 2) adherence to the theme label guideline. Similarity of a predicted label to the references is calculated in the following way: Scorei(Yi, \u02c6yi) = max j sim(Yi,j, \u02c6yi) where Yi are the reference labels for the i-th ut- terance (we provide two labels with a more specific and a more vague wording, respectively), yi is the predicted label for the same utterance and sim is one of the similarity functions listed below. \u2022 Cosine similarity \u2014 the semantic simi- larity measure over SentenceBERT embed- dings (all-mpnet-base-v2 model is used, Reimers and Gurevych 2019) of the ref- erence and predicted labels, \u2022 ROUGE score (Lin, 2004) \u2014 an token-level N-gram overlap metric useful for comparing short and",

The model tokenizes each utterance and gener- ates a contextual embedding for each token. Then, a cosine similarity simi,j is calculated between i-th token of the reference and j-th to- ken of the prediction. We report BERTScore Precision (for each token in the prediction, finding the reference token with the highest similarity), Recall (for each token in the ref- erence, finding the prediction token with the highest similarity) and F1 score. Adherence to the guideline is evaluated with an LLM-as-a-Judge prompted with a version of the guideline attached in the Appendix B (it was pro- vided for the participants). For the usage with the LLM, it was split into three sections spanning struc- tural and functional criteria, i.e. how good the label is as a linguistic expression and how good it is as an analytical tool, respectively. For the sake of preventing evaluation metric hacking, we shared a different / condensed version of the guideline to the participants and kept the full version held out. For evaluation during the development phase, our provided code used a self-hosted solution with vicuna-13b-v1.5 (Zheng et al., 2023) as the default LLMaaJ backbone. In the automatic evalu- ation of the final submissions, we used Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic, 2024). Our repository contains both the public version of the label style evaluation prompt (3 condensed sections optimized for usage with public self-hosted LLMs) and its held out ver- sion (2 expanded sections optimized for usage with Claude, uploaded after the end of the competition). 6.2 Human Evaluation All submissions underwent expert human evalua- tion in order to verify automated evaluation results and to expand the automated evaluation methodol- ogy to more precisely assess each solution\u2019s perfor- mance. The evaluation dimensions were divided into two broad categories covering formal and func- tional criteria, and each of these areas had addi- tional subdimensions to be rated by evaluators in a binary fashion (pass/fail) using criteria distributed into into two broad categories: Structural/Func- tional. The structural criteria were based on the theme labeling guidelines provided to participants. Structural Criteria (Theme Label as a Linguistic Expression): Conciseness & Word Choice, Gram- matical Structure Functional Criteria1 (Theme Label as an Analyti- cal Tool): Semantic Relevance, Analytical Utility, Granularity, Actionability, Domain Relevance, The- matic Distinctiveness. The guidelines for each of",
    "were based on the theme labeling guidelines provided to participants. Structural Criteria (Theme Label as a Linguistic Expression): Conciseness & Word Choice, Gram- matical Structure Functional Criteria1 (Theme Label as an Analyti- cal Tool): Semantic Relevance, Analytical Utility, Granularity, Actionability, Domain Relevance, The- matic Distinctiveness. The guidelines for each of these dimensions, along with the positive and negative examples pro- vided to evaluators (with reasoning), are laid out in Appendix C. The theme labeling guidelines, upon which the structural criteria were based, are defined in Appendix B. The annotation task was completed in a single-pass way by two members of the track organizing team. 7 Results and Analysis Table 6: Automatic Evaluation \u2014 Clustering Metrics Team ID ACC NMI Team A 48.37% 42.02% Team B 17.91% 1.97% Team C 67.97% 70.39% Team D 51.76% 47.71% Team E 35.82% 47.73% Team F 26.67% 9.06% Baseline 53.2% 50.59% BL-prefs 47.97% 45.39% We received submissions from 6 participant teams.

Team E trained a reward model from the should-link and cannot-link pairs that was later incorporated into the clustering algorithm to impose soft constraints. Did you use the theme label styleguide \u2014 if yes, how? Team C used General Schema to extract verbs and nouns for each utterance in the cluster, then using those, they generated theme labels. Theme D in- structed the labeling LLM to generate Verb-Object pairs. Teams E and F used the provided styleguide itself.

First, they compute utterance embeddings using either Sen- tence Transformers, InBedder, or Instructor models depending on the embedding type. they then apply clustering (KMeans or HDBSCAN with UMAP- based dimensionality reduction) to group themat- ically similar utterances. Clustering is refined us- ing manually provided should-link and cannot-link preference pairs, ensuring better alignment with human notions of similarity. After clustering, each cluster is labeled automatically by prompting an LLM (ChatGPT or Gemini Flash) with a batch of utterances, extracting a theme label and brief expla- nation. The resulting predicted labels are assigned back to utterances, forming the final output for eval- uation. This approach leverages both unsupervised structure discovery and lightweight LLM-based supervision for scalable and interpretable theme labeling. Team B used SCCL (Zhang et al., 2021) and ap- plied SimCSE for data augmentation. After train- ing the SCCL, they clustered the utterances with K-Means. They performed hyperparameter search for the number of clusters based on the Silhouette score and set it to 7. User preference data was not used. Team C first extracted keyphrases from conversa- tions using an LLM. They also determined the num- bers of clusters based on the Silhouette coefficient. Clustering was performed using ClusterLLM, and the embedder was fine-tuned on the clustered ut- terances. Subsequently, among the two candidates with the highest preference pair accuracy, the can- didate with the greater number of clusters was se- lected as the final model. Utterances were then adjusted according to the preference pairs. Finally, for the clustered utterances, a general schema was extracted in terms of verbs and nouns, and based on both the schema and the utterance content, the final theme labels were generated. Team D explored two approaches. The first one involved designing a prompting strategy to generate concise labels in a Verb\u2013Object for- mat (e.g., \u201cupdate address\u201d, \u201cbook flight\u201d), allowing for more structured and comparable cluster representations. The second approach used LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to evaluate whether two utterances (with dialog history) be- longed to the same cluster, based on their distance from the cluster center. The second method showed limited performance, and they submitted results using the first one, with a more robust prompting- based labeling strategy. Team E propose PrefSegGen, a preference-aware topic segmentation and generation framework that addresses low-resource conversational theme understanding by integrating topical-structured context modeling with user-preference-aligned theme generation. First, they introduce a novel two-stage self-supervised contrastive learn- ing topic segmentation framework to obtain the topic segment to which the target utterance be- longs under low-resource conditions. It ini- tially leverages the unlabeled dialogues to pre- train topic encoders (bert-base-uncased &",
    "integrating topical-structured context modeling with user-preference-aligned theme generation. First, they introduce a novel two-stage self-supervised contrastive learn- ing topic segmentation framework to obtain the topic segment to which the target utterance be- longs under low-resource conditions. It ini- tially leverages the unlabeled dialogues to pre- train topic encoders (bert-base-uncased & sup-simcse-bert-base-uncased) on co- herence and similarity patterns, followed by super- vised fine-tuning with minimal labeled data to en- hance segmentation precision. Subsequently, they incorporate a reward-guided clustering mechanism to guarantee that the generated themes are both contextually grounded and preference-aligned. A reward model, trained on should-link and cannot- link pairs, dynamically assigns linkage weights that reflect semantic proximity in line with user expectations. These weights guide spectral clus- tering after UMAP-based embedding reduction. Crucially, for each target utterance, they utilize its segmented topical context as input when prompt- ing LLaMA3-8B-Instruct, coupled with the official style guide, to generate hierarchical theme labels. An ensemble refinement process further en- hances topic consistency by filtering low-frequency labels, yielding final outputs that are structurally coherent, context-aware, and tailored to user pref- erences. Team F employed a large language model (LLM) to annotate utterances based on preference signals, and subsequently attempted to merge clusters ac- cording to the LLM-based annotation. Our evaluation results reveal that Team C\u2019s ap- proach achieved the highest accuracy across the board on both human and automatic metrics. It was tied with Team B on Label Conciseness, and with Teams A and F on Grammatical Structure. Although only Team C\u2019s approach achieves 100% on both, signifying that its label generation works in full accordance with the styleguide. Team C was also the only one to surpass the baseline on automatic clustering metrics. Team E achieved the second best overall performance in both automatic and human evaluation and Team D placed third. It is noteworthy that for all the three winning places, the ranking induced by the automatic met- rics matched that by the humans \u2014 indicating that 1) automatic similarity metrics are applicable for short text, and 2) automatic evaluation of higher- level concepts like our label guideline is sufficiently accurate with frontier LLMs-as-Judges. 8 Conclusions In this paper, we introduced Theme Detection as a critical task in conversational analytics, and the associated Controllable Conversational Theme De- tection competition track at Dialog System Tech- nology Challenge (DSTC) 12 \u2014 where joint theme clustering and cluster label generation was further combined with the custom theme cluster granular- ity controllable via the provided preference data.

We gave an overview of the competition setup including the problem, the benchmark dataset and the details of evaluation, both automatic and human. We presented the participant team\u2019s submissions and gave an analysis of the insights from those. We hope that this new problem, together with the dataset and the insights obtained from the competi- tion will foster further research and advancements in Conversational AI. 9 Acknowledgements We express our deep gratitude to Dr. Daniel Good- hue for his assistance at the final submission evalu- ation stage.

The theme label should be under 5 words and describe the desired customer's action in the call. <guidance> Output your response in the following way. <theme_label_explanation> Your short step-by-step explanation behind the theme </theme_label_explanation> <theme_label> your theme label </theme_label> </guidance> </task> H: <utterances> {utterances} </utterances> B Theme Label Writing Guideline An acceptable theme label is structurally and se- mantically well-formed according to the rules out- lined in this appendix. Structurally well-formed means that the words and their arrangement in the theme label are acceptable. Semantically well- formed means that the meaning and usability of the theme label are acceptable. B.1 Theme labels exclude unneeded and undesirable words. Theme labels should be concise (2\u20135 words long). They should only include essential words (see B.2 and B.2.1 below). Essential words will primar- ily include content (open-class) words. Function (closed-class) words should be excluded. Prepo- sitions may be included as needed but should be avoided when there is a synonymous alternative label without a preposition. Theme labels should also exclude context- sensitive words like pronouns (him, her, them,",

B.2 Word types \u2022 Content/open-class words: \u2013 nouns (items, insurance, information, or- der, etc.) \u2013 main verbs (check, inquire, add, explore, etc.) \u2013 adjectives (new patient, missing item, etc.) \u2013 other modifying words (shipping infor- mation, product options, etc.) \u2022 Function/closed-class words: \u2013 articles/determiners (the, a, etc.) \u2013 auxiliary verbs (have or be, as in I have eaten or I am eating) \u2013 copulas \u2013 negation (not or -n\u2019t, as in not on time or didn\u2019t arrive) \u2013 conjunctions (and, or, but, etc.) \u2013 complementizers (clause-embedding uses of that, for, if, whether, because, etc.) \u2013 modals (can, could, will, would, may, might, must, shall) \u2013 question words (who, what, where, when, how, why) \u2022 Context-sensitive words: \u2013 pronouns (she, he, they, it, her, his, etc.) \u2013 demonstratives (this, these, that, those, etc.) \u2013 temporal adverbs (yesterday, tomorrow, next week, etc.) \u2013 other context-sensitive language * one, as in I\u2019m looking for a nearby branch. Can you find one? * deleted nouns (noun ellipsis), as in I found his order, but not yours __. B.2.1 Examples For a theme covering order tracking: \u2022 Good: track order \u2022 Good: track shipment \u2022 Bad: track an order (includes an article) \u2022 Bad: track their order (includes a pronoun) For a theme covering finding the nearest branch of a chain: \u2022 Good: find nearest branch \u2022 Good: find closest branch \u2022 Bad: find nearest one (includes context- sensitive one) \u2022 Bad: check if there\u2019s a nearby branch (in- cludes a complementizer if; includes a form of be) B.3 Theme labels are verb phrases that classify events. A verb phrase begins with a verb and may include arguments or modifiers of the verb (such as a direct object). The verb should be in its citation form, lacking any complex morphology such as tense or agreement suffixes. The citation form of a verb is what would normally follow the infinitive to, such as sign up in I\u2019d like to sign up. Theme labels should not be other phrase types, such as noun phrases. The verb phrase should describe a class of events. Events are things that can be said to happen, unlike states (e.g. learn [event] vs. know [state]), entities (e.g. redeem [event] vs. redemption [entity]), prop- erties (e.g. complain [event] vs. angry [property]), and claims (report defect [event] vs. product is defective [claim]).

B.3.1 Examples For a theme covering membership sign-ups: \u2022 Good: sign up for membership (verb phrase; describes a kind of signing up event) \u2022 Bad: signing up for membership (verb phrase, but verb is not in citation form) \u2022 Bad: membership sign-up (noun phrase; de- scribes a kind of entity) \u2022 Bad: memberships (noun phrase; describes a kind of entity) For a theme covering requests to check in early at a hotel: \u2022 Good: request early check-in (verb phrase; describes a kind of requesting event) \u2022 Bad: requested early check-in (verb phrase, but verb is not in citation form) \u2022 Bad: request for early check-in (noun phrase; describes a kind of entity) \u2022 Bad: customer wants early check-in (this is a claim) For a theme covering reporting a defective product: \u2022 Good: report defective product (verb phrase; describes events) \u2022 Bad: reporting defective product (verb phrase, but verb is not in citation form) \u2022 Bad: believe product is defective (verb phrase, but describes a state rather than an event) \u2022 Bad: defective product (noun phrase; de- scribes a kind of entity) B.4 Theme labels are informative and actionable yet sufficiently general. Theme labels should be informative enough to sub- stantially narrow down the set of possible customer issue resolution steps (the steps to resolve the prob- lem/need that drove the customer to make contact). For example, check balance is probably associated with a standard procedure for checking the balance of a range of customer account types, but perform check is so broad that it could be associated with an extremely diverse group of issue resolutions. Non- actionable theme labels may be excessively vague or uninformative, and hence not very useful. B.4.1 Examples For a theme covering appointment-scheduling themes: \u2022 Good: schedule appointments \u2022 Bad: ask about appointments (probably too general) \u2022 Bad: schedule appointment for next week (too specific) \u2022 Bad: schedule appointment for elderly parent (too specific) For a theme covering adding a recognized user to an existing account or policy: \u2022 Good: add user \u2022 Bad: add one (too general) \u2022 Bad: add oldest child (too specific) For a theme covering user password issues: \u2022 Good: reset password \u2022 Good: troubleshoot password \u2022 Bad: secure account (too general) \u2022 Bad: reset password again (too specific) For a theme covering credit or debit card charge disputes: \u2022 Good: dispute charge \u2022 Bad: complain about charge (too general) \u2022 Bad: file card complaint",
    "user password issues: \u2022 Good: reset password \u2022 Good: troubleshoot password \u2022 Bad: secure account (too general) \u2022 Bad: reset password again (too specific) For a theme covering credit or debit card charge disputes: \u2022 Good: dispute charge \u2022 Bad: complain about charge (too general) \u2022 Bad: file card complaint (too general) \u2022 Bad: dispute charge for defective blender (too specific) C Human Evaluation Guidelines C.1 Structural Dimensions C.1.1 Conciseness & Word Choice Options: Pass (1) / Fail (0) Definition: The following criteria are consolidated by the evaluator into one Pass/Fail rating for Con- ciseness & Word Choice: 1. Label length: Is the label concise, containing only 2\u20135 words? \u2022 Pass: update billing address Fail: update customer\u2019s residential billing address for future statements Rationale: The good example uses 3 words, within the required 2-5 word range. The bad example uses 8, making it unnecessarily verbose when the core intent can be expressed more concisely. \u2022 Pass: access account statement Fail: statement Rationale: The good example uses 3 words, adhering to the 2-5 word guide- line. The bad example uses only one word, which lacks sufficient specificity to be useful as a theme label. 2. Function word exclusion: Does the label exclude unnecessary function words (articles, auxiliary verbs, etc.)? \u2022 Pass: add dependent coverage Fail: add the dependent to coverage Rationale: The good example correctly excludes function words like articles (\u201cthe\u201d), focusing only on essential con- tent words. The bad example unneces- sarily includes \u201cthe\u201d, which should be excluded according to guidelines. \u2022 Pass: troubleshoot internet connection Fail: troubleshoot why internet is not working Rationale: The good example prop- erly excludes function words, while the bad example improperly includes func- tion words \u201cwhy,\u201d \u201cis,\u201d and \u201cnot\u201d which should be excluded for conciseness. 3. Avoidance of context sensitivity: Does the label exclude context-dependent words (pronouns, demonstratives, temporal adverbs, etc.)? \u2022 Pass: return defective product Fail: return this item Rationale: The good example avoids context-sensitive words like \u201cthis\u201d and uses the general term \u201cproduct\u201d that can apply across contexts. The bad exam- ple includes the context-sensitive demon- strative \u201cthis,\u201d which requires a specific context to understand its meaning. \u2022 Pass: reschedule appointment Fail: reschedule it for tomorrow Rationale: The good example uses gen- eral terminology applicable to any ap- pointment, while the bad example in- cludes both the pronoun \u201cit\u201d and the tem- poral adverb \u201ctomorrow,\u201d both of which are dependent on conversation context for their meaning. 4. Preposition usage: Are prepositions included only when necessary? \u2022 Pass: transfer funds Fail: transfer from account Rationale: The good example avoids un- necessary prepositions by using a con- cise verb-object structure. The bad ex- ample unnecessarily includes the prepo- sition \u201cfrom\u201d when the more concise",
    "context for their meaning. 4. Preposition usage: Are prepositions included only when necessary? \u2022 Pass: transfer funds Fail: transfer from account Rationale: The good example avoids un- necessary prepositions by using a con- cise verb-object structure. The bad ex- ample unnecessarily includes the prepo- sition \u201cfrom\u201d when the more concise al- ternative without the preposition works just as well. \u2022 Pass: join rewards program Fail: sign up for rewards program Rationale: The good example avoids prepositions entirely, while the bad ex- ample unnecessarily includes the prepo- sition \u201cfor\u201d when alternatives without prepositions are available and equally clear. C.1.2 Grammatical Structure Options: Pass (1) / Fail (0) Definition: The following criteria are consolidated by the evaluator into one Pass/Fail rating for Gram- matical Structure: 1. Verb phrase structure: Is the label a verb phrase? \u2022 Pass: cancel flight Fail: flight cancellation Rationale: The good example correctly follows the verb phrase requirement by starting with a verb (\u201ccancel\u201d) followed by a noun (\u201cflight\u201d). The bad example uses a noun phrase (\u201cflight cancellation\u201d) instead. \u2022 Pass: redeem rewards Fail: rewards redemption process Rationale: The good example uses a verb phrase beginning with the verb \u201cre- deem\u201d. The bad example fails by using a noun phrase with \u201credemption\u201d as the head noun rather than using a verb form. 2. Citation form: Does the verb appear in its ci- tation form (without tense or agreement mor- phology)? \u2022 Pass: change delivery address Fail: changing delivery address Rationale: The good example cor- rectly uses the citation form of the verb \u201cchange\u201d without any tense or agreement morphology. The bad example fails by using the -ing form \u201cchanging\u201d rather than the required base form. \u2022 Pass: cancel subscription Fail: canceled subscription Rationale: The good example properly uses the citation form of the verb \u201ccancel\u201d without inflectional endings. The bad example incorrectly uses the past tense form \u201ccancelled\u201d instead of the citation form. 3. Event classification: Does the verb phrase describe a class of events, rather than states, entities, properties, or claims? \u2022 Pass: verify warranty coverage Fail: warranty coverage Rationale: The good example describes an event (the act of verifying) rather than an entity. The bad example describes an entity (the warranty coverage itself) rather than an event, violating the require- ment that theme labels classify events. Note: The bad example would also be ruled out by the verb phrase requirement. \u2022 Pass: express dissatisfaction Fail: customer is dissatisfied Fail: is dissatisfied Rationale: The good example describes an event (the act of expressing) rather than a state. The first bad example is structured as a claim about the customer, rather than describing en event. The sec- ond bad example is a verb phrase but describes the wrong",
    "is dissatisfied Fail: is dissatisfied Rationale: The good example describes an event (the act of expressing) rather than a state. The first bad example is structured as a claim about the customer, rather than describing en event. The sec- ond bad example is a verb phrase but describes the wrong kind of situation: a state, rather than an event. \u2022 Pass: complain about faulty product (event) Fail: angry about faulty product (prop- erty) Rationale: The good example describes an event (the act of complaining) rather than a property. The bad example de- scribes a property or attribute of the cus- tomer, rather than an event describing the customer\u2019s intent. C.2 Functional Dimensions C.2.1 Semantic Relevance Options: Pass (1) / Fail (0) Definition: Does the label accurately capture the core intent/topic of the utterance it represents? Theme labels are expected to provide a gist of the dialogue from the customer\u2019s inquiry perspective. \u2022 Pass: request card security support (For cus- tomer utterance: \u201cI received a notification that my credit card might have been compromised. I need to know what steps I should take.\u201d) Rationale: This theme label demonstrates good semantic relevance by accurately cap- turing the core intent of the customer\u2019s in- quiry\u2014addressing a potential security is- sue\u2014rather than focusing on peripheral as- pects like the notification itself. \u2022 Fail: express frustration (For customer utter- ance: \u201cI\u2019ve been on hold for 45 minutes trying to get help with activating my new debit card. This is ridiculous!\u201d) Rationale: This theme label fails the seman- tic relevance test because it focuses on the customer\u2019s emotional state rather than their actual intent, which is to activate their debit card. The frustration is secondary to the core purpose of the contact. \u2022 Pass: book accommodation Fail: inquire about Chicago Rationale: The good example correctly iden- tifies the core intent (booking a hotel room), while the bad example misidentifies the intent as seeking information about Chicago when the location is just a detail/slot related to the booking request. C.2.2 Analytical Utility Options: Pass (1) / Fail (0) Definition: Does the label provide meaningful cat- egorization that could directly support a reviewer or analyst\u2019s workflow when reviewing conversation data? Themes, which should be ready for presenta- tion to the user/analyst, are supposed to highlight the topics discussed in the conversation that are useful for categorizing and further analyzing them according to the nature of the conversation. \u2022 Pass: troubleshoot checkout error For customer utterance: \u201cI\u2019m getting error code E-503 when trying to complete my pur- chase on your website. I\u2019ve tried three differ- ent browsers.\u201d Rationale: This theme label has good analyti- cal utility because it categorizes the issue in a way that would allow analysts to,",
    "Pass: troubleshoot checkout error For customer utterance: \u201cI\u2019m getting error code E-503 when trying to complete my pur- chase on your website. I\u2019ve tried three differ- ent browsers.\u201d Rationale: This theme label has good analyti- cal utility because it categorizes the issue in a way that would allow analysts to, e.g., identify patterns in checkout problems, prioritize tech- nical fixes, and track the frequency of specific error types. \u2022 Fail: customer contact For customer utterance: \u201cI ordered a blue shirt in size medium last week, but you sent me a red one instead. I\u2019d like to exchange it.\u201d Rationale: This theme label lacks analyti- cal utility because it\u2019s too broad to provide meaningful categorization. It fails to identify the specific issue (there\u2019s an order fulfillment error) in a way that could help improve opera- tions or track problem patterns. \u2022 Pass: downgrade service plan Fail: smart thermostat model TH8000 connec- tion failure with iOS app version 3.2.1 Rationale: The good example provides use- ful categorization at the right level of detail for business analysis. The bad example is too specific with technical details that would fragment similar issues into tiny categories, making pattern identification difficult. C.2.3 Granularity Options: Pass (1) / Fail (0) Definition: Does the label maintain appropriate specificity, as determined by its closeness to the provided gold labels? (Submission authors are ex- pected to infer ideal granularity from the provided user preference data.) \u2022 Pass: update payment information Fail: manage account Rationale: The good example demonstrates appropriate granularity by categorizing the issue at a level that\u2019s neither too broad nor too specific. The bad example is too broad, grouping potentially diverse issues that would benefit from more specific categorization. \u2022 Pass: troubleshoot device connectivity Fail: resolve Sony WH-1000XM4 head- phones pairing failure with streaming app on Android 16 beta Rationale: The good example shows appro- priate granularity by categorizing at a level that groups similar technical problems. The bad example has excessive granularity, in- cluding specific device models and OS ver- sions that would create overly-fragmented cat- egories. C.2.4 Actionability Options: Pass (1) / Fail (0) Definition: Does the label provide sufficient in- formation to categorize customer issues for resolu- tion? Theme labels should be informative enough to substantially narrow down the set of possible customer issue resolution steps. \u2022 Pass: dispute transaction Fail: seek assistance Rationale: The good example demonstrates good actionability by clearly identifying a spe- cific process (transaction dispute) with estab- lished resolution procedures. The bad exam- ple is too vague to suggest any specific resolu- tion path. \u2022 Pass: trace missing shipment Fail: discuss app features Rationale: The good example shows good actionability by identifying a specific issue (shipment tracking problem) that points to",
    "cific process (transaction dispute) with estab- lished resolution procedures. The bad exam- ple is too vague to suggest any specific resolu- tion path. \u2022 Pass: trace missing shipment Fail: discuss app features Rationale: The good example shows good actionability by identifying a specific issue (shipment tracking problem) that points to clear resolution steps. The bad example has poor actionability because \u201cdiscuss\u201d doesn\u2019t point to a specific resolution-related action, and \u201capp features\u201d is too broad. C.2.5 Domain Relevance Options: Pass (1) / Fail (0) Definition: Does the label reflect domain-specific terminology and concepts appropriate to the con- versation context? Theme labels should reduce manual analysis by utilizing domain-relevant and context-relevant terminology. \u2022 Pass: verify coverage details For customer utterance: \u201cI need to know if my insurance policy covers damage from a burst pipe in my basement.\u201d Rationale: This theme label demonstrates good domain relevance by using terminology (\u201cverify coverage\u201d) that\u2019s specific to the in- surance industry and reflects how claims and policy questions are typically categorized in that domain. \u2022 Pass: transfer prescription For customer utterance: \u201cI want to trans- fer my prescription from my old pharmacy to your location. Can you help with that?\u201d Rationale: This theme label shows good do- main relevance by using standard pharmacy industry terminology (\u201ctransfer prescription\u201d) that accurately reflects how this process is categorized and handled within the health- care/pharmacy domain. \u2022 Fail: change money amount For customer utterance: \u201cI need to increase my 401(k) contribution percentage starting with my next paycheck.\u201d Rationale: This theme label lacks domain rel- evance because it uses overly-generic termi- nology instead of financial industry-specific language. A more domain-relevant label would be \u201cadjust retirement contribution\u201d or \u201cmodify investment allocation.\u201d \u2022 Fail: fix travel problem For customer utterance: \u201cMy flight was de- layed and I missed my connection. I need to be rebooked on the next available flight.\u201d) Rationale: This theme label has poor domain relevance because it doesn\u2019t use airline in- dustry terminology. A more domain-relevant label would be \u201crebook missed connection\u201d, \u201caccommodate disrupted itinerary\u201d, etc. C.2.6 Thematic Distinctiveness Options: Pass (1) / Fail (0) Definition: Does the label create a clear boundary that differentiates one theme from the other themes in the dataset? Theme labels should exhaustively cover all the examples AND be mutually exclusive. \u2022 Pass: report stolen card In this context: Dataset already contains theme labels \u201creport lost card\u201d and \u201creport fraudulent transaction\u201d For customer utterance: \u201cSomeone stole my wallet and I need to block my credit card im- mediately.\u201d Rationale: This theme label demonstrates good thematic distinctiveness by creating a clear boundary between related but distinct is- sues: lost cards (misplaced by owner), stolen cards (taken by someone else), and fraudulent transactions (unauthorized use).\u2019 \u2022 Fail:",
    "stole my wallet and I need to block my credit card im- mediately.\u201d Rationale: This theme label demonstrates good thematic distinctiveness by creating a clear boundary between related but distinct is- sues: lost cards (misplaced by owner), stolen cards (taken by someone else), and fraudulent transactions (unauthorized use).\u2019 \u2022 Fail: inquire about refund In this context: Dataset already contains theme label \u201crequest refund\u201d For customer utterance: \u201cI returned my pur- chase last week but haven\u2019t seen the money back in my account yet.\u201d Rationale: This theme label fails the thematic distinctiveness test because it doesn\u2019t create a clear boundary between refund requests and refund status checks. The new utterance is about tracking a refund in progress, which should be a distinct category (e.g. \u201ccheck re- fund status\u201d. Instead, this category could be compatible with utterances that are already covered by \u201crequest refund\u201d. \u2022 Pass: change delivery location Fail: reset account In this context: Dataset already contains theme labels \u201cschedule delivery\u201d, \u201cresched- ule delivery\u201d, \u201creset password\u201d, and \u201cupdate account information\u201d Rationale: The good example shows appro- priate thematic distinctiveness by creating a clear boundary between different delivery modification types. The bad example blurs the boundary between password resets and other profile updates, creating confusion about cate- gorization.

    "Harnessing Rule-Based Reinforcement Learning for Enhanced Grammatical Error Correction Yilin Li1, Xunjian Yin1, Yilin Chen2, Xiaojun Wan1* 1Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology, Peking University 2School of Computer Science & Key Lab of High Confidence Software Technologies (MOE), Peking University liyilin25@stu.pku.edu.cn Abstract Grammatical error correction is a significant task in NLP. Traditional methods based on encoder-decoder models have achieved certain success, but the application of LLMs in this field is still underexplored. Current research predominantly relies on supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs to directly gen- erate the corrected sentence, which limits the model\u2019s power- ful reasoning ability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework based on Rule-Based RL. Through exper- iments on the Chinese datasets, our Rule-Based RL frame- work achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a notable increase in recall. This result clearly highlights the advan- tages of using RL to steer LLMs, offering a more controllable and reliable paradigm for future development in GEC. Introduction Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) (Bryant et al. 2023) is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) focused on the automatic detection and correction of gram- matical errors in text. This task is essential not only for im- proving text quality but also for supporting applications such as language learning and automated writing evaluation. Over the years, numerous models have been developed to address GEC, including the Transformer model (Junczys-Dowmunt et al. 2018), BERT (Kaneko et al. 2020), and T5 (Rothe et al. 2021). Qorib, Na, and Ng (2022) combines these models and generates better corrections. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has markedly advanced the field of NLP. Models such as GPT and LLaMA(OpenAI et al. 2024a; Grattafiori et al. 2024) have demonstrated remarkable performance and potential in various NLP tasks, attributable to their ability to discern complex syntactic, semantic, and contextual patterns. Con- siderable research has investigated the potential of LLMs in GEC. Fang et al. (2023) and Loem et al. (2023) have exam- ined the performance of large language models in the GEC task, demonstrating that LLMs possess strong capabilities in capturing syntactic and semantic nuances. However, initial studies suggest that these LLMs struggle to surpass traditional Seq2Seq models on the GEC task(Qu, Tang, and Wu 2025; Zhang et al. 2023; Yang and Quan 2024). One prominent issue is overcorrection, where gram- matically correct text segments are unnecessarily modified, *Corresponding author.

    "Figure 1: Traditional Seq2Seq and transformer-based mod- els with supervised learning in GEC task prioritize precision, making fewer corrections to sentence structure. In contrast, LLMs emphasize grammar and fluency, leading to deeper corrections but often causing over-correction. thereby compromising the integrity of the original sentence. As shown in Figure 1, traditional methods with supervised learning can carefully ensure consistency in the form of in- put and output text but often lead to missed error correc- tions, whereas large models tend to ambitiously overcorrect to make sentences fluent. Simple prompting techniques fail to ensure that LLMs remain faithful to the original text, lead- ing to a trade-off between fluency and structural fidelity(Sun and Wang 2022). Table 1 provides an example of overcorrection, highlight- ing how an LLM introduces unnecessary modifications to a sentence. The prevailing strategy among researchers is to treat LLMs as generative models, employing Supervised Fine- Tuning (SFT) to enable them to produce corrected sen- tences directly. However, this approach may not fully har- ness the inherent reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Efforts to integrate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into LLMs for GEC have been explored, yet these often lead to issues such as hallucinations, deviations from task instructions, and a heightened risk of overcorrection. According to Fang et al. (2023), CoT has proven less effective, possibly due to the arXiv:2508.18780v1 [cs.CL] 26 Aug 2025 Description Sentence Source Sentence My advice to any one start learn this sport to become carefully... One Possible Standard Answer. My advice to anyone starting learning this sport is to become careful... LLM My advice to anyone who is starting to learn this sport is to be careful... Table 1: An example demonstrating the overcorrection by large language models shows that when faced with a sentence with grammatical error, LLMs make unnecessary adjustments to the original sentence for issues like fluency. This may even bring the risk of changing the meaning of the sentence. insufficient reasoning capacity of LLMs to address the in- tricacies of GEC. Simply embedding reasoning techniques like CoT does not mitigate these shortcomings, as even the most advanced models\u2014both open-source and propri- etary\u2014struggle to identify errors in challenging sentences. Recent developments, such as the introduction of Ope- nAI\u2019s O1(OpenAI et al. 2024b) and DeepSeek\u2019s R1(Guo et al. 2025), have bolstered the reasoning abilities of LLMs. Simultaneously, research interest in long reasoning and rule- based reward mechanisms within reinforcement learning has surged.

The contributions of this paper are as follows: \u2022 We leverage LLMs as reasoners for GEC, marking the first exploration of models with enhanced reasoning ca- pabilities in this context. \u2022 We apply reinforcement learning to GEC by designing a rule-based reward function specifically designed for Grammatical Error Correction. \u2022 We develop a Chinese GEC model using this methodol- ogy, which surpasses existing baselines on the FCGEC dataset, delivering more accurate and interpretable cor- rections. Additionally, we have made the code and train dataset generated by DeepSeek R1 publicly available. Related Work Traditional GEC Methods Traditional GEC methods can be divided into two categories: Sequence-to-Edit(Seq2Edit) and Sequence-to- Sequence (Seq2Seq). Seq2Seq Early work primarily focuses on sequence-to- sequence models (Junczys-Dowmunt et al. 2018), which treats GEC as a translation task, translating erroneous sen- tences into corrected ones. Enhancements such as data syn- thesis and advanced reranking strategies have further im- proved these models (Stahlberg and Kumar 2021; Lichtarge, Alberti, and Kumar 2020) More advanced Seq2Seq ap- proaches use Transformer-based models. Transformer-based models have played a crucial role in recent develop- ments, leveraging architectures like BERT, BART and T5 (Tarnavskyi, Chernodub, and Omelianchuk 2022; Lewis et al. 2019; Raffel et al. 2019), which excel at handling long dependencies. These models have been fine-tuned on GEC-specific datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results. Pre-training strategies and large-scale unsupervised data have been instrumental in this improvement (Grundkiewicz, Junczys-Dowmunt, and Heafield 2019). Seq2Edit The Seq2Edit approach frames GEC as a se- quence labeling task by predicting the appropriate edit op- eration for each token. Models like GECToR (Omelianchuk et al. 2020), have since gained prominence, introducing an efficient token-level correction process that tags errors in- stead of rewriting entire sentences. This model reduces in- ference time while maintaining high accuracy, particularly in low-resource settings (Stahlberg and Kumar 2020). LLMs for GEC LLMs such as GPT-3 and GPT-4 have been employed for GEC (Fang et al. 2023), although they face challenges re- lated to over-correction. Recent studies indicate that these models perform well when guided with in-context examples (Tang, Qu, and Wu 2024). Tang, Qu, and Wu (2024) uses syntactic information to select in-context examples. In another line, some research have explored other roles of LLMs in the GEC task, such as generating explanations for corrections, data augmentation(Li et al. 2024; Song et al. 2024; Wang et al.",

In another line, some research have explored other roles of LLMs in the GEC task, such as generating explanations for corrections, data augmentation(Li et al. 2024; Song et al. 2024; Wang et al. 2024b) and assessing the quality of gram- matical edits(Xie et al. 2025a). LLM Reasoning with Post-training. Previous work has primarily relied on supervised fine-tuning with carefully curated datasets to enhance LLM perfor- mance in complex tasks like reasoning or tool use (Schick et al. 2023; Qin et al. 2024; Gou et al. 2024). Recently, reinforcement learning has gained traction as a more scal- able and generalizable training paradigm. The development of RL methods for LLMs has evolved from reinforce- ment learning from human feedback (RLHF) (Kaufmann et al. 2023) and proximal policy optimization (PPO) (Schul- man et al. 2017) to more advanced techniques such as di- rect preference optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al. 2023), SimPO (Meng, Xia, and Chen 2024), and group relative pol- icy optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al. 2024). Among these, GRPO (Shao et al. 2024) is specifically designed for LLMs, replacing the traditional critic with a group-based evaluation strategy. It has shown strong per- formance in enhancing reasoning abilities across a range of tasks, including mathematical problem solving (Shao et al. 2024; Xie et al. 2025b), search engine interaction (Jin et al. 2025; Song et al. 2025), and code generation (Li, Zou, and Liu 2025). A pivotal application of this algo- rithm was demonstrated by the open-source community with DeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al. 2025), which showed that large- scale pure RL guided only by simple rule-based rewards (i.e., formatting rules and final answer correctness) can mo- tivate LLMs to develop self-emergent reasoning processes. This \u201dR1-Zero\u201d paradigm has been successfully replicated and extended to other domains, including logic games (Xie et al. 2025b) and vision reasoning (Huang et al. 2025). The flexibility of GRPO\u2019s reward function has also been lever- aged for diverse objectives, such as assigning weights to sub- tasks (Yu et al. 2024) or constraining tool use frequency (Li, Zou, and Liu 2025). In this work, we build upon the established success of the GRPO algorithm and extend its application to GEC. Similarities between Grammatical Error Correction and Math Reasoning Tasks Grammatical Error Correction can be viewed as a complex reasoning task, sharing significant parallels with mathemati- cal reasoning due to its reliance on multi-level rule compre- hension and structured thought processes. First, both GEC and mathematical reasoning demand a deep understanding of underlying rules. Just as math relies on precise laws and logic, GEC requires applying grammat- ical principles (e.g., subject-verb agreement, tense consis- tency,",
    "mathemati- cal reasoning due to its reliance on multi-level rule compre- hension and structured thought processes. First, both GEC and mathematical reasoning demand a deep understanding of underlying rules. Just as math relies on precise laws and logic, GEC requires applying grammat- ical principles (e.g., subject-verb agreement, tense consis- tency, word usage) to identify and correct errors. This shared need for rule adherence is a key similarity. Second, both tasks require a structured, step-by-step rea- soning process. Mathematics often involves decomposing complex problems and solving them incrementally. Simi- larly, GEC involves analyzing sentences, identifying errors, and deducing corrections systematically, especially for mul- tiple errors within a sentence, much like stepwise mathemat- ical problem-solving. Third, both GEC and math reasoning operate with clear objectives and evaluation criteria. Math aims for accurate, logically sound solutions. GEC seeks to produce grammati- cally correct and natural sentences, so we can compare out- puts with the correct sentences by means of string compari- son, and then give reward scores. Therefore, viewing GEC as a complex reasoning task clar- ifies its underlying logic and suggests new paths for im- provement. This perspective allows for adapting systematic problem-solving approaches from mathematics to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of GEC. Our Methodology This section details our methodology, which trains a GEC model through a two-stage process: an initial SFT phase fol- lowed by a reinforcement learning RL phase. We design a rule-based reward function specifically for the GEC task. This function integrates two key signals: a reward for ad- hering to the correct reasoning format and a reward for the final answer\u2019s correctness. We use this composite reward to train the model with the GRPO algorithm (Shao et al. 2024), which ensures stable and efficient RL training.

Following previous work (Zhang et al. 2022), our Super- vised Fine-Tuning process is divided into two stages, with the corresponding datasets detailed in Table 2. For SFT-stage 1, we adopt the data preparation methodology from Zhang et al. (2022). Specifically, all error-free samples are dis- carded from the Lang8 and HSK datasets. The HSK dataset is then replicated five times and combined with the Lang8 dataset, yielding a total of 1,568,885 sentence pairs. To cre- ate the data for SFT-stage 2, we use the FCGEC training set.

The HSK dataset is then replicated five times and combined with the Lang8 dataset, yielding a total of 1,568,885 sentence pairs. To cre- ate the data for SFT-stage 2, we use the FCGEC training set. The full procedure is detailed in Algorithm 1. We leverage Qwen-32B and DeepSeek-R1 to perform in- ference on the SFT-stage 1 and SFT-stage 2 datasets, respec- tively, to generate a new corpus containing detailed reason- ing traces. Subsequently, we employ DeepSeek-V3 to per- form quality filtering on the data generated for SFT-stage 2. The objective of this filtering is to select instances where the reasoning path correctly identifies whether a sentence needs correction and whether the proposed edit is accurate. The prompts used for generate detailed reasoning traces and the filtering process are detailed in the Appendix. Instances that fail this initial check are then re-generated using R1 in a sec- ond generation pass. This refined data is filtered again. After this filtering and refinement process, we ultimately obtained 27,501 high-quality, reasoning-augmented GEC training in- stances. Meanwhile, the original FCGEC training set is re- tained for the RL stage. Rule-Based Reward In RL, the reward is the main signal that drives model train- ing. DeepSeek-R1-Zero (Guo et al. 2025) employs simple rule-based rewards that check whether the final answer is correct and whether the response follows a specific format. This works well for tasks with fixed format correct answers Algorithm 1: Two-Stage Data Generation and Filtering for SFT 1: Input: DSource1, DSource2 (Source datasets for Stages 1 and 2) 2: Input: MQwen (Qwen3-32B), MR1 (DeepSeek-R1), MV 3 (DeepSeek-V3) 3: Output: DSF T 1, DSF T 2 (High-quality datasets for SFT Stages 1 and 2) 4: \u25b7\u2014 Stage 1: Initial Data Generation \u2014 5: DSF T 1 \u2190\u2205 6: for each sentence s in DSource1 do 7: sreasoning \u2190MQwen(s) 8: Add (s, sreasoning) to DSF T 1 9: end for 10: \u25b7\u2014 Stage 2: Iterative Generation and Filtering \u2014 11: DSF T 2 \u2190\u2205 12: for each sentence s in DSource2 do 13: sreasoning1 \u2190MR1(s) \u25b7First generation pass 14: if MV 3 accepts sreasoning1 then 15: Add (s, sreasoning1) to DSF T 2 16: else 17: sreasoning2 \u2190MR1(s) \u25b7Second generation pass for failed instances 18: if MV 3 accepts sreasoning2 then 19: Add (s, sreasoning2) to DSF T 2 20: end if 21: end if 22: end for 23: return DSF T 1, DSF T 2 such as math or coding.

    "22: end for 23: return DSF T 1, DSF T 2 such as math or coding. For GEC, we can also use such a simple method for rewards. Since there might be multiple ways to correct a grammatical error, we can grant the full reward for the entire answer as long as one of the valid cor- rections is met. We use a structured prompt template similar to that in DeepSeek-R1-Zero in Fig2. We use the same <think> tag format as Qwen3 for data generation, so our prompt do not need to specify this formatting requirement. The English translation of this prompt can be found in the Appendix. Our comprehensive reward function, Rtotal, is designed to optimize model outputs for both structural integrity and se- mantic accuracy. It is a sum of two components: a Rule Re- ward (Rrule) and a Correctness Reward (Rc). Rule Reward (Rrule) Rrule combines rewards for cor- rect usage of predefined structural tags: open tag So (<answer>), close tag Sc (</answer>) with a penalty for excess content length (Lsuffix) appearing after a specific delimiter Sd(</answer>). Rrule(T) = + 0.125 \u00b7 I(count(So, T) = 1) + 0.125 \u00b7 I(count(Sc, T) = 1) \u22120.001 \u00b7 I(count(Sc, T) = 1) \u00b7 Lsuffix(T, Sd) (1) Here, I(\u00b7) is the indicator function signifying presence of the respective tags. So, Sc, and Sd are specific predefined string constants. Lsuffix(T, Sd) measures the length of con- tent trailing the delimiter Sd; this penalty component is ap- plied only if the close tag Sc is present. The coefficient for the rule-based reward is set low, as the model has already been refined through a two-stage SFT process before RL training. This reward therefore serves as a minimal penalty aimed only at preventing formatting errors or truncation from repetitive outputs. Correctness Reward (Rc) Rc quantifies the semantic ac- curacy of the model\u2019s extracted answer R, evaluated against the original input sentence Q and the set of ground truth an- swers A. The design of our correctness reward function is guided by the evaluation metric F0.5 score and thus places a strong emphasis on precision. To reflect this, we signifi- cantly reward the model for correctly preserving an error- free sentence. We experimented with reward values of 4 and 6 for this case, ultimately selecting 6 as it yielded a higher F0.5 score. To encourage corrections of erroneous sentences, we assign a process reward of 0.1 for instances where the model modi- fies an incorrect sentence, even if the modification itself is still incorrect. For a correct modification of an erroneous sentence, the model receives a base reward of 2, totaling 2.1 with the process reward. Conversely, to penalize inaction and over-correction, we designed distinct",
    "0.1 for instances where the model modi- fies an incorrect sentence, even if the modification itself is still incorrect. For a correct modification of an erroneous sentence, the model receives a base reward of 2, totaling 2.1 with the process reward. Conversely, to penalize inaction and over-correction, we designed distinct penalties: -0.05 for failing to modify an incorrect sentence, and a harsher -0.1 for incorrectly mod- ifying a correct one. During our experiments, we tested a uniform penalty of -0.1 for both scenarios but found that the differentiated penalties of -0.05 and -0.1 yielded supe- rior performance.

(2) RL Algorithm We use the GRPO algorithm with Clip-Higher strat- egy (Shao et al. 2024) to train the LLMs with our rule re- ward. In each training step, for a given sentence q, we sam- ple a group of candidate outputs {o1, o2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , oG} from the policy model \u03c0\u03b8old. Ai = ri\u2212mean({r1,r2,...,rG}) std({r1,r2,...,rG}) is the com- puted advantage using the group rule-metric mixed rewards {r1, r2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , rG}. GRPO then maximizes the following ob- jective function to optimize \u03c0\u03b8: JGRPO(\u03b8) = Eq\u223cP (Q), {oi}G i=1\u223c\u03c0\u03b8old(O|q) \" 1 G G X i=1 min \u0010 \u03c0\u03b8(oi | q) \u03c0\u03b8old(oi | q) Ai, clip \u0010 \u03c0\u03b8(oi | q) \u03c0\u03b8old(oi | q), 1 \u2212\u03b5low, 1 + \u03b5high \u0011 Ai \u0011 \u2212\u03b2 DKL \u0000\u03c0\u03b8 \u03c0ref \u0001 # , (3) where \u03b5low, \u03b5high and \u03b2 are hyperparameters controlling the PPO clipping threshold and the weight of the Kull- back\u2013Leibler (KL) divergence penalty (Schulman et al. 2017; Shao et al. 2024), respectively. Specifically, \u03b5 deter- mines the permissible range for policy updates, while \u03b2 reg- ulates the magnitude of the KL penalty during training to prevent excessive policy shifts from the reference policy \u03c0ref (typically the initialization of \u03c0\u03b8). DKL \u0000\u03c0\u03b8 \u2225\u03c0ref \u0001 = \u03c0ref(oi|q) \u03c0\u03b8(oi|q) \u2212log \u0010 \u03c0ref(oi|q) \u03c0\u03b8(oi|q) \u0011 \u22121 is the KL divergence approx- imation term.

(2025), we use the Chinese native-speaker datasets FCGEC(Xu et al. 2022) (in-domain) and NaCGEC(Ma et al. 2022) (out-of-domain), which are challenging datasets fea- turing errors and linguistic complexities typical of native speakers. This strategic focus ensures the authentic correc- tion of in-distribution erroneous sentences, mitigating com- mon OOD problems from L2 learner texts, which exhibit distinct error patterns. We focus on Chinese to avoid the evaluation challenges posed by English L2 benchmarks like BEA-19(Bryant et al. 2019) and CoNLL-14(Ng et al. 2014). On these datasets, the strong tendency of LLMs to rewrite sentences for fluency conflicts with evaluation metrics that penalize unnecessary edits, often resulting in low scores. Evaluation Metrics. For the validation set experiments and for the test set NaCGEC, we use the official evaluation tool ChERRANT 1 to evaluate the model based on correction span\u2019s P/R/F0.5. As for the test set FCGEC, we obtain the same evaluation metrics by submitting the system results in CodaLab 2 online platform. Baselines We compare our approach with the following groups of baselines to ensure a comprehensive evaluation. \u2022 Traditional GEC Baselines: We select several estab- lished GEC models for comparison. These include GEC- ToR (Omelianchuk et al. 2020), as a representative of Seq2Edit methods, as well as the Seq2Seq methods BART (Lewis et al. 2019), SynGEC (Zhang et al. 2022), LM-Combiner (Wang et al. 2024a), and MrGEC (Liu et al. 2024). \u2022 LLM-based Baselines: To benchmark against Large Language Model approaches, we first establish two base- lines trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning using our own configuration. The first is trained to directly generate the corrected sentence, while the second is trained to output the sentence after a reasoning process. Additionally, we compare our results against other prominent LLM-based methods, including Instruction Tuning(Liu et al. 2025), Alirector(Yang and Quan 2024), and DeCoGLM(Li and Wang 2024). 1https://github.com/HillZhang1999/MuCGEC/tree/main/ scorers/ChERRANT 2https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/8020 FCGEC NaCGEC System P R F0.5 P R F0.5 Traditional GEC Baselines GECToR (Omelianchuk et al. 2020) 46.11 34.35 43.16 - - - BART (Lewis et al. 2019) 38.38 37.62 38.23 62.04 45.84 57.94 SynGEC (Zhang et al. 2022) 63.75 39.78 56.89 62.42 47.41 58.71 LM-Combiner (Wang et al. 2024a) 55.67 39.04 51.30 - - - MrGEC (Liu et al. 2024) 65.71 37.78 57.22 - - - LLM-based Baselines Instruction Tuning (Liu et al. 2025) 65.65 36.49 56.60 62.50 40.72 56.46 Alirector (Yang and Quan 2024) 64.49 36.22 55.78 66.04 45.91 60.71 De-CoGLM (Li and Wang 2024) 56.09 38.02 51.22 - - - Reasoning Models O3 Mini (Qu, Tang, and Wu 2025) 8.24 19.44 9.31 8.59 21.66 9.77 QWQ 32B (Qu, Tang, and Wu 2025) 17.33",

Training Details. Our Supervised Fine-Tuning process is conducted using the LlamaFactory3. We select Qwen3-8B as the starting model. For training on SFT-stage 1, we configure a batch size of 128 and employ a learning rate of 1e-5. The model is trained for 3 epochs , which takes approximately 20 hours to complete. For training on SFT-stage 2, we configure a batch size of 64 and employ a learning rate of 1e-5. The model is trained for 2 epochs , which take approximately 2 hours to complete. Our implementation on RL is based on the verl4 frame- work. We select the SFT model as starting models for train- ing. During training, we configure a batch size of 128 and utilize 16 rollouts per prompt within the GRPO algorithm. We employ a constant learning rate of 1e-6 and set the sam- pling temperature to 1.0. The maximum generation length for responses is capped at 2000 tokens. We set the KL penalty coefficient \u03b2 to 0. The PPO clipping range \u03f5low is set to 0.2, and \u03f5high is set to 0.28. All models are trained for 5 epochs for about 40 hours on A100 * 8. Inference Details. We evaluate our model under two set- tings. The first is a single pass using greedy decoding (t=0).

We con- 3https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory 4https://github.com/volcengine/verl duct this voting process with 1, 4, 8, 16, and 32 samples. Main Results Our experimental results, presented in Table 3, are analyzed across both in-domain and out-of-domain test sets to provide a comprehensive evaluation of our approach. In-Domain Performance (FCGEC) On the in-domain FCGEC test set, our findings reveal sev- eral key insights. First, among our self-implemented SFT baselines, a clear trade-off emerges. The SFT (Direct Gen- eration) model achieves higher precision and a better F0.5 score, whereas the SFT (with Reasoning) model demon- strates a superior recall rate. This suggests that while direct generation is more conservative, incorporating a reasoning process encourages the model to identify a wider range of errors, albeit at the cost of precision. The introduction of Reinforcement Learning significantly enhances the model that utilizes reasoning. After RL train- ing, the model shows marked improvements in both preci- sion and recall. Ultimately, our model achieves state-of-the- art performance, surpassing all other methods in both recall and the final F0.5 score. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the voting mechanism is particularly pronounced for the RL- trained model, yielding substantial gains across all metrics, which suggests that RL training improves the quality and di- versity of the model\u2019s sampling process. However, the SFT model do not show improvement after voting, and even ex- perienced a performance degradation. When compared with other baselines, our approach demonstrates a significant advantage in recall.

Compared to both Tradi- tional GEC Baselines and other LLM-based Baselines, our final model\u2019s most notable improvement is its substantial increase in recall, underscoring the critical role of reasoning in enhancing error detection. This underscores the critical role of reasoning in enhancing error detection capabilities. So, to fully unlock the potential of LLMs in GEC, it is evi- dent that we must continue to explore and effectively harness their powerful reasoning abilities.

So, to fully unlock the potential of LLMs in GEC, it is evi- dent that we must continue to explore and effectively harness their powerful reasoning abilities. Out-of-Domain Generalization (NaCGEC) On the out-of-domain NaCGEC test set, the results high- light the robustness and generalization capabilities of our RL-based approach. The SFT (Direct Generation) model maintains a reasonable level of performance, demonstrating acceptable generalization. However, the SFT (with Reason- ing) model suffers a significant performance degradation, in- dicating that its complex reasoning process learned via SFT is brittle and does not transfer well to out-of-domain data. Crucially, after being trained with RL, the model\u2019s perfor- mance on the OOD dataset sees a substantial improvement. Moreover, the voting mechanism remains highly effective, further boosting performance. This combined performance lift strongly demonstrates that our RL paradigm fosters more robust and generalizable reasoning. We attribute this to the fact that the reward signal, based on the correctness of the final answer, compels the model to learn fundamental and generalizable principles of grammatical judgment, rather than superficial patterns specific to the training data distri- bution, thereby achieving stronger generalization. Analysis Figure 3 depicts the training dynamics of RL process. The second and third charts show the progression of average re- ward and average response length across rollout samples during the RL process, both of which steadily increase over time. The first chart presents the average entropy. Interest- ingly, the average entropy first decreases and then increases. We attribute this to the model initially focusing on preci- sion to reduce severe over-correction, which lowers explo- ration. The latter increase in entropy indicates a shift to more exploratory behavior that boosts recall.Figure 4 de- picts the correlation between evaluation scores and the num- ber of voting iterations on FCGEC test set; precision and F0.5 scores consistently rose before stabilizing, whereas re- call initially increased and then declined. Performance anal- ysis suggests that the effectiveness of RL may stem from an enhanced quality of sampling, which allows the model to produce higher-quality responses over multiple generations. Conclusion In this work, we have successfully demonstrated the effi- cacy of applying RL with rule-based rewards to the GEC task. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the in-domain FCGEC dataset, and maintains competitive per- formance in recall and F0.5 score on the out-of-domain NaCGEC benchmark. This highlights the strong generaliza- tion and robustness conferred by our RL paradigm. While our method significantly enhances recall, we recognize the room for further improvement in precision. For future work, we will focus on designing a more precise reward for GEC based on the minimum edit distance.",

In this paper, we introduce ThinkDial, the first open-recipe end-to-end framework that successfully implements gpt-oss-style controllable reasoning through discrete operational modes. Our system enables seamless switching between three distinct reasoning regimes: High mode (full reasoning capability), Medium mode (50% token reduction with <10% performance degradation), and Low mode (75% token reduction with <15% performance degradation). We achieve this through an end-to-end training paradigm that integrates budget-mode control throughout the entire pipeline: budget-mode supervised fine-tuning that embeds controllable reasoning capabilities directly into the learning process, and two-phase budget-aware reinforcement learning with adaptive reward shaping.

Correspondence: Jiangjie Chen at jiangjiec@bytedance.com 1 Introduction The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks through extended reasoning chains [1, 2]. However, these models often generate unnecessarily lengthy reasoning processes with redundant steps and circular reasoning, leading to increased computational costs, potential quality degradation through error propagation, and reduced interpretability [1, 2]. This poses a significant challenge for practical deployment, where different scenarios may require different levels of reasoning depth and computational budget. Recent breakthrough systems, notably OpenAI\u2019s gpt-oss series [3], have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities while introducing an innovative paradigm for controlling computational effort through discrete 1 arXiv:2508.18773v1 [cs.CL] 26 Aug 2025 114] ByteDance | Seed 5 10 Thinking Token costs (k) 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 Accuracy AIME 2024 5 10 15 Thinking Token costs (k) 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 Accuracy AIME 2025 0.0 0.5 1.0 Thinking Token costs (k) 0.94 0.95 0.96 0.97 0.98 Accuracy GSM8K 0.0 2.5 5.0 7.5 Thinking Token costs (k) 0.6 0.7 0.8 Accuracy GPQA o3-mini gpt-oss-120b Original Performance Peak Ours Figure 1 Comparison of our ThinkDial and gpt-oss-style model in controllable reasoning.

Circles, squares, and triangles represent Low, Medium, and High modes, respectively. operational modes (e.g., \"Low\", \"Medium\", \"High\"). Unlike explicit token budget methods that require users to specify exact computational constraints [4], the gpt-oss paradigm provides: (1) User accessibility: users can specify their preference without needing technical knowledge of token economics; (2) Dynamic allocation: the system can dynamically allocate computational resources based on problem complexity rather than rigid constraints; Unlike adaptive CoT approaches that are limited to binary switching between thinking and non-thinking modes [5], the gpt-oss framework enables: (3) Fine-grained control: multiple efficiency priorities (Low, Medium, High) can be applied to the same problem based on user requirements. Despite the clear superiority of this mode-based paradigm, the open-source community has largely failed to achieve such capabilities. Existing controllable generation approaches predominantly require explicit specification of token budgets [4, 6\u20138] or rely on adaptive switching between thinking and non-thinking modes [5, 9, 10], both of which lack the intuitive three-mode control paradigm. This gap represents a significant limitation in democratizing advanced reasoning capabilities and has created an urgent need for open-recipe solutions that can match the sophistication of proprietary systems. In this paper, we introduce ThinkDial, the first open-recipe end-to-end framework to successfully implement gpt-oss-style controllable reasoning through discrete operational modes. As shown in Figure 1, our system enables seamless switching between three distinct reasoning regimes: High mode (full reasoning capability), Medium mode (50% token reduction with <10% performance degradation), and Low mode (75% token reduction with <15% performance degradation). The technical foundation of our approach rests on an end-to-end training paradigm that integrates budget-mode control throughout the entire pipeline: (1) Budget-Mode Supervised Fine-tuning: Rather than retrofitting existing models with RL compression techniques, we embed controllable reasoning capabilities directly into the SFT learning process. The key insights are: (a) models must learn to naturally associate different mode specifications with appropriate reasoning patterns, and (b) we must first establish stable output distributions for each mode to prevent interference between different modes during RL training. (2) Budget- Aware Reinforcement Learning: To enable the model to seamlessly switch between three budget modes while preserving its performance ceiling, we employ a two-phase RL training strategy: first conducting warm-up RL training to reach optimal performance, then implementing budget-aware reward shaping with different length rewards for each mode, allowing the model to learn distinct reasoning capabilities with varying response lengths across different modes without compromising its peak reasoning ability. Additionally, we discover that models increasingly exhibit reasoning leakage from thinking sections to answer sections during RL training, a phenomenon we term \"Reasoning Length Hacking\".

Additionally, we discover that models increasingly exhibit reasoning leakage from thinking sections to answer sections during RL training, a phenomenon we term \"Reasoning Length Hacking\". This behavior stems from aggressive compression in Low mode SFT data that caused reasoning overflow, which RL training inadvertently reinforces. To address this issue, we incorporate Leak Penalty in our reward shaping strategy. Extensive experiments across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkDial successfully achieves the target compression-performance trade-offs with remarkable consistency. Our results show clear step-wise thinking token reductions (High \u2192Medium \u2192Low) while maintaining the specified 2 performance thresholds across diverse problem types. The framework also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, maintaining controllable behavior even on out-of-distribution tasks, despite being trained primarily on mathematical reasoning data. The main contributions of this work include: \u2022 The first open-recipe implementation of reasoning control, moving beyond token budget specification. \u2022 An end-to-end training framework that integrates budget-mode control from supervised fine-tuning through reinforcement learning, featuring adaptive reward shaping. \u2022 Comprehensive experimental validation demonstrating robust controllable reasoning across multiple benchmarks with strong out-of-distribution generalization. 2 Related Work CoT Compression Large reasoning models suffer from overthinking, where models generate excessively lengthy chains with redundant steps, circular reasoning, or unnecessary elaboration [1, 2], leading to increased computational costs, potential quality degradation through error propagation, reduced interpretability, and inefficient resource utilization. Many existing works have addressed the overthinking problem through CoT compression techniques, including: (1) constructing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets by selecting short yet correct reasoning chains [11\u201313] and learning summary tokens for training [14], (2) reward shaping during reinforcement learning that rewards short and correct answers [15\u201317], provides dense rewards for higher-quality reasoning processes [18], or rewards early-exit rollouts that stop sufficiently early yet can be resumed to the correct answer [19], and (3) inference-time scaling methods that explore higher-quality intermediate reasoning processes to achieve CoT compression [20]. However, these approaches focus solely on CoT compression without providing controllability\u2014the ability for users to dynamically adjust the reasoning depth based on their specific needs and priorities. Control Reasoning Effort Several works have investigated how to enable models to achieve controllable prioritization between efficiency and performance. (1) Explicit Reasoning Token Budget: Some methods use parameters to control reasoning length by setting explicit token budgets [4, 6\u20138]. However, it is challenging to determine appropriate budgets for problems of varying difficulty, such as comparing GSM8K and AIME problems. (2) Adaptive CoT: These approaches allow models to autonomously decide between thinking and non-thinking modes based on the query [5, 9, 10]. However, they are limited in their ability to provide multiple efficiency priorities for",

(2) Adaptive CoT: These approaches allow models to autonomously decide between thinking and non-thinking modes based on the query [5, 9, 10]. However, they are limited in their ability to provide multiple efficiency priorities for the same problem. (3) Three-Mode Systems offer a structured compromise by providing discrete reasoning levels (low, medium, high) that enable users to explicitly specify their preference for the efficiency-performance trade-off [3]: prioritizing speed for time-sensitive applications, emphasizing accuracy for critical decisions, or balancing both for general use cases. This approach provides intuitive control without requiring users to understand token budgets. However, existing three-mode implementations remain proprietary, with no open-recipe solutions available to the research community. Our work is the first to provide an open-recipe solution for three-mode system, enabling users to achieve controllable efficiency-performance trade-offs without requiring token specification. 3 Method We propose an end-to-end training paradigm for models to learn controllable reasoning capabilities through three sequential steps: (1) Budget-Mode Supervised Fine-tuning to embed mode-specific reasoning patterns directly into the model\u2019s base capabilities; (2) Stage-1 RL training to establish peak performance foundation, thus the following RL training will not compromise the model\u2019s peak reasoning ability; (3) Stage-2 RL training to implement budget-aware reward shaping that enables seamless switching between reasoning modes. 3.1 Budget-Mode Supervised Fine-tuning Previous approaches to controllable reasoning typically focus on the RL training phases. However, we argue that the SFT stage is crucial for establishing the foundation of controllable reasoning capabilities for two 3 reasons: (a) models must learn to naturally associate different mode specifications with appropriate reasoning patterns, and (b) we must first establish stable output distributions for each mode to prevent interference between different modes during RL training. We construct specialized training data that demonstrates how the same problem can be solved with different levels of reasoning depth while maintaining correctness. Starting with high-quality complete reasoning chains for High mode, we systematically derive compressed variants for Medium and Low modes through targeted truncation at approximately rmed and rlow of the original thinking token length. After truncation, we add mode-specific connective text at the end of the thinking section, right before the end-of-think token (\u27e8/think\u27e9), to ensure smooth transitions and logical flow. Then we regenerate the answer section for each truncated sample to ensure the model learns to generate correct answers even when the reasoning is truncated. Only samples that maintain both logical coherence and accuracy are retained. Each reasoning mode is associated with distinct system prompts that guide mode-specific behavior, establishing the semantic relationship between mode specifications and expected reasoning patterns.

The SFT training objective minimizes negative log-likelihood loss across all modes: LSFT = \u22121 N N X i=1 Ti X t=1 log \u03c0\u03b8(oi,t|oi,<t, mi, qi) (1) where N is the total number of training samples, oi,t represents the t-th token in the output sequence of the i-th training sample, Ti denotes the length of the output sequence for the i-th sample, oi,<t represents all tokens before position t in the i-th output sequence, mi \u2208{High, Medium, Low} is the mode indicator for the i-th sample, qi is the input query for the i-th sample, and \u03c0\u03b8 is the model\u2019s policy parameterized by \u03b8. The training data is balanced across the three modes to ensure the model learns appropriate reasoning patterns for each mode while preserving its original capabilities. 3.2 Budget-Aware Reinforcement Learning Our reinforcement learning strategy follows a carefully designed two-phase approach to ensure that controllable reasoning capabilities are built upon a strong performance foundation rather than compromising the model\u2019s peak abilities. 3.2.1 DAPO Framework Our reinforcement learning approach builds upon the Decouple Clip and Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimiza- tion (DAPO) framework [21]. DAPO optimizes the policy by sampling a group of outputs {oi}G i=1 for each input query q (which includes both the mode specification and the problem statement) and corresponding answer a. The optimization objective is formulated as: JDAPO(\u03b8) = E(q,a)\u223cD,{oi}G i=1\u223c\u03c0\u03b8old(\u00b7|q) \" 1 PG i=1 |oi| G X i=1 |oi| X t=1 min \u0010 ri,t(\u03b8) \u02c6Ai,t, clip \u0010 ri,t(\u03b8), 1 \u2212\u03b5low, 1 + \u03b5high \u0011 \u02c6Ai,t \u0011# (2) where the importance sampling ratio is ri,t(\u03b8) = \u03c0\u03b8(oi,t|q,oi,<t) \u03c0\u03b8old(oi,t|q,oi,<t) and the advantage estimate is \u02c6Ai,t = Ri\u2212mean({Ri}G i=1) std({Ri}G i=1) . 3.2.2 Phase 1: Warm-up RL Training In the first phase, we focus exclusively on maximizing model performance without any compression constraints. The model is trained using standard RL objectives to reach its peak reasoning capability, establishing the 4 performance ceiling that will serve as the reference point for subsequent compression. This warm-up phase is critical because it ensures that the model starts from its optimal state before learning to compress reasoning chains. 3.2.3 Phase 2: RL with Budget-Aware Reward Shaping The second phase introduces controllable reasoning through budget-aware reward shaping. We implement different response length rewards for each mode, allowing the model to learn distinct reasoning capabilities with varying response lengths across different modes. However, we discovered that models tend",

We implement different response length rewards for each mode, allowing the model to learn distinct reasoning capabilities with varying response lengths across different modes. However, we discovered that models tend to exploit compression objectives through \"Reasoning Length Hacking\"\u2014reducing thinking tokens within \u27e8think\u27e9tags while compensating with extended reasoning in the answer section, rather than genuinely reducing reasoning depth. To address this issue, we incorporate Leak Penalty in our reward shaping strategy, effectively preventing reasoning spillover into answer sections. Adaptive Reward Shaping Strategies To enable controllable reasoning, we design a composite reward function that balances task performance with response length efficiency. Our approach builds upon the length reward framework from Kimi k1.5 [16] and extends it with mode-specific adaptive mechanisms. The total reward for output oi in mode m is defined as: R(m) i = Rtask(oi) + \u03b1(m) \u00b7 Rlength(oi) + Rleak(oi) (3) where Rtask(oi) \u2208{0, 1} evaluates task correctness through exact answer matching, Rlength(oi) enforces response length constraints, Rleak(oi) \u2208{\u22120.5, +0.5} ensures proper reasoning-answer separation, and \u03b1(m) is the mode-specific scaling coefficient that controls response compression intensity. Mode-Specific Response Length Reward The response length reward component implements mode-specific compression that allows different reasoning capabilities with varying response lengths across different modes: Rlength(oi) = ( \u03bbi if Rtask(oi) = 1 min(0, \u03bbi) if Rtask(oi) = 0 where \u03bbi = 0.5 \u2212len(oi) \u2212lenmin lenmax \u2212lenmin (4) Here, len(oi) denotes the total response length of output oi (including both thinking tokens within \u27e8think\u27e9 tags and answer tokens after \u27e8/think\u27e9), lenmin and lenmax are the minimum and maximum response lengths within the current group, respectively. The normalized response length penalty \u03bbi ensures scale invariance across different problem complexities by mapping response lengths to a standardized [\u22120.5, 0.5] range. Leak Penalty During RL training, we observed that models increasingly exhibit Reasoning Length Hacking behavior, where reasoning content leaks from the thinking section (within \u27e8think\u27e9tags) to the answer section (after \u27e8/think\u27e9). This phenomenon stems from pre-existing patterns in our Budget-Mode SFT data, particularly in Low mode samples, where reasoning often overflows into answer sections due to aggressive compression during data construction. These pre-existing leakage patterns become reinforced during RL training, as they provide a path for models to maintain task correctness while achieving shorter thinking sections. However, this reinforcement of data artifacts defeats our compression objective, as reasoning effort is merely redistributed rather than genuinely reduced. To counteract this undesired pattern reinforcement, we implement: Rleak(oi) = ( +0.5 if no transition keywords in answer section \u22120.5 if transition keywords detected in answer section (5) where \"transition keywords\" refer to reasoning-related tokens such as \"Wait\", \"Let me think\",",
    "reasoning effort is merely redistributed rather than genuinely reduced. To counteract this undesired pattern reinforcement, we implement: Rleak(oi) = ( +0.5 if no transition keywords in answer section \u22120.5 if transition keywords detected in answer section (5) where \"transition keywords\" refer to reasoning-related tokens such as \"Wait\", \"Let me think\", \"Actually\", \"Alternatively\", \"However\", and similar metacognitive expressions that typically indicate ongoing reasoning 5 processes. This binary reward mechanism penalizes the appearance of such keywords in the answer section (content after \u27e8/think\u27e9), discouraging models from reinforcing the leakage patterns inherited from SFT data and ensuring that genuine reasoning compression occurs within the thinking section rather than pattern-based content redistribution. Illustrative cases are shown in Appendix C. 3.3 Inference Usage During inference, users control reasoning modes by using the corresponding mode-specific prompts that were established during training. The model supports three operational modes: High mode for maximum accuracy with full reasoning capability, Medium mode for balanced performance with 50% compression, and Low mode for rapid responses with 75% compression. Users activate each mode by incorporating the respective budget-mode prompts (detailed in Appendix A) into their system prompts, ensuring consistent mode activation without requiring manual parameter tuning. 4 Experiments 4.1 Experimental Setup Datasets and Benchmarks We evaluate ThinkDial across mathematical reasoning benchmarks spanning different difficulty levels: AIME 2025 (hard), AIME 2024 (medium), and GSM8K (easy). Additionally, we use GPQA diamond for out-of-distribution evaluation to assess generalization beyond mathematical domains. For evaluation reliability, we use different sampling strategies: AIME problems are evaluated 32 times each, GSM8K uses 500 randomly sampled problems evaluated 4 times each, and GPQA uses 198 samples evaluated 8 times each. Implementation Details We use Qwen-2.5-Instruct-32B [10] as our foundation model. We first perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) including 12K original reasoning data and 6K Budget-Mode SFT data, with details provided in the Appendix B. For RL training, both the warm-up phase and the length reward shaping phase utilize the same set of 20K in-house mathematical problems. We set truncation ratios rmed = 0.5 and rlow = 0.25 for Medium and Low mode, respectively, and of course, rhigh = 1. The mode-specific scaling coefficients follow a progressive strategy: \u03b1(high) = 0.0, \u03b1(med) = 0.5, and \u03b1(low) = 1.0. Training follows our two-phase strategy: 95 steps on High mode data to establish peak performance, then 40 additional steps with length rewards for controllable reasoning capabilities. Baselines We evaluate ThinkDial against several key baselines to validate the effectiveness of our approach: (1) Peak-Performance Checkpoint: The capability peak checkpoint of the Qwen-2.5-Instruct-32B model after undergoing training with 12K original reasoning data for SFT and 20K in-house mathematical problems for RL.

(2) w/o Budget-Mode SFT: Our framework without specialized mode-conditioned SFT but only original reasoning data to assess controllable reasoning pretraining necessity; (3) Only Budget-Mode SFT: Exclusive mode-specific SFT without RL optimization; (4) w/o Warm-up: Direct compression training without establishing peak performance; (5) Peak Truncation: Simple truncation-based compression at performance peaks; (6) gpt-oss-120b and o3-mini: OpenAI\u2019s proprietary controllable reasoning models for state-of-the-art mode-based comparison. Evaluation Metrics To quantify the overall effectiveness of controllable reasoning, we define a composite metric Accuracy-Cost Trade-off (ACT) Score that balances accuracy retention and compression efficiency. For mode m \u2208{High, Medium, Low}, we compute accuracy retention ratio Am = Accm Accbase and compression rate Cm = 1 \u2212 Costm Costbase , where base values represent the corresponding performance of the peak-performance checkpoint. The ACT score is: 6 Table 1 Overall ACT Score performance. L, M, and H represent Low, Medium, and High modes, respectively. \"w/o BM SFT\" refers to the model trained without Budget Mode SFT data.

Direct Performance Visualization We analyze raw accuracy and thinking token length across modes by compar- ing with gpt-oss-120b and o3-mini to evaluate whether our approach can replicate the controllable reasoning patterns of proprietary systems.

    "Overall Performance Analysis Table 1 presents comprehensive ACT score evaluation results across different benchmarks, validating our core hypothesis that models can learn efficient reasoning without sacrificing problem-solving capabilities. Notably, High mode performance matches or even exceeds the original model baseline, addressing a fundamental concern in compression research\u2014that controllability training might compromise peak performance. The clear step- wise degradation pattern (High \u2192Medium \u2192Low) demonstrates precise control over the accuracy-efficiency trade-off, achieving the target compression rates while maintaining specified performance thresholds. Beyond raw performance metrics, our framework demonstrates intelligent adaptation to problem complexity. The model naturally allocates more reasoning effort to challenging problems (AIME series) while maintaining efficiency on simpler tasks (GSM8K), suggesting learned rather than mechanical compression behavior. Most importantly, direct performance visualizations confirm successful replication of gpt-oss-style patterns\u2014our accuracy-token curves closely match those of gpt-oss-120b and o3-mini, proving that sophisticated mode- based control can be achieved through our approach. Finally, the framework\u2019s robustness extends beyond mathematical reasoning, with GPQA evaluation showing effective transfer to other domains despite training primarily on mathematical data. 4.3 Detailed Analysis We conduct systematic ablations to validate the necessity of each component in our end-to-end training paradigm, using direct performance visualization for comprehensive analysis. Impact of Budget-Mode Supervised Fine-tuning Figure 2 demonstrates the critical role of Budget-Mode SFT in preventing mode interference during RL training. Without specialized SFT, RL training with length rewards alone causes the three operational modes to interfere with each other, leading to performance collapse in High mode that falls significantly below the original performance peak.

    "3 The impact of warm-up RL training on controllable reasoning performance across different modes. undermines the controllable reasoning objectives. With proper SFT initialization, the RL exploration phase cannot cause modes to interfere with each other. Consequently, High mode maintains performance at or above the original peak level, while Medium and Low modes achieve effective compression with controlled degradation. However, while Budget-Mode SFT establishes mode awareness, relying exclusively on SFT without RL optimization leads to significant accuracy degradation in High and Medium modes. This finding validates our end-to-end training paradigm: Budget-Mode SFT provides the essential semantic foundation, while RL optimization fine-tunes the accuracy-efficiency balance. Neither component alone can achieve the sophisticated controllable reasoning demonstrated by our complete framework. The Importance of Two-Phase RL Training Strategy Our two-phase RL training strategy proves essential for effective controllable reasoning. Figure 3 demonstrates that without the warm-up phase (Phase 1) to first establish peak performance, the model struggles to maintain quality in High and Medium modes when budget- aware reward shaping (Phase 2) is introduced. The warm-up phase ensures that compression capabilities are built upon a strong performance foundation rather than compromising the model\u2019s peak abilities. More importantly, Figure 4 compares our approach with the Peak Truncation Method that cuts reasoning chains at peak performance to target token budgets, then asks the model to generate summaries and answers. The visualization reveals that such mechanical truncation completely fails to achieve gpt-oss-style controllable reasoning patterns. While our learned compression maintains smooth degradation curves similar to proprietary systems, the Peak Truncation Method shows catastrophic performance collapse, demonstrating that sophisticated training is essential for effective mode-based reasoning control. Addressing Reasoning Length Hacking Figure 5 presents token statistics comparing models with and without Leak Penalty, revealing the critical importance of addressing Reasoning Length Hacking. The bar chart demonstrates a counterintuitive phenomenon: without Leak Penalty, although thinking tokens decrease as intended, answer tokens significantly increase, resulting in higher total token consumption\u2014defeating our compression objectives. 8 5 10 15 Token costs (k) 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 Accuracy AIME 2024 5 10 15 Token costs (k) 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 Accuracy AIME 2025 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 Token costs (k) 0.93 0.94 0.95 0.96 0.97 0.98 Accuracy GSM8K 0 2 4 6 8 Token costs (k) 0.6 0.7 0.8 Accuracy GPQA o3-mini gpt-oss-120b Original Performance Peak Ours Peak Truncation Figure 4 Performance comparison between our approach and the Peak Truncation Method. low medium high 0 5000 10000 15000 Token Count (k) AIME2024 Thinking Tokens Total Tokens low medium high 0 5000 10000 15000 Token Count (k) AIME2025 low medium high 0 400 800 1200 Token Count (k) GSM8K low medium high 0 5000 10000 15000 Token Count (k) GPQA low",

Total Tokens include both Thinking Tokens and Summary Tokens. However, with Leak Penalty in place, the model not only reduces thinking tokens but also maintains concise answer sections, achieving genuine overall token reduction. This analysis validates that effective controllable reasoning requires preventing models from circumventing compression constraints through reasoning spillover into answer sections. Analysis of BM SFT Data Amount As shown in Figure 6, the relationship between Budget-Mode (BM) SFT data amount and model performance reveals a critical balance in training data composition. We compare two configurations: the balanced setup (6K BM SFT + 12K original reasoning data) versus the BM-heavy setup (12K BM SFT + 12K original reasoning data). First, adding an appropriate amount of BM data does not compromise the model\u2019s performance ceiling and can even provide modest improvements. The balanced configuration maintains the model\u2019s peak reasoning capabilities while establishing effective mode differentiation. Importantly, moderate BM data inclusion does not suppress the model\u2019s output length in High mode, preserving its ability to generate comprehensive reasoning when needed. However, excessive BM SFT data creates significant performance degradation. When BM SFT data increases substantially, the model\u2019s performance ceiling drops noticeably across Medium and Hard questions. More critically, this BM-heavy configuration severely suppresses reasoning length across all operational modes, indicating that the model becomes overly constrained in its reasoning capacity. This length suppression is particularly problematic as it limits the model\u2019s ability to engage in thorough reasoning even when explicitly 9 0 50 100 Step 0.60 0.63 0.66 0.69 0.72 Performance AIME2024 0 50 100 Step 0.48 0.52 0.56 0.60 AIME2025 0 50 100 Step 0.930 0.945 0.960 0.975 GSM8K 0 50 100 Step 12000 13500 15000 16500 18000 Response Length Response Length + 6K BM SFT + 12K BM SFT Only Original Figure 6 Impact of budget mode (BM) SFT data amount on warm-up phase RL training performance and response length.

Our end-to-end training paradigm, combining Budget-Mode Supervised Fine-tuning and Budget-Aware Reinforcement Learning with reward shaping, achieves target compression-performance trade-offs while preserving peak capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach closely matches proprietary systems\u2019 controllable reasoning patterns, significantly outperforming naive truncation methods. By democratizing sophisticated mode-based reasoning control, this work enables broader research and application development in controllable AI reasoning, establishing a foundation for future advances in adaptive computational allocation. 10 References [1] Yang Sui, Yu-Neng Chuang, Guanchu Wang, Jiamu Zhang, Tianyi Zhang, Jiayi Yuan, Hongyi Liu, Andrew Wen, Shaochen Zhong, Hanjie Chen, et al.

Appendix A Mode-Specific System Prompts To enable the switching of model output distributions across different modes, we design distinct system prompts for each reasoning mode using the same data [22]. As shown in Table 2, these mode-specific prompts establish clear semantic relationships between budget constraints and expected reasoning behaviors, guiding the model to adopt appropriate reasoning strategies for each mode.

    "budget-mode supervised fine-tuning, we build a dataset of 6K budget-mode SFT samples based on our in-house training data. The dataset maintains a balanced distribution across reasoning effort levels with a ratio of high:medium:low = 1:1:1, ensuring equal representation of each budget mode during training. For the medium and low budget modes, we set the reasoning effort ratios rmedium and rlow to 50% and 25%, respectively. Additionally, we incorporate 800 GSM8K samples with empty thinking into the low mode to further enhance the model\u2019s ability to provide concise responses under strict budget constraints. Table 3 summarizes the data composition and characteristics for each budget mode. 13 To preserve the model\u2019s general problem-solving capabilities during budget-aware fine-tuning, we incorporate 12K samples of light-R1 long chain-of-thought reasoning data from DeepSeek-R1 [23]. This auxiliary dataset consists of 3K samples from stage 2 training and 9k samples randomly selected from stage 1, providing diverse reasoning patterns that help maintain the model\u2019s foundational reasoning abilities while adapting to budget constraints. B.2 Training Data Examples We present training data examples demonstrating how the same problem is solved with different levels of reasoning depth across the three budget modes. Starting with high-quality complete reasoning chains for High mode, we systematically derive compressed variants for Medium and Low modes through targeted truncation at approximately rmedium (50%) and rlow (25%) of the original thinking token length. Tables 4, 5, and 6 showcase the key differences: (1) the thinking section length varies significantly across modes, with High mode containing the most detailed reasoning process; (2) after truncation, we add mode-specific connective text before the end-of-think marker (highlighted in brown) to ensure smooth logical transitions; and (3) the answer sections are regenerated for each truncated sample to maintain correctness despite the compressed reasoning. Only samples that preserve both logical coherence and accuracy after this construction process are retained in the training data. C Case Study of Leak Penalty To assess the effectiveness of the Leak Penalty, we present two contrasting cases. Without the penalty (Table 7), the model keeps the thinking section brief but moves extensive reasoning\u2014detailed calculations, repeated attempts, and lengthy explanations\u2014into the answer, which is precisely the leak we aim to prevent. With the penalty (Table 8), the model conducts its reasoning within the \u27e8think\u27e9tags and returns a clean, direct answer; the answer section contains only the final summarized solution, achieving genuine compression without loss of quality.

DAPO training is conducted for 135 steps (95 steps High mode + 40 steps budget-aware) with a batch size of 256 and a mini-batch size of 256. The actor is optimized using Adam, with learning rates of 1 \u00d7 10\u22126, and a linear warm-up schedule over 20 steps. Our implementation uses grouped sampling with group size G = 16. For clipping parameters, we set the clip ratio low to 0.2 and clip ratio high to 0.28. During the 95-step warmup phase of RL training, we employ Dynamic Sampling. However, in the RL with length rewards phase, we disable Dynamic Sampling because even when all responses in a group are either correct or incorrect, the presence of length rewards still provides effective gradients. Our implementation is based on the VeRL framework. Rollouts are generated using temperature sampling (\u03c4 = 1.0), with enforced end-of-sequence tokens. We leverage vLLM for efficient batched decoding with 256 rollout slots and paged attention. 14 Prompt for High Mode /* System Prompt */ You have unlimited time to think and respond to the user\u2019s question.

Key Observations: 1. Power of a Point: For point B on the first circle, the power with respect to the second circle is given by BA \u00b7 BD = 5 \u00b7 9 = 45. This power is also equal to |BO2|2 \u2212r2 2. 2. Common Tangent: The length of the common tangent BC can be related to the radii and the distance between centers using the Pythagorean theorem for the external tangent: BC2 = (O1O2)2 \u2212(r1 \u2212r2)2. 3. Coordinate Geometry: Placing A at the origin, O1 at (\u2212r1, 0), and O2 at (r2, 0), we use the coordinates of B and C on the tangent line to relate the radii and solve for r1 and r2. Calculations: \u2022 Using the power of point B, we find r1 = 5 and solve for r2 using the length AD = 4. \u2022 The common tangent length BC is found using the radii and the distance between centers.

( ... 5633 tokens omitted for brevity ) Since both are radii, |O2C| = r2, so k = r2/r1 (since |O1B| = r1). Therefore: x2 = r1 + r2 + r2 r1 x1 y2 = r2 r1 y1 I need to prioritize speed, so I should stop thinking now and provide the most direct answer possible. </think> To solve the problem, we use the power of a point theorem and properties of tangent lines and circles. 1. Power of Point B: The power of point B with respect to the circle centered at O2 is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments from B to the points of intersection with the circle. Here, |BA| = 5 and |AD| = 4, so |BD| = |BA| + |AD| = 9. Thus, the power of B is |BA| \u00b7 |BD| = 5 \u00b7 9 = 45. 2. Distance from B to O2: Let r1 and r2 be the radii of the circles centered at O1 and O2, respectively. Since BC is a common tangent, O1B \u22a5BC and O2C \u22a5BC, so O1B \u2225O2C. The distance between O1 and O2 is r1 + r2. 3.

We need to find the number of nonnegative integer triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and the sum of all pairwise products of the form a2b, a2c, etc., equals 6,000,000. First, let\u2019s denote the sum S = a + b + c = 300 and the other sum as T = a2b + a2c + b2a + b2c + c2a + c2b = 6,000,000. I should balance depth of reasoning with efficiency, so now I\u2019ll stop thinking and deliver a well- considered response. </think> Let\u2019s denote S = a + b + c = 300. We can factor the given sum T = a2b + a2c + b2a + b2c + c2a + c2b = ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a). Since a + b = S \u2212c, b + c = S \u2212a, and c + a = S \u2212b, we can rewrite T as: T = ab(S \u2212c) + bc(S \u2212a) + ca(S \u2212b) = S(ab + bc + ca) \u22123abc Given T = 6, 000, 000 and S = 300, we have: 300(ab + bc + ca) \u22123abc = 6, 000, 000 ( ... solutions omitted for brevity ) But wait, let\u2019s check d = 0 to d = 100: that\u2019s 101 values of d.

There are 99 such d values (1 through 99). - When d = 100: The triple includes a zero: (0,100,200). This has one zero and two distinct non-zeros, so permutations: choose position for 0 (3 choices), then arrange 100 and 200 in the remaining two positions (2 ways): 3 \u00d7 2 = 6. Total permutations: 1 + 99 \u00d7 6 + 6 = 1 + 594 + 6 = 601. Yes, this makes sense because for any nonnegative integer d from 0 to 100, the triple (100 \u2212d, 100, 100 + d) is valid, and each such triple (except all 100s) can be permuted in 6 ways if all distinct, or 6 ways if one is zero.

    "Beyond the Textual: Generating Coherent Visual Options for MCQs Wanqiang Wang1, Longzhu He2*, Wei Zheng1 1Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China 2Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China {wwq2001, 05166}@mail.bnu.edu.cn, helongzhu@bupt.edu.cn Abstract Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a cru- cial role in fostering deep thinking and knowl- edge integration in education. However, previ- ous research has primarily focused on generat- ing MCQs with textual options, but it largely overlooks the visual options. Moreover, gen- erating high-quality distractors remains a ma- jor challenge due to the high cost and lim- ited scalability of manual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Op- tions Synthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual op- tions. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning process and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically plausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a discrimination module to identify content suit- able for visual options. Experimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in content discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over existing methods across various subjects and educational levels. 1 Introduction In the field of education, multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a crucial role in promoting deep think- ing and knowledge integration. Prior studies have shown that well-written MCQs can support learner engagement in higher levels of cognitive reason- ing such as application or synthesis of knowledge (Davis, 2009; Zaidi et al., 2018). Among the com- ponents of MCQs, the difficulty and relevance of distractors are key indicators of question quality (Gierl et al., 2017; Kumar et al., 2023). However, systematically crafting quality assessment ques- tions and distractors in education is a crucial yet time-consuming, expertise-driven undertaking that calls for innovative solutions (Indran et al., 2024).

    "generation of educational questions to alle- viate human labor, including objective and open- ended formats (Cao and Wang, 2021; Rodriguez- Torrealba et al., 2022). Prior to this study, research on MCQs generation using LLMs primarily fo- cused on two areas: generating questions and tex- tual options based on textual input (Cao and Wang, 2021; Le Berre et al., 2022), and incorporating mul- timodal inputs to generate questions and textual op- tions enriched with visual information (Yeh et al., 2022; Wang and Baraniuk, 2023; Luo et al., 2024). However, the task of generating MCQs with visual options remains largely unexplored. According to Mayer\u2019s cognitive theory of multimedia learning (Mayer, 2005), visual stimuli play an indispensable role in promoting learners\u2019 cognitive engagement by facilitating dual-channel processing, reducing extraneous cognitive load, and enhancing the inte- gration of new information with prior knowledge. There are three major challenges in generating MCQs with visual options. Firstly, not all MCQ op- tions are suitable for visual representation (Butler, 2018). For example, mathematical computation problems typically rely on precise numerical or symbolic expressions which is difficult to convey through static images. Secondly, MCQs with vi- sual option require explicit scaffolding for visual arXiv:2508.18772v1 [cs.CV] 26 Aug 2025 analysis; otherwise, students may incur unneces- sary cognitive overload (Kim and Hannafin, 2011). Lastly, current Text-to-Image (T2I) models face key challenges in visual option generation: (i) The inherent variability in visual option generation of- ten leads to inaccurate or unrealistic outputs. (ii) The educational domain lacks specialized image repositories to meet the precise visual needs of aca- demic content. As shown in Figure 1, the goal of our work is to generate an appropriate question and visual options from an input consisting of an image, context, and the answer, via processing pipeline. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named Cross-modal Options Synthesis (CmOS), integrating Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Gen- eration (RAG) to generate MCQs with visual op- tions. Specifically, the framework employs an Mul- timodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to encode multimodal content and embeds it into a four-stage MCoT architecture that separates content discrimi- nation, question and reason generation, alternative pairs screening, and visual options generation. To improve the quality of visual options, we leverage RAG to retrieve similar images from an external educational image database as templates for gener- ation, and then the MLLM and the T2I model are required to optimize based on the templates. The practical and impactful contributions of this work in MCQs can be summarized as follows: \u2022 We first explore how to generate high-quality MCQs with visual options, addressing a key gap in current MCQs generation research. \u2022 We propose a framework named CmOS, which generates questions through",

Early studies in AQG pri- marily focus on textual question generation, com- prising two categories of generation methods. The first is the Level of Understanding approach, en- compassing syntax-based (Afzal et al., 2011; Afzal and Mitkov, 2014) and semantic-based methods (Ai et al., 2015; Afzal and Mitkov, 2014). The sec- ond is the Procedure of Transformation approach, including template-based (Kusuma et al., 2018, 2022), rule-based (Singhal and Henz, 2014; Sing- hal et al., 2015), and statistical methods (Kumar et al., 2015; Uto et al., 2023). However, these meth- ods rely heavily on text as both input and output, exhibiting limited capability in processing multi- modal information. In terms of question types, prior research has mainly addressed open-ended and MCQs (Kurdi et al., 2020; Mulla and Gharpure, 2023), with the latter receiving increasing attention due to their standardized format and ease of au- tomated assessment (Touissi et al., 2022; Al Shu- raiqi et al., 2024; Newton and Xiromeriti, 2024). With the swift progress of LLMs and MLLMs, re- searchers have begun to explore their application in generating high-quality educational questions (Mulla and Gharpure, 2023; Yadav et al., 2023; Newton and Xiromeriti, 2024; Al Shuraiqi et al., 2024). Prompt engineering and fine-tuning have been employed to enhance the effectiveness of these models in question generation, with grow- ing interest in their potential for multimodal MCQs generation (Zhao et al., 2022; Wang and Baraniuk, 2023; Luo et al., 2024). However, current studies on multimodal MCQs generation predominantly focus on aligning images with question context, while significantly overlooking the integration of visual information into option generation progress. 2.2 Chain-of-Thought Prompt Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt is an important technique aimed at enhancing the multi-step reason- ing capabilities of LLMs. Initial work by Wei et al. (2022) showed that few-shot CoT could signifi- cantly improve performance on arithmetic and com- monsense tasks. Later, researchers introduced zero- shot variants, such as appending simple phrases like \u201cLet\u2019s think step by step\u201d. This approach ac- tivated reasoning in LLMs",
    "ing capabilities of LLMs. Initial work by Wei et al. (2022) showed that few-shot CoT could signifi- cantly improve performance on arithmetic and com- monsense tasks. Later, researchers introduced zero- shot variants, such as appending simple phrases like \u201cLet\u2019s think step by step\u201d. This approach ac- tivated reasoning in LLMs without requiring ad- ditional examples (Kojima et al., 2022). To mini- mize the need for manually crafted demonstrations, methods like Auto-CoT were developed (Zhang et al., 2022). These ways leverage LLMs to gen- erate reasoning examples with minimal supervi- sion. Further reliability improvements came from self-consistency decoding, which samples multi- ple reasoning paths and selects the most frequent answer (Wang et al., 2022). Beyond text-based tasks, researchers have extended CoT to multi- modal content and proposed a method named Mul- timodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) (Zhang et al., 2023). MCoT integrates textual and visual rea- soning through several implementation strategies. These include two-stage pipelines that separate ra- tionale generation from answer prediction (Zhang et al., 2023), dual-guidance approaches that dis- entangle visual and textual reasoning (Jia et al., 2024), and methods that interleave image regions with textual steps (Mitra et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2024). These designs enable MLLMs to perform well across various multimodal benchmarks. More related work is discussed in Appendix A. 3 Method Problem Definition Given an input consisting of C = (T, I, A), where T represents the text and I represents the image, and A denotes the answer, the task is to generate an output that includes a high- quality question Q, a visual option A\u2032 correspond- ing to the answer, and multiple visual distractors Ds, each associated with a textual distractor. 3.1 Model Architecture As illustrated in Figure 2, our CmOS consists of four distinct stages: (i) evaluating content convert- ibility, (ii) generating alternative questions and reasons, (iii) selecting the optimal pair, and (iv) generating option descriptions and visual options. To address the complexity of content discrimina- tion, question and reason generation, and visual option generation, we introduce the MCoT prompt. This method enables MLLMs to identify suitable content for conversion, generate questions and rea- sons towards the answer, and guide the genera- tion of visual options, based on dynamically exem- plars. Specifically, in stage (a), we retrieve relevant multimodal exemplars from an external repository, which includes the original content (text and image) along with convertibility judgments and reasons. They are used to construct dynamic MCoT prompts, enhancing the model\u2019s accuracy in content discrim- ination. In stage (b), we provide three reference processes for each question-reason pair, directing the MLLM to emulate the exemplar reasons.

    "MCoT prompts, enhancing the model\u2019s accuracy in content discrim- ination. In stage (b), we provide three reference processes for each question-reason pair, directing the MLLM to emulate the exemplar reasons. In stage (c), the Optimal Question-Reason Match- ing (OQRM) module selects the optimal question- reason pair based on internal and external consis- tency. In stage (d), the option generator produces textual options and their corresponding visual de- scriptions. Based on these descriptions, relevant images are dynamically retrieved from an external image database, serving as reference templates for generating visual options. Iterative evaluation and tuning using a Text-to-Image (T2I) model further improve the quality of the visual options. 3.2 Exemplars Construction and Retrieval We construct exemplars using Qwen2.5-VL-72B (Bai et al., 2023), a MLLM with strong visual un- derstanding and instruction-following capabilities. The exemplars include two parts: (i) the original MCQ\u2019s context, image, and answer; and (ii) the judgment and reason about its convertibility. We ex- tract 482 questions from the ScienceQA test dataset as the foundation for exemplars construction. After constructing the exemplars dataset DE, we introduce an exemplar retrieval mechanism to as- sist the discriminator in accurately and efficiently determining the convertibility of the given con- tent. Specifically, we adopt the latest FARE en- coder (Schlarmann et al., 2024), which enhances robustness over CLIP. The FARE consists of a visual encoder \u03d5 : I \u2192RD and a text encoder \u03c8 : T \u2192RD. For a given instance S to be con- verted, we separately encode its corresponding con- text t, answer a, and image i as Vt, Va, and Vi. Let I = {1, 2, . . . , N} be the index set of exemplars. Denote the encoded vectors of the j-th exemplar\u2019s text, answer, and image as Vj t , Vj a, and Vj i , respec- tively. We compute cross-modality similarities: Simj m = Vj m \u00b7 Vm \u2225Vj m\u22252 \u2225Vm\u22252 , m \u2208{t, a, i}. (1) Select the exemplar by the maximum similarity: j\u22c6= arg max j\u2208I max \u0000Simj t, Simj a, Simj i \u0001 . (2) The exemplar with index j\u22c6is concatenated with instance S before being fed into the discriminator. 3.3 Optimal Question-Reason Match After being processed by the question generator and reason generator with MCoT, several question- reason pairs are produced. To determine which pair is most suitable for generating multiple visual op- tions, we introduce the Optimal Question-Reason Match module (OQRM), which can calculates a Total Match Score (TMS) for each question-reason pair to effectively identify the optimal candidate.

The visual encoder \u03d5 encodes the image i from the instance S to obtain a high-dimensional vector representation Vi. The text encoder \u03c8 processes three textual components: the newly generated question q, the reason r, and the phrase \"a photo of A\" p, yielding vectors Vq, Vr, and Vp, respec- tively. The TMS for the k-th (k \u22081, 2, . . . , m) question-reason pair (qk, rk) is calculated as the weighted sum of two similarity scores: internal consistency Cintk and external consistency Cextk. Cintk measures the coherence of the question- reason pair within its embedding space RD, iden- tifying the pair closest to the center (CQ, CR) to ensure coherence. Cextk evaluates the similarity between the pair and the original content. This approach aligns with the self-consistency method proposed by (Wang et al., 2022), which selects the most consistent reason path to mitigate",

This approach aligns with the self-consistency method proposed by (Wang et al., 2022), which selects the most consistent reason path to mitigate hallucina- tions and avoid generating irrelevant distractors. Cintk = Vqk \u00b7 CQ \u2225Vqk\u22252\u2225CQ\u22252 + Vrk \u00b7 CR \u2225Vrk\u22252\u2225CR\u22252 (3) where CQ= 1 m Pm k=1 Vqk, CR= 1 m Pm k=1 Vrk.

Based on the RAG, we propose an adaptive method to generate visual options. This method integrates the excellent text-image alignment ability of the MLLM G with the generation and enhancement capabilities of the Text-to-Image (T2I) model P. We construct an image database D by collect- ing images ij from the ScienceQA and generating corresponding captions cj (j = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , s) us- ing MLLM. Given an option description di (i = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , t), we compute the total similarity be- tween di and each image-caption pair as following: Simij = \u03b2 \u03d5(ij) \u00b7 \u03c8(di) \u2225\u03d5(ij)\u22252\u2225\u03c8(di)\u22252 | {z } image-description + \u03c8(cj) \u00b7 \u03c8(di) \u2225\u03c8(cj)\u22252\u2225\u03c8(di)\u22252 | {z } caption-description (6) For each option description di, we retrieve the ee, \u00a2, \u201cay \u201cuy wy image ij from D with the highest Simtotal ij as tem- plate. Using description di and templateij, the image generator P produces a visual image, which is then evaluated by G to obtain a similarity score Simk. If Simk meets or exceeds the threshold \u03c3 = 0.8, the image is accepted. Otherwise, G pro- vides suggestions S to P for iterative tuning of the generated image up to three rounds. 4 Experiment 4.1 Experimental Setups Dataset To evaluate our framework\u2019s perfor- mance in content discrimination, question and vi- sual option generation, we constructed our test datasets based on the ScienceQA benchmark test set DO(Lu et al., 2022). Each record in DO con- tains the context, question, options, answer, grade, subject, and so on. We randomly sampled 482 instances from DO and added \u201cconvertible\u201d and \u201creason\u201d to form the exemplar set DE.

    "record in DO con- tains the context, question, options, answer, grade, subject, and so on. We randomly sampled 482 instances from DO and added \u201cconvertible\u201d and \u201creason\u201d to form the exemplar set DE. In this paper, convertible denotes whether the original content contains core entities or concepts that can be clearly visualized and transformed into image-option ques- tions while maintaining or enhancing cognitive de- mand. The remaining data comprised DC, input to the content discrimination module. Each record in DC includes the context, image, and answer. From DC, 812 (40%) convertible instances were selected as DQ for downstream tasks. Three human annota- tors evaluated the convertibility of DC, and 51.6% of the instances were labeled \u201cTRUE\" in the con- vertible column. They also created new questions for DQ. A summary of the four datasets can be found in Appendix B and Figure 8. Metrics We adopt automatic and human evalua- tion to assess the performance of CmOS. Specifically, different tasks are evaluated using tailored metrics. For content discrimination, we use Accuracy to measure the its ability to identify convertible con- tent. For question generation, we utilize BLEU-4 (Papineni et al., 2002) and ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004) for question generation, both of which have been widely used in AQG works. For visual option, we adopt the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) (Sara et al., 2019) and the CLIP-T (Li et al., 2024) as evaluation metrics. SSIM evaluates the perceptual quality of visual options by jointly modeling lumi- nance, contrast, and structural consistency. CLIP-T quantifies the semantic alignment between gener- ated visual option and the corresponding descrip- tion. Given the limitations of automatic evaluation in capturing human perception, we further incor- porate human evaluation. The specific criteria are presented in the human evaluation section. Baselines For content discrimination and ques- tion generation, we compare our CmOS with state- of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including VL-T5 (Yeh et al., 2022), MultiQG-Ti (Wang and Baraniuk, 2023), Multimodal-CoT (Zhang et al., 2023), Chain-of-Exemplar (Luo et al., 2024) (All these baselines, as well as our CmOS, adopt QWEN2.5- VL-7B-INSTRUCT (Bai et al., 2023) as the back- bone), and CHATGPT under both zero-shot and in-context learning settings (with up to three ex- emplars in prompts). For visual option generation, due to the limited prior work on educational dis- tractor visuals, we evaluate off-the-shelf model APIs (FLUX-SCHNELL, DALLE-3, STABLE DIFFUSION-XL, WANX2.1-PLUS) using identical option descriptions. Our method adopts QWEN2.1- TURBO as the backbone. Baselines and other ex- perimental details are provided in Appendix C. 4.2 Evaluation on Content Discrimination First, we evaluate the discrimination accuracy of CmOS and baselines in determining content convert- ibility.

Baselines and other ex- perimental details are provided in Appendix C. 4.2 Evaluation on Content Discrimination First, we evaluate the discrimination accuracy of CmOS and baselines in determining content convert- ibility. As shown in Figure 3, CmOS, which retrieves similar exemplars from a small pool, significantly improves the accuracy and achieves an average of 88.2%, outperforming all baselines. Notably, al- though CHATGPT shows lower accuracy in the zero-shot, few-shot prompt significantly enhances its score. Particularly, its average accuracy under the 3 shot becomes comparable to CoE. In terms of subject domains, all baseline mod- els exhibit the lowest discrimination accuracy on questions from the Natural Sciences (NAT), while achieving the highest accuracy on those from the Language Sciences (LAN). Furthermore, ques- tions accompanied by images (IMG) tend to yield lower discrimination accuracy compared to text- only questions (TXT), indicating potential chal- lenges in multimodal reason. In addition, questions designed for students in higher grades are generally more difficult to discriminate accurately than those intended for lower grades, suggesting increased complexity in advanced educational content. 4.3 Evaluation on Question Generation Automatic Evaluation Table 1 presents the per- formance of CmOS with \u03b1 = 0.6, compared to SOTA models in terms of BLEU-4 and ROUGE-L. 20 40 60 80 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 20 40 60 80 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 20 40 60 80 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 20 40 60 80 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 20 40 60 80 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 20 40 60 80 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 20 40 60 80 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 20 40 60 80 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Accuracy(%) Accuracy(%) Accuracy(%) Accuracy(%) Accuracy(%) Accuracy(%) Accuracy(%) Accuracy(%) 0 shot 1shot 3 shot VL-T5 MultiQG-TI Multimal-CoT CoE CmOS(Ours) w/o Exemplar NAT SOC LAN TXT IMG G1-6 G7-12 AVG Figure 3: Automatic evaluation results of content discrimination.

Among them, MultiQG-TI and Multimodal-CoT, which leverage MLLMs fine-tuned with CoT prompting, slightly outperform VL-T5, a pretrained language model enhanced with visual understanding.

The table also reports CHATGPT\u2019s performance under zero-shot and few-shot. Al- though CHATGPT benefits from more in-context examples, it remains substantially behind our CmOS on the multimodal question generation. Furthermore, across the three subjects, all base- lines consistently achieve the highest performance in Social Science (SOC) and the lowest in Lan- guage Science (LAN). These baselines also exhibit improved performance on image-paired questions (IMG) compared to text-only ones (TXT). In con- trast, CmOS demonstrates stable performance across different subjects and grade levels, highlighting the general ability of the framework in educational content. However, BLEU-4 and ROUGE-L primar- ily measure surface-level lexical overlap between generated and reference questions, failing to cap- ture semantic relevance. To address this limitation, we incorporate the METEOR metric (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), which accounts for semantic match- ing, and also report the results in Appendix D. Human Evaluation In addition to automatic evaluation, we conduct human evaluation to further assess the quality of generated questions. We ran- domly sample 50 questions from different methods and recruit three annotators to rate each question on a 1-5 scale across four criteria: (1) Fluency (Song and Zhao, 2016), assessing the naturalness and readability of the question; (2) Grammatical- ity (Heilman, 2011), measuring syntactic correct- ness; (3) Complexity (Rodriguez-Torrealba et al., 2022), evaluating the cognitive or linguistic chal- lenge posed by the question; and (4) Relevance (Chughtai et al., 2022), measuring how well the question matches the background content. Detailed guidelines are provided in Appendix H. As shown in Table 2, although the ground-truth questions achieve the highest scores across all met- rics, CmOS outperforms all baselines and obtains the closest performance to the ground-truth, with an average score of 4.58. These results demon- strate that our framework can generate high-quality educational questions that are fluent, correct, en- gaging, and relevant to the content. Moreover, both Multimodal-CoT and CoE significantly outperform VL-T5, highlighting the effectiveness of MCoT rea- soning. Although CHATGPT trails CmOS in com- plexity and relevance, it surpasses VL-T5 in fluency and grammaticality, indicating its strong ability to generate well-formed natural language context. 4.4 Evaluation on Visual Option Generation Automatic Evaluation Table 3 presents auto- matic evaluation results for visual option gener- ation with \u03b2 = 1.4.

Benefiting from strong semantic understanding and stylistic gener- alization, WANX2.1-PLUS slightly outperforms the other three baselines in most categories. In contrast, no substantial differences are observed among the remaining baselines. The hyperparameter analysis results for \u03b1 and \u03b2 are provided in Appendix E. To further evaluate performance across disci- plines, we analyze the results for three academic subjects. Remarkably, CmOS achieves the best per- formance in the social sciences (SOC), but per- forms worst in language sciences (LAN), mirroring the trends observed in question generation perfor- mance. Moreover, for image-equipped (IMG) ques- tions, CmOS obtains the highest scores in both SSIM and CLIP-T, while for text-only (TXT) questions, its performance degrades significantly on both met- rics. The findings demonstrate that visual input enhances the semantic fidelity and contextual plau- sibility of generated descriptions. Additionally, the consistently strong performance of our CmOS framework across subjects and grade levels further demonstrates its robust generalization ability. Human Evaluation Similarly, we invited three qualified annotators to subjectively evaluate the vi- sual options generated by different methods. Using a 5-point Likert scale, they rated each visual option across three important dimensions: (1) Plausibil- ity (Luo et al., 2024), assessing coherence with the background content and question context; (2) Distractibility (Gierl et al., 2017), measuring the cognitive burden posed by distractor visual options; and (3) Engagement (Gierl et al., 2017), reflect- ing how much the visual options attract learners\u2019 attention.

This indicates that the visual options it generates are more semantically consistent and possess a higher level of misleadingness, sufficient to test human judgment. However, even though image templates and tuning was carried out to enhance engagement, the improvement is relatively limited. CmOS performs slightly worse than DALLE-3 but marginally better than STABLEDIFFUSION-XL. It is worth noting that the average scores across all methods are relatively low. Specifically, CmOS only achieves a score of 3.55 out of 5. This situation highlights that creating visual content with peda- gogical effectiveness still poses a large challenge. 4.5 Ablation Study We perform ablation studies to investigate the ef- fects of the proposed approaches in terms of similar exemplar retrieval, optimal question-reason match, template and tuning, as presented in Figure 3, Table 1 and Table 3. There are several notable findings. Finding1: Figure 3 illustrates that removing the retrieval of similar exemplars forces the model to rely solely on abstract judgment criteria when as- sessing whether input content can be converted into visual-option questions. This change causes accu- racy to drop by 19.5%, suggesting that concrete reason exemplars contribute more effectively to Method Subject Modality Grade AVG SSIM\u2191/ CLIP-T\u2191 NAT SOC LAN TXT IMG G1-6 G7-12 Flux.schnell 39.0/28.9 41.5/29.1 29.7/29.4 37.6/29.4 42.2/28.2 39.2/29.2 38.8/28.5 39.1/29.0 DALLE-3 40.2/30.1 43.8/29.3 30.6/29.0 38.4/30.2 43.1/29.0 42.4/29.9 39.5/29.3 40.2/29.7 StableDiffusion-XL 40.6/27.3 43.9/28.5 31.4/27.4 39.4/28.4 43.5/27.1 41.2/28.1 40.8/27.5 40.7/27.9 Wanx2.1-plus 41.8/31.6 44.9/30.2 32.1/28.5 40.6/30.4 44.7/32.3 42.1/31.2 40.8/30.1 41.5/30.8 CmOS(Wanx2.1-turbo) 59.0/40.6 61.2/42.8 49.7/37.6 58.3/38.4 62.1/42.7 59.7/40.7 59.1/39.5 59.5/40.2 w / o Discriminator 58.2/29.3 59.4/30.9 49.1/25.6 54.8/26.9 60.3/31.1 57.9/29.3 56.8/27.7 57.5/28.8 w / o Reasoning 50.8/38.0 58.8/40.3 42.0/36.3 50.9/37.6 54.0/41.3 52.5/39.6 51.7/38.0 52.3/39.1 w / o Template 48.0/41.5 50.7/44.6 38.8/36.9 47.4/40.1 50.8/43.3 48.9/41.6 47.2/40.3 48.3/41.1 w / o Tuning 54.8/31.7 57.7/35.2 44.8/29.5 53.9/30.5 58.1/35.4 55.4/33.5 54.7/31.4 55.1/32.7 Table 3: Automatic evaluation results of visual option generation. \u2191: higher is better.

Finding2: In question generation, as shown in Table 1, removing the discriminator leads to BLEU- 4 and ROUGE-L drops of 2.6 and 5.1, reflecting weaker semantic alignment and greater inconsis- tency. This indicates that unconvertible inputs dis- rupt downstream processing, thereby diminishing coherence and overall quality. For visual option generation, as shown in Table 3, SSIM remains largely unchanged, whereas CLIP-T decreases by 11.4, the largest drop among ablations. These re- sults indicate that unsuitable inputs hinder the T2I model\u2019s ability to align images with text. Finding3: Table 1 clearly reveals that excluding the OQRM module significantly weakens question generation, with BLEU-4 plummeting by 33.1 and ROUGE-L dropping by 7.3. This sharp decline underscores OQRM\u2019s importance in identifying question-reason pairs with strong lexical and se- mantic fidelity to human-written references. Finding4: As shown in Table 3, when the rea- son generator is removed and distractors are pro- duced solely from the question and answer, both SSIM and CLIP-T scores decline to varying extents. Specifically, SSIM decreases by 7.2, while CLIP- T shows a slight drop of 1.1. This indicates that the inclusion of reasons primarily enhances the vi- sual similarity among options, with comparatively smaller effects on image-text alignment. Finding5: As shown in Table 3, removing the template results in an 11.2 drop in SSIM, while CLIP-T scores unexpectedly improve. This diver- gence suggests that templates enhance visual con- sistency across options but may impose constraints that hinder semantic alignment with textual descrip- tions. Further ablation reveals that disabling tuning by MLLM and T2I model consistently leads to notable declines in both SSIM (\u22124.4) and CLIP- T (\u221212.5), reinforcing the importance of iterative tuning strategies for improving intra-option visual similarity and cross-modal coherence. 4.6 Case Study To qualitatively assess the three important mod- ules in CmOS, Figures 4 and 5 present representative examples from ScienceQA, which include the con- text, an image, and an answer. Without computing Total Match Scores (TMS) across multiple candi- date question-reason pairs to select the one with the highest alignment, the generator tends to generate the most probable question, which often leads to suboptimal performance in question generation. To further examine the effect of the template and tuning modules on visual option generation, a com- parative example are shown in Figure 5. When the template module is incorporated, the generated vi- sual options exhibit improved semantic plausibility and consistency with object properties.

When the template module is incorporated, the generated vi- sual options exhibit improved semantic plausibility and consistency with object properties. In contrast, removing both the template and tuning modules re- sults in outputs that deviate from commonsense ex- pectations and display stylistic inconsistency. Ad- ditionally, the example illustrates that the tuning process enables iterative refinement: even if the ini- tial visual option is inadequate, tuning can adjust and improve it toward the desired quality. These findings suggest that the template module ensures baseline plausibility, while the tuning supports op- timization, and their combination contributes to overall improvements in visual option quality.

Specifi- cally, we utilize MLLMs to encode multimodal contexts and incorporate them into a three-stage Multimodal-CoT framework, namely content dis- crimination, question generation, and visual option generation. Meanwhile, we introduce a similar ex- emplar retrieval module to guide the discrimination. What\u2019s more, we use OQRM module to select opti- mal question and reasoning progress. Finally, we leverage template-based and slight tuning strategies to generate educational visual options. Our exper- imental results on three test sets demonstrate that",
    "Meanwhile, we introduce a similar ex- emplar retrieval module to guide the discrimination. What\u2019s more, we use OQRM module to select opti- mal question and reasoning progress. Finally, we leverage template-based and slight tuning strategies to generate educational visual options. Our exper- imental results on three test sets demonstrate that CmOS outperforms all existing methods and models, achieving new state-of-the-art performance. More importantly, our study highlights the potential of visual-option-based multiple-choice question gen- eration to enhance multimodal teaching resources, support personalized learning, and foster deeper understanding in educational settings. Limitations Despite its promising performance, our proposed framework still has two limitations. Exemplar Resource On one hand, similar to CoE framework, our similar exemplar-based strat- egy for enhancing content discrimination accuracy has an inherent limitation: the dependency on a fixed pool of exemplars. When the input content falls outside the distribution of datasets like Sci- enceQA, the retrieved exemplars may exhibit low semantic similarity, leading to degraded discrimi- nation performance. To mitigate this, future work could explore adaptive retrieval mechanisms or aug- ment the exemplar pool with more diverse, domain- general instances, possibly using synthetic data or continual learning techniques to improve general- ization beyond the source domain. Visual Option Quality On the other hand, despite improvements in text-image alignment through image templates and lightweight tuning, the generated visual options still suffer from lim- ited visual detail, occasional content hallucinations, and inconsistent style. Human evaluation (Table 4) shows relatively low scores in plausibility and dis- tractibility, indicating that some generated visual options are semantically weak, visually indistinct, or pedagogically uninformative, thereby limiting their effectiveness in supporting deep cognitive processing or engaging prior knowledge. These issues stem from the use of general-purpose im- age generation models that are not optimized for educational applications, often resulting in irrele- vant, ambiguous, or stylistically incoherent outputs. Future work could fine-tune generation models on curated educational datasets and apply task-specific constraints or multimodal alignment objectives to improve clarity, visual contrast, semantic accuracy, and pedagogical value. Ethics Statement We comply with institutional ethical guidelines throughout this study. No private or non-public data was used. For human annotation (Sections 4.3 and 4.4), six annotators were recruited from the schools of education at local universities via public advertisements, with clear disclosure of compen- sation terms. All annotators were senior under- graduate or graduate students in education-related programs who participated on a part-time basis. Each annotator was compensated at a rate of 55 CNY per hour, which exceeds the local minimum hourly wage for part-time employment in 2025 (23.5 CNY/hour). The annotation process did not involve any personally sensitive information. Sample A Sample B Mass of each particle: 28 u Mass of each particle: 32 u Haverage particle speed: 1.100",

    "and event-centric summarization. arXiv preprint arXiv:2203.14187. A Related Works Educational question is an indispensable compo- nent of instructional resources, serving multiple functions including assessment, guidance, feed- back, and the promotion of active learning (Tofade et al., 2013; Thalheimer, 2014). However, manu- ally authoring educational questions is a complex and resource-intensive task that requires profes- sional training, domain knowledge, and instruc- tional experience (Davis, 2009; Kim et al., 2012). To address the high cost and inefficiency associated with manual question generation, Automatic Ques- tion Generation (AQG) technologies have emerged as a promising solution (Brown et al., 2005), and have been widely applied in dialogue systems (Gao et al., 2019; Gu et al., 2021; Bulathwela et al., 2023) and intelligent tutoring systems (Kulshreshtha et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2022; Yadav et al., 2023), becom- ing a prominent research focus within the field of Artificial Intelligence in Education to support per- sonalized learning (Bulathwela et al., 2023; Fawzi et al., 2024; Lamsiyah et al., 2024). B Dataset Details Figure 8 shows four datasets distribution across 3 subjects (NAT, SOC, LAN), 2 modalities (IMG, TXT), and 2 grade ranges (G1-6, G7-12). Question types: NAT = natural science, SOC = social science, LAN = language science, TXT = only containing text, IMG = containing image, G1-6 = grades 1-6, G7-12 = grades 7-12. For DO, NAT has 2, 252, SOC 1, 100, and LAN 889; IMG has 2, 224 and TXT 2, 017; G1-6 has 2, 723 and G7-12 has 1, 518. For DE, NAT has 257, SOC 128, and LAN 97; IMG has 228 and TXT 254; G1-6 has 309 and G7- 12 has 173. For DC, NAT has 1, 990, SOC 969, and LAN 787; IMG has 1, 795 and TXT 1, 964; G1-6 has 2, 723 and G7-12 has 1, 036. For DQ, NAT has 576, SOC 236; IMG has 571 and TXT 241; G1-6 has 568 and G7-12 has 244. C Implementation Details To ensure fair and reproducible evaluation of visual option generation baselines, we report the detailed settings of all off-the-shelf generative models used in our experiments. As part of our pipeline, we em- ploy Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct (Bai et al., 2023) for content discrimination, question generation, and the production of visual option descriptions. More- over, we uniformly set the decoding parameters to top-p = 0.8 and temperature = 0.7. To generate corresponding images, we use Wanx2.1-turbo as our main image synthesis backbone. Additionally, we utilize the robust Contrastive Language\u2013Image Pretraining model FARE (Schlarmann et al., 2024) for retrieval and evaluation. Below, we present the configurations of these models and the prompting details for MCoT.

D METEOR Unlike BLEU-4 and ROUGE-L, which focus on lexical overlap, METEOR (MTR) also captures semantic and content-level similarities. Table 7 shows that CmOS consistently outperforms SOTA methods in question generation under the ME- TEOR metric. While its score in the language sci- ences (LAN) is lower than in natural (NAT) and social sciences (SOC), it still significantly exceeds other methods. This suggests that CmOS generates semantically aligned questions, aided by its multi- question filtering strategy. Moreover, MultiQG-TI and Multimodal-CoT 51.4 57.1 60.9 78.2 74.0 69.2 64.5 0.0 20.0 40.0 60.0 80.0 \u03b1=0.1 \u03b1=0.2 \u03b1=0.4 \u03b1=0.6 \u03b1=0.8 \u03b1=1.0 \u03b1=1.2 BLEU-4 ROUGE-L METEOR AVG Figure 6: The overall performance of question genera- tion with varying \u03b1. that are fine-tuned with CoT prompting, achieve better performance than VL-T5.

Although VL- T5 benefits from stronger visual understanding, it lags behind in semantic coherence during ques- tion generation. In contrast, CoE leverages Chain of Exemplar reasoning to further enhance its gen- eration quality, outperforming both MultiQG-TI and Multimodal-CoT. Additionally, the table in- cludes results for CHATGPT under zero-shot and few-shot settings. While CHATGPT benefits from increased contextual exemplars and achieves ME- TEOR scores that approach those of some base- lines, it still falls considerably short of CmOS in mul- timodal question generation, highlighting its limi- tations in complex reasoning and visual-semantic integration. Similarly, we evaluated the performance of CmOS after removing the Optimal Question-Reason Match (OQRM) module. A noticeable perfor- mance drop was observed, with the average ME- TEOR score decreasing by 17.3 points. This result highlights the importance of OQRM in enhancing the semantic alignment between generated ques- tions and questions authored by humans. E Hyperparameter Analysis Question Generation To determine the optimal hyperparameter \u03b1 for selecting the best question-reason pair, we system- atically examined the BLEU and ROUGE-L scores across varying values of \u03b1 from 0.1 to 1.2 in steps of 0.1 or 0.2. What\u2019s more, we sampled 300 in- stances from Dc where the value of \"convertible\" is true, ensuring no overlap with the dataset DQ. As shown in Figure 6, both scores exhibit a trend of first increasing and then decreasing. Notably, BLEU-4, ROUGE-L and METEOR reach their peak values when \u03b1 = 0.6. The average of the 41.7 43.1 44.0 44.8 47.6 49.9 47.3 46.8 0.0 15.0 30.0 45.0 60.0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 \u03b2=0.4 \u03b2=0.6 \u03b2=0.8 \u03b2=1.0 \u03b2=1.2 \u03b2=1.4 \u03b2=1.6 \u03b2=1.8 CLIP-T SSIM AVG Figure 7: The overall performance of question genera- tion with varying \u03b2. two scores also reaches its highest value of 78.2 at this point. Therefore, we select \u03b1 = 0.6 as the optimal value. Visual Option Generation To determine the optimal hyperparameter \u03b2 for balancing the influence of the image itself and its caption during template retrieval, we systemati- cally evaluated the changes in structural similarity (SSIM) and text-image similarity (CLIP-T) scores for the generated visual options across different values of \u03b2. As shown in the Figure 7, \u03b2 was gradually increased from 0.4 to 1.8 in increments of 0.2. The results indicate that both SSIM and CLIP-T scores exhibit a trend of initially increas- ing and then decreasing as \u03b2 increases. Specifically, when \u03b2 = 1.4, the SSIM score reaches its peak at 59.3, and the CLIP-T score also achieves its high- est value of 40.4. Therefore, we select \u03b2 = 1.4 as the optimal value within the range of",

Specifically, when \u03b2 = 1.4, the SSIM score reaches its peak at 59.3, and the CLIP-T score also achieves its high- est value of 40.4. Therefore, we select \u03b2 = 1.4 as the optimal value within the range of our exper- imental settings for the subsequent visual option generation task. F Analysis of Question Diversity We adopt Distinct-n scores to evaluate the diversity of questions generated. Specifically, this metric cal- culates the number of unique n-grams at the corpus level, where higher values indicate greater diver- sity. We consider values of n ranging from 1 to 4. As shown in the table 5, overall performance improves with increasing n. Both CHATGPT\u2019s 0- shot and few-shot settings exhibit relatively high question diversity. Aside from CHATGPT, CmOS only falls slightly behind CoE on Distinct-1, while it surpasses the baseline methods on other three metrics. When compared to the Groundtruth, we find that both CoE and CmOS achieve scores close to human-generated questions, suggesting that these two methods better approximate the style and dis- tribution of human-authored question diversity. Method Distinct-1 Distinct-2 Distinct-3 Distinct-4 0shot 19.68 38.32 49.89 58.81 1shot 18.46 34.16 44.49 53.32 3shot 17.21 30.80 39.95 47.93 VL-T5 12.11 23.95 30.93 37.74 MultiQG-TI 13.39 24.54 31.63 38.02 Multimodal-CoT 15.92 23.31 36.20 40.47 CoE 17.20 29.47 38.18 45.74 CmOS 16.85 34.65 40.72 47.22 Grondtruth 17.41 31.56 40.46 47.97 Table 5: Distinct-n results of different methods. G Analysis of Different Base Models To analyse the generality of CmOS, we conduct an experiment to utilize other base models in place of QWEN2.5-VL-7B-INSTRUCT as the backbone for question and visual option generation, including LLAMA3.2-11B-VISION (Grattafiori et al., 2024), LLAVA (Lu et al., 2022), INSTRUCTBLIP (Dai et al., 2023), MPLUG-OWL (Ye et al., 2024), and VISUALGLM-6B (Du et al., 2022). Note that we employ the same prompt for all base models to en- sure fairness in the comparison. As summarized in Table 9, QWEN2.5-VL-7B-INSTRUCT outper- forms all the rest base models, showcasing its high applicability and suitability in our framework. Gen- erally, while there are slight difference in perfor- mance among the 6 base models, they consistently demonstrate superior performance in both question and visual option generation, which further con- firms the effectiveness and versatility of our CmOS framework.

    "Answering the Unanswerable Is to Err Knowingly: Analyzing and Mitigating Abstention Failures in Large Reasoning Models Yi Liu1, Xiangyu Liu1, Zequn Sun1, Wei Hu1,2,* 1 State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, China 2 National Institute of Healthcare Data Science, Nanjing University, China {yiliu07, xyl}.nju@gmail.com, {sunzq, whu}@nju.edu.cn Abstract Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown remarkable progress on complex reasoning tasks. However, some ques- tions posed to LRMs are inherently unanswerable, such as math problems lacking sufficient conditions. We find that LRMs continually fail to provide appropriate abstentions when confronted with these unanswerable questions. In this paper, we systematically analyze, investigate, and resolve this issue for trustworthy AI. We first conduct a detailed analysis of the distinct response behaviors of LRMs when facing unanswer- able questions. Then, we show that LRMs possess sufficient cognitive capabilities to recognize the flaws in these questions. However, they fail to exhibit appropriate abstention behav- ior, revealing a misalignment between their internal cognition and external response. Finally, to resolve this issue, we pro- pose a lightweight, two-stage method that combines cognitive monitoring with inference-time intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the abstention rate while maintaining the overall reasoning performance. 1 Introduction Large reasoning models (LRMs), such as GPT-o1 (Jaech et al. 2024) and DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al. 2025), have demonstrated strong performance on complex reasoning tasks (Xu et al. 2025). By introducing the concept of \u201cthought\u201d and generating longer chains of thought (CoT), LRMs are able to explore diverse reasoning paths while spontaneously reflecting and correcting errors. This enables LRMs to tackle complex tasks with greater depth and flexibility, which is particularly valuable in high-stakes reasoning scenarios. Most current research on LRMs focuses on improving the reasoning process for solving complex problems (Xu et al. 2025), such as reducing redundant reasoning steps to alleviate overthinking (Dang, Huang, and Chen 2025; Yang et al. 2025b) and refining the reasoning process to further enhance reasoning performance (Chen et al. 2025; Liao et al. 2025). However, limited work has considered that not all complex questions are answerable (Kirichenko et al. 2025; Song, Shi, and Zhao 2025). When confronted with noisy and diverse user queries, there will always be cases where LRMs are unable to produce reliable responses, such as the math problems missing sufficient conditions. *Corresponding author The operation \u2297is used to combine two nonzero numbers by a \u2297b = a\u00b2/b.

So, the left side is 1 \u22972 = 3, then 3 \u22973 = 6. The right side is 2 \u22973 = 5, then 1 \u22975 = 6. So, the final answer is 6 - 6 = 0. </think> The final answer is 0. <think> Okay, I need to evaluate [(1 \u22972) \u22973] - [1 \u2297(2 \u22973)], but I don\u2019t know what \u2297actually does.

There\u2019s not enough information to solve the problem. The final answer is \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. Abstention success Abstention failure missing Hallucinated answer Figure 1: Examples of abstention failure and success for LRMs on unanswerable questions. As illustrated in Figure 1, when a question is unanswer- able due to missing necessary conditions, we prefer LRMs to reason about why it cannot be answered and have the ability to abstain by responding with \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d (i.e., ab- stention success), rather than generating a reasoning process with hallucination and arriving at an incorrect answer (i.e., abstention failure). Since model reliability is foundational to user trust, LRMs need to possess both strong reasoning abilities and the capacity to abstain from answering unan- swerable questions (Kirichenko et al. 2025; Song, Shi, and Zhao 2025). We first validate the phenomenon that LRMs often struggle to abstain. As shown in Figure 2, we evaluate several LRMs on SUM (Song, Shi, and Zhao 2025), which contains mathematical unanswerable questions. Our results show that most LRMs fail to abstain on more than half of the examples. To address the above issue, we systematically analyze, investigate, and propose solutions to improve the abstention behavior for LRMs. First, to understand how LRMs fail to abstain, we analyze three types of responses generated by LRMs when faced with unanswerable questions. We find that LRMs exhibit two types of behavior when they fail to abstain. Further, we explore their awareness of unanswerable questions. We conduct anal- ysis on LRMs at both external level (intermediate responses during reasoning) and internal level (latent representations). arXiv:2508.18760v1 [cs.AI] 26 Aug 2025 17.9 22.4 35.0 45.2 52.5 82.1 77.6 65.0 54.8 47.5 0 20 40 60 80 100 R1-Distill-Llama-8B R1-Distill-Qwen-7B R1-Distill-Qwen-14B Qwen3-8B Qwen3-14B Abstention success Abstention failure Figure 2: Abstention performance comparison of different LRMs for unanswerable questions on the SUM dataset.

We find that LRMs possess sufficient cognitive capabilities to recognize flaws in such questions. This reveals a misalign- ment between internal cognition and external output: a LRM internally realizes that a question is unanswerable, yet still fails to act on this realization and abstain accordingly. An- swering the unanswerable is to err knowingly. Second, we seek to improve the abstention ability of LRMs for unanswerable questions. Our further analysis shows that although LRMs may internally exhibit a tendency to ab- stain during reasoning, such signals are generally not strong enough to interrupt reasoning and result in abstention. Based on this insight, we propose a method that combines cognitive monitoring with inference-time intervention, aiming to im- prove LRMs\u2019 ability to abstain from unanswerable questions while preserving their reasoning abilities on answerable ones. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments with two datasets using LRMs from various model families and scales. Our method enhances LRMs\u2019 ability to abstain from answer- ing unanswerable questions without degrading their reason- ing on answerable ones. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that different types of abstention failures benefit from differ- ent intervention strategies. Our method achieves significant improvements across all failure types. We will open-source our code to facilitate future research. 2 Related Work LLM Abstention on Unanswerable Questions. As the demand for more reliable language models grows, the ability of LLMs to abstain from answering unanswerable questions has become an important evaluation criterion (Yin et al. 2023; Amayuelas et al. 2024; Madhusudhan et al. 2025; Sun et al. 2024; Tomani et al. 2024). LRMs have attracted attention for their strong performance on reasoning tasks (Yang et al. 2025b; Fu et al. 2025). However, their behavior on unanswer- able questions has been less studied. Prior work (Kirichenko et al. 2025; Song, Shi, and Zhao 2025) finds that LRMs show weaker abstention ability. In our work, we further provide a more detailed analysis of the different types of outputs pro- duced by LRMs when faced with unanswerable questions. We show that LRMs often have an internal understanding of a problem\u2019s solvability but fail to express it through explicit abstention. Based on this insight, we propose a method to improve their abstention behavior. Inference-Time Improvements for LRMs. While LRMs benefit from richer chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and achieve strong performance on complex tasks, recent efforts have explored inference-time interventions to further enhance their reasoning accuracy and efficiency (Chen et al. 2025; Dang, Huang, and",

Inference-Time Improvements for LRMs. While LRMs benefit from richer chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and achieve strong performance on complex tasks, recent efforts have explored inference-time interventions to further enhance their reasoning accuracy and efficiency (Chen et al. 2025; Dang, Huang, and Chen 2025). For example, (Fu et al. 2025) and (Li et al. 2024) monitor intermediate consistency be- tween reasoning steps to decide when to output the answer. (Yang et al. 2025b) estimates confidence in intermediate steps to decide whether the model has reached a sufficiently certain conclusion. (Liao et al. 2025) uses process-level reward mod- els to guide the model toward better reasoning trajectories. However, the above methods are designed for answerable questions. In our work, we evaluate their effectiveness on unanswerable questions and propose a new inference-time intervention to improve the abstention capability for LRMs. 3 Analysis of Abstention Failure In this section, we begin by analyzing how LRMs respond to unanswerable math problems. We then investigate LRMs\u2019 awareness of unanswerable questions by examining whether they possess the ability to recognize the unanswerability of such questions, from both internal and external perspectives. LRMs. We evaluate five LRMs across diverse model fam- ilies and scales, including R1-Distill-Llama-8B, R1-Distill- Qwen-7B, R1-Distill-Qwen-14B (DeepSeek-AI et al. 2025), Qwen3-8B, and Qwen3-14B (Yang et al. 2025a). Datasets. Following previous work (Song, Shi, and Zhao 2025; Ouyang 2025), we focus on unanswerable math prob- lems, i.e., ill-posed problems that are challenging for LRMs and offer objectively defined criteria for unanswerability. Specifically, we use the Synthetic Unanswerable Math (SUM) (Song, Shi, and Zhao 2025) dataset, which includes diverse problems from AIME (1984\u20132023), AMC (pre-2023), Omni- MATH (Gao et al. 2025), and Still (Team 2025). The unan- swerable problems in SUM are generated based on five crite- ria: (1) key information deletion, (2) ambiguous key informa- tion, (3) unrealistic conditions, (4) unrelated objects, and (5) question deletion. We randomly sample 1,000 problems for our analysis. For each unanswerable case, we use GPT-4o to generate a brief explanation as the ground-truth rationale. Objective and Prompt. Given a question, we encourage the LRM to perform normal reasoning when the question is answerable, and to respond with \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d along with a corresponding explanation when it is not (i.e., correct abstention). The prompt used in this task is shown in Figure 3. {Question} Let\u2019s think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}. Please solve the problem strictly based on the information provided. Do not introduce any additional assumptions.

As illustrated in Figure 4, the LRM infers a $9.99 handling charge that is never men- tioned in the input in order to compute a final answer. \u2022 Cognitive fixation: The LRM fails to reach a conclusion within the token limit. It often enters a prolonged reason- ing process, stubbornly reformulating or pursuing invalid solution paths without terminating the response, even after recognizing the question is unanswerable. Figure 5 shows the response type distribution. As model ca- pacity increases, the proportion of correct abstention tends to rise, while those of hallucinated answer and cognitive fixation decrease. A substantial portion of unanswerable questions do not receive correct abstentions.

Our two-layered analysis assesses (1) be- havioral signals: whether LRMs outwardly indicate question answerability, and (2) latent signals: whether answerability is internally encoded during reasoning. Behavioral Signals of Question Answerability. Inspired by prior work (Yang et al. 2025b; Chen et al. 2025; Wang et al. 2025) showing that LRMs form and revise intermediate conclusions during reasoning, we insert stopping points into the reasoning trajectory. At each stopping point, we prompt the LRM to (1) directly provide an answer, and (2) to explain why the question is unanswerable (details in the appendix). We apply this intervention to the two failure types. For \u201ccognitive fixation\u201d, we use the keyword \u201cwait\u201d as a stopping point and prompt the model to directly output its answer. For \u201challucinated answer\u201d, which typically have shorter reasoning trajectories, we use \u201c\\n\\n\u201d as the stopping point. We",

For \u201ccognitive fixation\u201d, we use the keyword \u201cwait\u201d as a stopping point and prompt the model to directly output its answer. For \u201challucinated answer\u201d, which typically have shorter reasoning trajectories, we use \u201c\\n\\n\u201d as the stopping point. We then compute the proportion of questions in each category where the model can respond with a correct abstention at stopping points. As shown in Figure 6, for cognitive fixation, more than half of the cases can result in correct abstentions. A notable portion of hallucinated answer cases receive correct abstentions, and the rate improves as model size increases. Since \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d is a simple response and may be produced randomly, we additionally prompt the LRMs at each stopping point to explain why the question is unanswer- able, to better assess their awareness of unanswerability. We measure the percentage of questions in each category with correct explanations. Figure 7 shows that both failure types 0.850 0.800 0.750 0.700 5% 15% 25% 35% 45% 55% 65% 75% 85% 95% Percentage of reasoning process Acc. of un/answerable questions Qwen3-14B R1-Distill-Llama-8B R1-Distill-Qwen-7B R1-Distill-Qwen-14B Qwen3-8B Figure 8: Classification accuracy of answerable and unan- swerable questions at varying stages of the reasoning process. yield high percentages of correct explanations. These findings suggest that even when an LRM fails to ab- stain, it may still recognize unanswerability during reasoning. Its ability to assess answerability exists but is underused in final decisions. Latent Signals of Question Answerability. We conduct a probing-based analysis on the latent representations dur- ing reasoning. The linear representation hypothesis posits that high-level concepts, such as language, gender, and truth- fulness, are linearly embedded in the latent space of LLMs (Park, Choe, and Veitch 2024). We hypothesize that question answerability may also be linearly represented during the reasoning process. Inspired by prior work on representation probing (Li et al. 2023; Orgad et al. 2025; Marks and Tegmark 2023; Slobodkin et al. 2023), we train lightweight linear clas- sifiers (probes) on hidden activations from the LRMs\u2019 reason- ing trajectory. The goal is to assess whether answerable and unanswerable questions can be distinguished from latent rep- resentations during the reasoning process, thereby revealing the presence of answerability-related signals in internal state. We use the output of the multi-head attention before the residual connection as the input to the probe (Li et al. 2023): xc l = H X h=1 Qh l Atth l (P h l xl), (1) where xl is the input of layer l, P h l projects the input into a head-specific subspace, Qh l maps it back, Att is the attention operator. The probe is defined as a simple linear classifier: p\u03b8(xc",
    "H X h=1 Qh l Atth l (P h l xl), (1) where xl is the input of layer l, P h l projects the input into a head-specific subspace, Qh l maps it back, Att is the attention operator. The probe is defined as a simple linear classifier: p\u03b8(xc l ) = \u03c3(\u27e8\u03b8, xc l \u27e9), where \u03b8 is the trainable weight and \u03c3 denotes the sigmoid function. One probe is trained per layer. We sample 2,200 pairs of answerable and unanswerable questions from the SUM dataset (2,000 pairs for training and 200 for validation). For each question, we randomly sample 1,000 token-level activations xc l from the reasoning trajectory, and construct a dataset \b (xc l , y)i N i=1, where y \u2208 {0, 1} indicates question answerability. At inference time, we aggregate the prediction probabilities across all tokens up to the current reasoning step and use the average as the overall answerability prediction. We select the optimal probing layer for each model based on the validation set, and evaluate on the test dataset used for analysis in the previous section. The results are shown in Figure 8, where we plot the probe\u2019s classification accuracy at various percentages of the 86.86 84.65 88.24 92.55 94.76 73.93 75.15 80.34 83.84 85.09 73.81 70.12 75.33 79.62 82.61 40 60 80 100 R1-Distill-Llama-8B R1-Distill-Qwen-7B R1-Distill-Qwen-14B Qwen3-8B Qwen3-14B Correct abstention Hallucinated answer Cognitive fixation Abstention confidence Figure 9: The confidence of abstention answer: \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d in different types of response. 70.05 71.22 78.93 79.89 86.95 7.8 5.86 36.6 14.31 18.23 23.47 10.18 27.81 11.39 15.15 0 20 40 60 80 100 R1-Distill-Llama-8B R1-Distill-Qwen-7B R1-Distill-Qwen-14B Qwen3-8B Qwen3-14B Correct abstention Hallucinated answer Cognitive fixation Abstention frequency Figure 10: The frequency of abstention responses across stopping points in different types of response outcomes. reasoning process, using a 0.5 threshold to distinguish unan- swerable (prediction probability of probe > 0.5) from an- swerable cases. For all LRMs, we observe that the probe\u2019s classification accuracy increases steadily as reasoning pro- gresses, with most accuracies exceeding 0.8 by the end of the trajectory. These results suggest that signals related to ques- tion answerability are indeed encoded in the representations of LRMs during reasoning. Although these signals may not always be reflected in the LRMs\u2019 final output behavior, they are implicitly present in the internal computation process. 4 Mitigation of Abstention Failure In this section, we seek to mitigate abstention failures of LRMs when faced with unanswerable questions. 4.1 Motivation As previously discussed, although LRMs show signs of recog- nizing unanswerable questions during reasoning, they often fail to abstain in their final answers.

    "mitigate abstention failures of LRMs when faced with unanswerable questions. 4.1 Motivation As previously discussed, although LRMs show signs of recog- nizing unanswerable questions during reasoning, they often fail to abstain in their final answers. We aim to identify the causes of this misalignment and explore ways to fix it. First, we examine the LRMs\u2019 confidence (Kuhn, Gal, and Farquhar 2023) in abstaining at the stopping point across three output types. We sample an equal number of questions from each output type and compute the average confidence in generating \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d at the stopping points. Following (Yang et al. 2025b), the confidence score C is computed as p(at) = P(at | H, I, a<t), C = n X i=1 max at\u2208V p(at) ! 1 n , (2) where p(at) denotes the model\u2019s predicted probability of answer token at, H includes the input prompt and the gen- erated thoughts, I is the prompt used to elicit the answer, n is the number of decoding steps, and V is the vocabulary.

All the findings suggest that while the LRM may recognize a question as unanswerable, it often lacks sufficient confi- dence to act upon it. The gap between internal awareness and output behavior reveals a key misalignment in LRMs: though they may be aware of unanswerability, their decision process remains biased toward answering rather than abstaining. 4.2 Method Motivated by the above findings, we propose a method to help LRMs improve their abstention capability. It consists of two key components: cognitive monitoring and inference- time intervention. The goal is to monitor the LRM\u2019s evolving recognition of question unanswerability during reasoning, and to intervene when necessary to guide the LRM toward making an abstention by encouraging abstention behaviors. Cognitive Monitoring. The first step of our method aims to identify when the model internally recognizes that a ques- tion may be unanswerable. To do so, we track the token-level hidden states generated during inference and segment the rea- soning process into semantically coherent units (e.g., clauses or transitions marked by discourse cues such as \u201cwait\u201d). At the end of each segment, we apply a lightweight linear probe, which is trained from our analysis of latent signals of ques- tion answerability, to estimate the probability that the current question is unanswerable. If the predicted probability of unan- swerability exceeds a threshold, the model transitions to the next stage: inference-time intervention. Instruction:\\n You are not permitted to make assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the question. There are signs that this question may lack sufficient information to answer definitively. If you find that any part of your reasoning depends on undefined operations, missing values, or unspecified conditions, you must immediately stop and output: \\boxed{I don't know.} Do not attempt to guess, infer, or continue reasoning with incomplete information. This is a strict constraint! \\n</think>\\n\\n Intervention Prompt Figure 11: The prompt used for inference-time intervention. Inference-Time Intervention.

    "know.} Do not attempt to guess, infer, or continue reasoning with incomplete information. This is a strict constraint! \\n</think>\\n\\n Intervention Prompt Figure 11: The prompt used for inference-time intervention. Inference-Time Intervention. Once the LRM exhibits suf- ficient internal evidence that a question is unanswerable, we intervene the reasoning process to reinforce this recognition and increase the likelihood of a correct abstention. The inter- vention is implemented via an instructional guidance prompt (see Figure 11). We append a prompt that restates the possibil- ity that the question may be unanswerable, helping the LRM overcome cognitive fixation and avoid speculative guesses based on missing or unstated information. Inspired by prior work (Yang et al. 2025b; Fu et al. 2025), we also incorporate an early exit strategy to prevent unnecessary continuation of reasoning. It is designed to be minimally intrusive yet seman- tically salient, encouraging the model to consider abstention as a valid and even preferred option under certain conditions. 5 Experiments 5.1 Setup Datasets.

UMWP is derived from four widely used math word problem datasets: SVAMP (Patel, Bhat- tamishra, and Goyal 2021), MultiArith (Koncel-Kedziorski et al. 2016), GSM8K (Cobbe et al. 2021), and ASDiv (Miao, Liang, and Su 2020). The full dataset consists of 5,200 in- stances. We sample 600 questions (300 unanswerable and 300 answerable) to form the test set. For the unanswerable questions in UMWP, we also use GPT-4o to generate the reasoning behind their unanswerability as ground truth. Metrics. Following previous works (Song, Shi, and Zhao 2025; Kirichenko et al. 2025), we evaluate model perfor- mance using the following metrics. (1) Abstention Rate: The proportion of unanswerable questions for which the model correctly abstains from answering by outputting \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d in accordance with the instruction. (2) Reason Accu- racy: The percentage of unanswerable questions for which the model provides the correct rationale for unanswerability. (3) Token Usage: The number of tokens generated by the model during the reasoning process. (4) Answer Accuracy: The proportion of answerable questions for which the model produces the correct final answer. Baselines and LRMs. Our method is an inference-time intervention for LRMs without training. There are no directly comparable baselines. We select two baselines based on out- put consistency (Dynasor-CoT) and confidence (DEER), as- suming that correct abstention is the correct answer for unan- swerable questions. Dynasor-CoT (Fu et al. 2025) prompts intermediate answers and halts when the same answer ap- pears three times consecutively. DEER (Yang et al. 2025b) monitors sentence-level confidence and exits early once a threshold is met. Besides, the Vanilla method denotes un- altered LRM outputs. For LRMs, we choose five models: R1-Distill-Llama-8B, R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, R1-Distill-Qwen- 14B, Qwen3-8B, and Qwen3-14B. Implementation details and full results for all datasets and LRMs are in the appendix. 5.2 Main Results Table 1 shows the main results. We have the following obser- vations: (1) Our method achieves the highest Abstention Rate and Reason Accuracy on unanswerable questions, demon- strating its strong ability to guide LRMs in recognizing and abstaining from unanswerable inputs. (2) Our method main- tains comparable Answer Accuracy on answerable questions. In most settings, accuracy remains close to the vanilla model and sometimes improves slightly, indicating minimal impact on solving answerable tasks. (3) Our method can reduce token usage on unanswerable questions, with an average reduction of 30\u201350% across different LRMs compared to the vanilla model. It also slightly decreases token consumption on an- swerable questions, indicating improved reasoning efficiency. (4) We observe a positive correlation between Abstention Rate and Reason Accuracy: as the LRM becomes better at ab- staining from unanswerable questions, it also produces more accurate explanations. This suggests that the intervention not only changes the final output but also",
    "on an- swerable questions, indicating improved reasoning efficiency. (4) We observe a positive correlation between Abstention Rate and Reason Accuracy: as the LRM becomes better at ab- staining from unanswerable questions, it also produces more accurate explanations. This suggests that the intervention not only changes the final output but also improves intermedi- ate reasoning quality. (5) Qwen3 models generally outper- form distillation-based models in abstention-related metrics. Larger LRMs tend to exhibit stronger abstention capabilities. This trend indicates that both model scale and architecture contribute to reliable unanswerability detection. 5.3 Further Discussions Impact on Response Type Distribution. We analyze the changes in the proportions of different response types across methods and datasets, as shown in Figure 12. Our method consistently reduces the hallucinated answers and cognitive fixation outputs. This reduction directly contributes to a sub- stantial increase in the rate of correct abstentions. While both Dynasor-CoT and DEER employ early-exit strategies to miti- gate cognitive fixation, we observe that such baselines often lead to a higher proportion of hallucinated answers. Early exits without appropriate guidance may cause the model to make up assumptions or imagined scenarios for giving a definite answer, rather than acknowledging uncertainty. This highlights the importance of combining monitoring with guided intervention to steer LRMs toward proper behavior. Intervention Effects. We assess how our intervention in- fluences the LRM\u2019s confidence in abstention and its actual abstention behavior, in order to evaluate whether our method Method SUM UMWP Abst. conf.

Specifically, at the intervention point identified by our method, we prompt the LRM to generate intermedi- ate outputs both before and after the intervention. We then measure two key indicators: the confidence when producing \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d responses, and the proportion of questions for which the model outputs \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. The results are shown in Table 2. Our method consistently enhances the con- fidence in generating abstention responses. In addition, the abstention rate also shows corresponding improvements.

We further analyze the cognitive monitoring component of our method and compare our default monitoring strategy based on latent representations with alternative strategies relying on behav- ioral signals. The behavioral signal approach monitors the LRMs\u2019 intermediate outputs at the end of the paragraph gen- eration phase (e.g., when it reaches a \u201cwait\u201d token), and uses these outputs to determine whether to trigger an intervention. We investigate three variants: The Direct Behavior strategy checks whether the model\u2019s intermediate output is \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d and triggers an intervention immediately if so. The Consistency strategy triggers intervention only if the model produces \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d in three consecutive intermediate outputs (inspired by Dynasor-CoT). The Confidence Score strategy triggers intervention when the model outputs \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d with a confidence score exceeding a predefined thresh- old (inspired by DEER). As shown in Table 3, all monitoring strategies contribute to the improvement in abstention behav- ior, showing that cognitive monitoring is generally effective. Among them, the strategy based on latent representation sig- nals achieves the best and most consistent performance across different models and datasets. The Direct Behavior method is simple and works well, but it can be too aggressive and may hurt performance on answerable questions. Ablation Study. We evaluate two aspects of inference-time intervention: the instructional guidance prompt and the early exit strategy. By removing one component at a time, we ana- lyze how each affects abstention behavior and answer quality. The results are shown in Table 4. For correct abstention, the impact of instructional guidance is greater than that of early exit. The early exit strategy helps reduce the number of cogni- tive fixation cases. However, without instructional guidance, the proportion of hallucinated answers increases. This again Monitoring Signal Unanswerable Ans.

Instruc- tional guidance also has a slight impact on the performance of answerable questions. 6 Conclusion and future work In this paper, we investigate the failure of LRMs to abstain from answering unanswerable questions, despite having the cognitive ability to detect the unanswerability. We identify a misalignment between the model\u2019s internal cognition and its external response behavior. We propose a lightweight, two-stage method that significantly improves abstention be- havior without harming reasoning performance. Future work aims to explore training-time alignment strategies to improve abstention fidelity. References Amayuelas, A.; Wong, K.; Pan, L.; Chen, W.; and Wang, W. Y. 2024.

Do Large Language Models Know What They Don\u2019t Know? In ACL (Findings), 8653\u20138665. Association for Com- putational Linguistics. A Evaluation Details A.1 Evaluation Details of Three Response Types In this section, we provide detailed criteria for evaluating the three types of responses introduced in Section 3.1: cor- rect abstention, hallucinated answer, and cognitive fixation. These evaluations are based on model outputs generated in response to an input prompt shown in Figure 3. The criteria are designed for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Correct abstention A model response is considered a cor- rect abstention if it satisfies the following conditions: 1. The model terminates its reasoning process, indicated by the inclusion of the \u201c</think>\u201d keyword in the output. 2. The model either explicitly includes the phrase \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d in the answer, or provides an explanation in the format of \u201cReason {}\u201d indicating that the question is unanswerable. Hallucinated answer A model response is labeled as a hallucinated answer if: 1. The model ends its reasoning process by including the \u201c</think>\u201d keyword. 2. The model presents a final answer using the \u201c\\boxed{}\u201d format, where the answer is not \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d, and no accompanying \u201cReason {}\u201d is given to indicate that the question is unanswerable. Cognitive fixation A model response is labeled as a cogni- tive fixation if, under a token budget of 10,000 tokens: 1. The model fails to produce the \u201c</think>\u201d keyword to terminate its reasoning process. 2. It does not provide a final answer using the \u201c\\boxed{}\u201d format, nor does it offer an unanswerability explanation in the \u201cReason {}\u201d format. A.2 Evaluation Details of Metrics This section provides detailed descriptions of the evaluation metrics introduced in Section 5 of the main text. Abstention rate The proportion of questions that receive the correct abstention among all questions. The criteria for determining a correct abstention are described in Section A.1 of Appendix. Reason accuracy The percentage of unanswerable ques- tions for which the model provides the correct rationale for unanswerability. We use the Qwen3-32B model to perform the evaluation, with the judgment prompt shown in Figure 13. I will give you two explanations for why a math problem is unsolvable: 1.Gold-standard Reason: The correct explanation for why the problem is unsolvable. 2.Model's Reason: An explanation generated by a model for why the same problem is unsolvable. Your task is to: Compare the model's reason with the gold-standard reason. Determine whether the model's reason is: Correct: if it captures the same core idea, even if the wording is different or it's only partially",
    "Reason: An explanation generated by a model for why the same problem is unsolvable. Your task is to: Compare the model's reason with the gold-standard reason. Determine whether the model's reason is: Correct: if it captures the same core idea, even if the wording is different or it's only partially complete. Incorrect: if it misses the key point or gives a wrong explanation. Output Requirement: You must respond only with a JSON object in one of the following two formats (no extra text):{\"result\": Correct} or {\"result\": Incorrect}. Do not include any other text or explanations in your response. Gold-standard Reason:{gold-standard reason} Model's Reason:{model_reason}. Your output is: Prompt for Reason Accuracy Figure 13: Prompt used for reason accuracy. You are a mathematics assistant. Your primary task is to determine whether two given mathematical expressions or answers are mathematically equivalent, disregarding differences in symbolic notation, LaTeX syntax, or formatting. Focus strictly on whether the two expressions represent the same mathematical object, value, or solution. Please consider the following two answer expressions: 1. {answer1} 2. {answer2} Do these two expressions represent the same mathematical object or value? If they are equivalent, return True; otherwise, return False. Please return the result strictly in the following JSON format: If they are equivalent, return: {\"equivalent\": True} If they are not equivalent, return: {\"equivalent\": False} Prompt for Answer Accuracy Figure 14: Prompt used for answer accuracy. Answer accuracy The proportion of answerable questions for which the model produces the correct final answer. We use the more capable Qwen3-32B model to perform the evalu- ation, with the specific judgment prompt shown in Figure 14. B Implementation Details about Experiments For the baselines, we select two methods base on output consistency (Dynasor-CoT) (Fu et al. 2025) and confidence (DEER) (Yang et al. 2025b). All the baselines and our method are intervention-based methods during the reasoning process. We use the keyword \u201cwait\u201d as a universal stopping token to trigger the intervention across all methods. The prompt used to elicit the intermediate answer at the stopping point is: \u201c\\n **Final Answer**\\n\\boxed{\u201d. For Dynasor-CoT, we prompt intermediate answers and terminate the reasoning process early when the same answer appears three times con- secutively. For DEER, we prompt intermediate answers and terminate the reasoning process early when the confidence of the answer exceeds a predefined threshold (set to 0.95 following the original paper). Our method consists of two main components. For Cogni- tive Monitoring, we train a lightweight linear probe on 2,000 pairs of answerable and unanswerable questions sampled from the SUM dataset (Song, Shi, and Zhao 2025), and vali- date it on an additional 200 pairs. For the reasoning process of each question, we sample 1,000 token-level activations as input to the",
    "Monitoring, we train a lightweight linear probe on 2,000 pairs of answerable and unanswerable questions sampled from the SUM dataset (Song, Shi, and Zhao 2025), and vali- date it on an additional 200 pairs. For the reasoning process of each question, we sample 1,000 token-level activations as input to the probe. The linear probe is trained for 75 epochs with a batch size of 16,384 and a learning rate of 3e-5 (Li et al. 2023). We evaluate the classification performance of the probe using the full reasoning process on both the SUM and UMWP test sets. The results are shown in Table 5, where the F1 score is computed with a threshold of 0.5. The results demonstrate that the probe achieves good classification per- formance and generalizes well across datasets. In our method, the probe is used to predict the answerability of a question based on the generated reasoning content during the infer- ence process. A question is predicted as unanswerable when the probe\u2019s output exceeds a threshold t. We set t = 0.6 for the SUM dataset and t = 0.5 for the UMWP dataset. C Full Results for Further Discussions Impact on Response Type Distribution. We analyze the changes in the proportions of different response types for different methods across all LRMs and datasets, as shown LRMs Best Layer SUM UMWP AUROC F1 AUROC F1 R1-Distill-Llama-8B 22 0.879 0.816 0.871 0.809 R1-Distill-Qwen-7B 17 0.912 0.840 0.926 0.867 R1-Distill-Qwen-14B 30 0.908 0.828 0.930 0.879 Qwen3-8B 24 0.925 0.857 0.967 0.919 Qwen3-14B 26 0.936 0.874 0.970 0.918 Table 5: Classification performance of the probe across dif- ferent LRMs on the SUM and UMWP datasets. in Figure 15. The results are consistent with those presented in Section 5.3 of the main text. Our method consistently re- duces the hallucinated answers and cognitive fixation outputs. This reduction directly contributes to a substantial increase in the rate of correct abstentions. While both Dynasor-CoT and DEER employ early-exit strategies to mitigate cognitive fixation, we observe that such baselines often lead to a higher proportion of hallucinated answers. Early exits without appro- priate guidance may cause the model to make up assumptions or imagined scenarios for giving a definite answer, rather than acknowledging uncertainty. This highlights the importance of combining monitoring with guided intervention to steer LRMs toward proper behavior. Intervention Effects. We assess how our intervention in- fluences the LRM\u2019s confidence in abstention and its actual abstention behavior, in order to evaluate whether our method helps bridge the gap between cognitive awareness and absten- tion behavior. Specifically, at the intervention point identified by our method, we prompt the LRM to generate intermediate outputs both before and after the intervention. We then mea- sure two",
    "its actual abstention behavior, in order to evaluate whether our method helps bridge the gap between cognitive awareness and absten- tion behavior. Specifically, at the intervention point identified by our method, we prompt the LRM to generate intermediate outputs both before and after the intervention. We then mea- sure two key indicators: the confidence when producing \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d responses, and the proportion of questions for which the model outputs \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. The results across all LRMs and datasets are shown in Table 6. The results are consistent with those presented in Section 5.3 of the main text. Our method consistently enhances the confidence in generating abstention responses. In addition, the abstention rate also shows corresponding improvements. Further Analysis of Cognitive Monitoring. We analyze the cognitive monitoring component of our method and com- pare our default monitoring strategy based on latent repre- sentations with alternative strategies relying on behavioral signals. The behavioral signal approach monitors the LRMs\u2019 intermediate outputs at the end of the paragraph generation phase (e.g., when it reaches a \u201cwait\u201d token), and uses these outputs to determine whether to trigger an intervention. We in- vestigate three variants: The \u201cdirect behavior\u201d strategy checks whether the model\u2019s intermediate output is \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d and triggers an intervention immediately if so. The \u201ccon- sistency\u201d strategy triggers intervention only if the model produces \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d in three consecutive intermediate outputs (inspired by Dynasor-CoT). The \u201cconfidence score\u201d strategy triggers intervention when the model outputs \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d with a confidence score exceeding a predefined thresh- old of 0.95 (inspired by DEER).

The results are consistent with those presented in Section 5.3 of the main text. All monitoring strategies contribute to the improvement in abstention behav- ior, showing that cognitive monitoring is generally effective. Among them, the strategy based on latent representation sig- nals achieves the best and most consistent performance across different models and datasets. The direct behavior method is simple and works well, but it can be too aggressive and may hurt performance on answerable questions. Ablation Study. We evaluate two aspects of inference-time intervention: the instructional guidance prompt and the early exit strategy. By removing one component at a time, we analyze how each affects abstention behavior and answer quality. The results, shown in Table 8, are consistent with those presented in Section 5.3",

By removing one component at a time, we analyze how each affects abstention behavior and answer quality. The results, shown in Table 8, are consistent with those presented in Section 5.3 of the main text. For correct abstention, the impact of instructional guidance is greater than that of early exit. The early exit strategy helps reduce the number of cognitive fixation cases. However, without instructional guidance, the proportion of hallucinated answers increases.

Text-to-SQL approaches have shown promising performance on benchmark data; however, they inherit SQL\u2019s drawbacks, including inefficiency with large datasets and limited support for complex data analyses beyond basic querying. We propose a novel framework that transforms natural language queries into query plans. Our solution is implemented outside tra- ditional databases, allowing us to support classical SQL commands while avoiding SQL\u2019s inherent limitations. Additionally, we en- able complex analytical functions, such as principal component analysis and anomaly detection, providing greater flexibility and extensibility than traditional SQL capabilities. We leverage LLMs to iteratively interpret queries and construct operation sequences, addressing computational complexity by incrementally building so- lutions. By executing operations directly on the data, we overcome context length limitations without requiring the entire dataset to be processed by the model. We validate our framework through experiments on both standard databases and large scientific tables, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling extensive datasets and performing sophisticated data analyses.

    "ACM. ACM ISBN 978-1-4503-XXXX-X/18/06...$15.00 https://doi.org/XXXXXXX.XXXXXXX 1 INTRODUCTION Tabular data is widely used for storing information. It plays a crucial role in data analytics in various fields such as finance, healthcare, scientific research, manufacturing and general business process management. With a two-dimensional representation format, tabu- lar data makes it easy for users to manage structured information, enabling complex data analysis and insight extraction methods to be built on it. Complex data analytics require efficient data query and retrieval. Structured Query Language (SQL) is the standard for interacting with tables in relational databases. It allows users to perform operations like filtering, joining, and aggregating data with the support of underlying relational algebra. However, SQL has sev- eral disadvantages. First, it is not easily accessible to non-technical users, requiring knowledge of specific syntax and query structures. Second, SQL struggles to handle large datasets efficiently, especially when dealing with super-large tables that exceed database limita- tions. Complex partitioning and mapping are often required to sup- port SQL executions on partitioned or distributed tables [3, 10, 27]. Third, SQL supports limited operations and cannot perform com- plex data analyses such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), anomaly detection, or advanced pattern recognition. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the approach of feeding the entire table into the LLM and generating answers to natural language queries [17, 31]. However, this method encounters significant challenges due to the limited context length of LLMs. To address these context limitations, one solution for table querying relies on compressing or truncating large tables to fit the context limits of the models [19]. These methods, however, often result in incomplete analyses and performance degradation, espe- cially when working with complex datasets that contain thousands of columns and rows. Moreover, even with efforts to compress input content or increase token limits, LLMs cannot effectively handle large tables, as they exceed the models\u2019 maximum input size [4, 5, 25]. There are efforts to use Text-to-SQL to address the problem, but many early work [2] were not widely used due to the difficulty of understanding natural language [12]. As an alternative, researchers have explored LLM-based methods [7, 8, 14, 22] by providing only the table schema to the LLM. The model generates SQL queries that can be executed on the database according to the schema. This approach significantly alleviates the token limitation problem and has demonstrated good performance in recent studies. However, it still inherits SQL\u2019s inherent disadvantages: inefficiency with large arXiv:2508.18758v1 [cs.DB] 26 Aug 2025 Conference acronym \u2019XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Yipeng Zhang, Chen Wang, Yuzhe Zhang, and Jacky Jiang datasets and inability to perform complex data analyses beyond basic querying.

Here we particularly consider those datasets whose schemas do not fit into the context window of LLMs. While some efforts have attempted to teach LLMs to generate code directly or use APIs to overcome these limitations, problems related to scalability, efficiency, and the integration of complex analytical functions remain as a challenge for large-scale databases [16]. While some efforts have attempted to teach LLMs to generate code directly or use APIs to overcome these limitations, problems related to scalability, efficiency, and the integration of complex analytical functions remain as a challenge for large-scale databases [16]. To address the problems, we propose a novel approach that leverages the advantages of SQL while overcoming its limitations. Instead of converting natural language to SQL queries, we directly convert text-based queries to query plans corresponding to SQL-like queries of the text. This provides flexibility to handle large data stored in the form of spreadsheets or CSV form, while remaining compatible with traditional relational databases. We create a set of SQL-like operators, such as selection by conditions, ordering, union, and joining, but implemented outside the constraints of traditional databases. These operators allow us to mimic SQL functionality without being hindered by database limitations or inefficiencies with large datasets, thus addressing the second disadvantage. An- other benefit of generating query plan directly is that operators are extensible and complex analytical functions required for specific tasks, such as dimension reduction, clustering, anomaly detection, and advanced pattern recognition can be easily integrated. This flexibility enables us to perform sophisticated data analyses directly within our framework, effectively solving the third disadvantage. At the core of our approach is the problem of transforming a user\u2019s natural language query into a sequence of operations that re- trieves and processes the relevant data from tabular datasets before returning the final answers to the user query. However, determining the optimal sequence of operations is a computationally challenging task. This problem is analogous to the classical NP-hard planning problem. The complexity arises from the vast number of possible operation sequences and the dependencies between operations. Therefore, it is impractical to exhaustively search for the optimal sequence in polynomial time. To overcome this challenge, we employ an iterative approach that incrementally constructs the operation sequence based on the ReAct prompting framework [28]. By utilizing LLMs, we can understand the user\u2019s question and reason about the most appropriate next steps based on the current state of the data. LLMs are well-suited for this task",
    "challenge, we employ an iterative approach that incrementally constructs the operation sequence based on the ReAct prompting framework [28]. By utilizing LLMs, we can understand the user\u2019s question and reason about the most appropriate next steps based on the current state of the data. LLMs are well-suited for this task due to their capabilities in natural language understanding and in-context learning [6, 9]. At each iteration, the model selects the next operation to apply, and the process continues until the final answer is obtained. In addition, we provide a multi-level table description generation mechanism to scale our method to handle large data tables with thousands of columns. We validate our approach through experiments on both tradi- tional databases, Spider dataset [29]), and large scientific tables, agronomic dataset [21]. The experiments on the Spider dataset demonstrate that our solution performs well on traditional tab- ular data in Table QA tasks, even without utilizing any training data from the dataset, whereas the experiments on the agronomic dataset show that our solution is capable of handling super large tabular data under complex Table QA tasks. 2 RELATED WORK Supporting question-answering on tabular data has drawn increased attention as LLMs become increasingly powerful. Existing approaches can be broadly categorized into two categories: semantic parsing- based methods, and non-SQL-based question answering method- ologies on structured data. 2.1 Semantic Parsing-Based Methods Semantic parsing uses LLMs to transform natural language ques- tions SQLs, and then run SQLs on data tables. Early solutions use encoder-decoder architectures to learn schema linking patterns [26]. With the advent of LLMs, the accuracy of generating SQL has dra- matically improved. These models have been continuously breaking records on benchmarks like Spider [29]. Studies [14, 15, 23, 24, 30] focus on tuning or enhancing language models to improve performance in text-to-SQL tasks. Specifically, Li et al. [15] integrate graph-aware layers with a pre-trained T5 model to handle complex and multi-hop SQL queries, enhancing domain generalization. Li et al. [14] introduce a ranking-enhanced encoding and skeleton-aware decoding framework within a seq2seq model, simplifying schema linking and enhancing SQL parsing. Qi et al. [23] augment a Transformer seq2seq architecture with relation- aware self-attention, improving the model\u2019s capability to manage relational data effectively in text-to-SQL translations. Scholak et al. [24] introduce incremental parsing techniques to constrain the de- coding process of auto-regressive models, ensuring the generation of valid SQL by rejecting inadmissible tokens. Zeng et al. [30] pro- pose a heuristic schema linking algorithm combined with a query plan model to rerank model-generated SQL queries. Despite these advancements, semantic parsing-based methods inherit SQL\u2019s inherent limitations. SQL struggles with large tables due to database systems\u2019 constraints on the number of columns and inefficiencies when handling massive datasets.",
    "[30] pro- pose a heuristic schema linking algorithm combined with a query plan model to rerank model-generated SQL queries. Despite these advancements, semantic parsing-based methods inherit SQL\u2019s inherent limitations. SQL struggles with large tables due to database systems\u2019 constraints on the number of columns and inefficiencies when handling massive datasets. Additionally, SQL lacks support for complex data analyses beyond basic querying. 2.2 Non-SQL approach on structured data There are many methods leveraging LLMs without relying on SQL for tabular data question answering. A naive approach is to feed the entire tabular data as a context directly into an LLM to answer user queries. The performance of this approach subjects to the context length limitation in LLMs. Many existing LLM-based solutions for table querying rely on compressing or truncating large tables to fit the context limits of models. These methods not only reduce the available data but also lead to incomplete analyses and performance degradation, especially when working with tables containing thou- sands of columns and rows [19]. Even worse, studies show that when dealing with large tabular data, the performance drops more than when handling normal textural content [4, 5, 25]. Other methods in this category include the use of code inter- preters and the integration of LLMs with tools based on the ReAct framework [28]. 2.2.1 Code Interpreter Methods. Code interpreter methods enhance the coding abilities of LLMs to generate and execute code for data Text to Query Plans for Question Answering on Large Tables Conference acronym \u2019XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY manipulation tasks. Notable works in this area include: SheetCopi- lot [13] proposes an agent that interprets natural language tasks and controls spreadsheets using a set of atomic actions based on VBA, enabling LLMs to interact robustly with spreadsheet software. Xue et al. [18] introduces a framework where users provide task instructions, and the system generates multiple candidate code snippets, ranks them, and selects the best one to solve the task, it- eratively refining the code for unsolvable rows. Binder [5] presents a neural-symbolic framework that maps task inputs to programs combining SQL and LLM functionalities, using GPT-3 Codex for parsing and execution without task-specific training. Direct code-generation is powerful and flexible for querying tabular data, but also suffers from uncertainty of generation with- out constraints. Troubleshooting is also difficult when results are unexpected. 2.2.2 ReAct with Tools Methods. The ReAct [28] framework in- tegrates LLMs with predefined tools to enhance accessibility and interpretability. Each operation can be easily understood by users, facilitating transparency in the data manipulation process. Struct- GPT [11] proposes an iterative reading-then-reasoning framework where LLMs utilize interfaces to interact with structured data, such as databases and knowledge graphs.

    "predefined tools to enhance accessibility and interpretability. Each operation can be easily understood by users, facilitating transparency in the data manipulation process. Struct- GPT [11] proposes an iterative reading-then-reasoning framework where LLMs utilize interfaces to interact with structured data, such as databases and knowledge graphs. For tables, it supports basic operations like extracting column names and sub-tables. While using tools and focusing on QA tabular data, it only processes single tables and offers a limited set of functions, restricting its ability to perform complex data manipulations or analyses across multiple tables. TableLLM [32] mainly focuses on enabling LLMs to manipulate tabular data embedded in documents and spread- sheets. It extracts tables and executes operations based on user instructions, primarily handling tasks like data filtering and chart generation. ReAcTable [33] is built upon the ReAct model and gen- erates intermediate data representations to transform data into a more accessible format for answering questions. However, it relies on executing SQL and Python code, inheriting the disadvantages of both, including inefficiency with large datasets and potential security risks associated with code execution. None of these methods focus on large tables that are commonly used in scientific research. 3 METHDOLOGY In this section, we begin by defining the problem of transforming a user\u2019s natural language query into a sequence of operations over tabular data. Due to the NP-hardness of finding an optimal solution, we propose a solution to solving complex Table QA tasks through a combination of large language models (LLMs) and a tree-structured planning framework, where raw tables serve as leaf nodes, inter- mediate results form internal nodes, and the final result is the root. We further introduce a three-level vector index system to facilitate efficient retrieval of columns among large tables. 3.1 Problem Definition Table QA tasks often require operations such as projection, sorting, grouping, aggregation, and joining across multiple tables. Deter- mining the optimal sequence of operations to answer a user\u2019s query is computationally infeasible due to the NP-hardness of the prob- lem, as we prove later. To overcome the limitations of traditional Figure 1: The Example of Tree Structure Planning methods, we formulate the problem as finding the correct sequence of operations that, when applied to the datasets, yields the desired result according to the user\u2019s query. Definition 1 (Problem Definition). Given a set of tabular data D = {\ud835\udc511,\ud835\udc512, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5a}, a user query \ud835\udc5e, and a set of operators on D denoted by O = {\ud835\udc5c1,\ud835\udc5c2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b}, our objective is to generate a logical plan \ud835\udc5d\u2208\ud835\udc43with O\ud835\udc56\u2286O so that \ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc5e, D) yields a result that satisfies \ud835\udc5e. Assuming the true answer to \ud835\udc5eis \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5e, our objective is as below: min \ud835\udc5d\u2208\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc5e, D), \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5e)",
    "of operators on D denoted by O = {\ud835\udc5c1,\ud835\udc5c2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b}, our objective is to generate a logical plan \ud835\udc5d\u2208\ud835\udc43with O\ud835\udc56\u2286O so that \ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc5e, D) yields a result that satisfies \ud835\udc5e. Assuming the true answer to \ud835\udc5eis \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5e, our objective is as below: min \ud835\udc5d\u2208\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc5e, D), \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5e) (1) where each table contains columns \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56.\ud835\udc36, each \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56is a fundamen- tal operation (e.g., selection, projection, joining, aggregation, and advanced analytical functions); \ud835\udc43is all possible combinations of operators; A function \ud835\udc53(D,\ud835\udc5e, O) produces \ud835\udc5d; \ud835\udc46(D) denotes the application of the sequence \ud835\udc46to the datasets D, resulting in the pro- cessed data; \ud835\udc3fis a loss function that quantifies how well the result satisfies the user\u2019s query. For instance, it could be defined based on the logical correctness of \ud835\udc5dto answer \ud835\udc5eon D or the distance between the answer produced by \ud835\udc5dand the true answer. 3.2 Hardness of the Problem Theorem 1. Finding the optimal sequence of operations is an NP-hard problem. Determining the optimal sequence\ud835\udc5dthat minimize \ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc5e, D), \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5e) is computationally challenging. This problem is analogous to the classical planning problem in artificial intelligence, which is known to be NP-hard due to the combinatorial explosion of possible opera- tion sequences and dependencies between operations. The proof is shown in Appendix A.1. Therefore, it is impractical to exhaustively search for the optimal sequence in polynomial time. 3.3 Tree Structure Representation To effectively address the complexity of Table QA tasks, we propose a tree-structured plan that represents the sequence of operations as a computational graph. This structure allows us to decompose ContlID Country!ID CountryName Continent ID Maker FullName Country ContID CountryID CountryName Continent ID Maker FullName Country CONTINENTS Continent (name) COUNTRIES CAR_MAKERS Step 1.

More importantly, research [1, 20] has demonstrated that the tree-structured plan and the sequence of operations can be transformed into one another without loss of information or functionality. This bidirectional transformation is the foundation of our solution, as it ensures that a feasible tree- structured plan is the solution of our problem. Our tree-structured plan consists of the following components: \u2022 Leaves (Initial Tables): The independent tabular datasets \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\u2208 D are represented as the leaf nodes of the tree. Each leaf node corresponds to a raw dataset serving as input to the process. \u2022 Intermediate Nodes (intermediate results): Each intermedi- ate node represents an intermediate result, which executes an operation \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56\u2208O on one or more child nodes (initial tables or intermediate results) to produce a new parent node. \u2022 Root Node (Final Result): The root node represents the final an- swer to the user\u2019s query, obtained after performing all necessary operations on the data. Figure 1 illustrates how our system leverages tree-structure plan- ning to progressively generate the final result through a sequence of operations on tabular data. Both plans aim to answer the query: \"Which countries in Europe have at least 3 car manufacturers?\" This question is from the Spider Dataset [29], and the SQL is the ground truth of this query. This question involves three tables, CONTINENTS, COUNTRIES, and CAR_MAKERS, which are also the leaves in our Tree structure solution. The SQL-based plan begins by joining the COUNTRIES and CONTINENTS tables using the \u2018Continent\u2019 and \u2018ContId\u2019 fields to combine country and continent information. It then joins this result with the CAR_MAKERS table on the \u2018Country\u2019 field, adding car manufacturer details such as \u2018ID\u2019, \u2018Maker\u2019, and \u2018FullName\u2019. After filtering to include only countries in Europe, the data is grouped by \u2018CountryName\u2019, counting the number of car manufacturers per country. The system filters the groups to keep only those with at least 3 manufacturers and finally selects the \u2018CountryName\u2019 column to produce the list of countries in Europe with three or more car manufacturers. Our plan executs in a more efficient way by filtering countries by continent earlier in the execution. After joining the COUNTRIES and CONTINENTS",
    "only those with at least 3 manufacturers and finally selects the \u2018CountryName\u2019 column to produce the list of countries in Europe with three or more car manufacturers. Our plan executs in a more efficient way by filtering countries by continent earlier in the execution. After joining the COUNTRIES and CONTINENTS tables to create Inter Table 1 with combined country and continent data, we immediately filter this interme- diate table to retain only European countries (Continent = \u2019Eu- rope\u2019). This early filtering reduces the dataset before the join with CAR_MAKERS, resulting in a smaller Inter Table 3 that includes only relevant data for European countries. Following this join, the remaining steps in our plan are similar to those in the SQL execution plan: we group Inter Table 3 by CountryID, count the number of car manufacturers per country to get Inter Table 4. Finally, we filter to keep only those with at least three manufacturers, and extract CountryName into Final Table. This optimized approach minimizes intermediate data size and avoids unnecessary operations, making the execution more efficient. This process demonstrates the iterative nature of tree-structure planning, where operations are sequentially applied, and the LLM evaluates intermediate results to decide the next step, discarding Text queries ReAct Logical Planning Operators Query Plans (Next Action) Action Executor Table Description Generator Column embeddings Observation Action Tabular Data Column name clustering, cluster and table summaries Cluster embeddings Three-level vector retrieval Large Tables Table-Colum Retriever Figure 2: The Architecture of Tree-Driven Sequential Opera- tion QA System (TSO) irrelevant data when necessary to refine the path toward the final result. Overall, the tree-structured plan offers four advantages: Learning Relational Tasks. Constructing the tree involves discov- ering and applying appropriate relational operations that integrate various data sources to derive the final result. It effectively captures the relational reasoning required in complex Table QA tasks. Sequential Generation of the Computational Graph. The tree struc- ture can be linearized, generating the computational graph sequen- tially from the leaves to the root. This linearization enables us to process operations step by step, applying one operation at a time and progressively building towards the final result. Feasibility with Large Language Models. By linearizing the pro- cess, we make it manageable for LLMs to handle. The LLM can focus on selecting and applying one operation at a time rather than generating the entire operation sequence in one step, which would be impractical due to computational constraints. (might combine with the previous one) Ability to Backtrace. By maintaining all intermediate nodes (ta- bles), we enable the framework to backtrack to previous operations if the LLM realizes that a certain path does not lead towards the desired outcome. This enhances the robustness of the solution",

By maintaining all intermediate nodes (ta- bles), we enable the framework to backtrack to previous operations if the LLM realizes that a certain path does not lead towards the desired outcome. This enhances the robustness of the solution by allowing corrections and adjustments, as any node above the leaves represents the result of a sequence of operations applied thus far. 3.4 The Architecture Now, we are ready to introduce our solution, a Tree-Driven Sequential Operation QA System (TSO) that seamlessly combines observing the tree-structure state and reasoning the next operation. The ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) framework provides such an integration, allowing LLMs to not only interpret and reason user queries but also to execute actions through predefined tools. By adopting the ReAct framework, we can decompose complex queries into man- ageable tasks, execute them efficiently, and iteratively refine the results to satisfy the user\u2019s query. Figure 2 shows the overall system structure. At the center of our system is a supervisor agent, an LLM responsible for interpreting user queries and orchestrating the execution of tasks using available tools. The supervisor agent operates through an iterative loop comprising the following steps: Text to Query Plans for Question Answering on Large Tables Conference acronym \u2019XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY (1) Thought: The supervisor agent assesses the current state of the tree, including all existing intermediate nodes and their results. Using the tree structure, the agent determines which relational operations are required next to move closer to the final result. It identifies dependencies and potential operations based on the current intermediate results. (2) Action: The agent chooses the most appropriate operation \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56\u2208O to apply to one or more child nodes. When the agent applies an operation, it adds a new intermediate node to the tree. This operation combines data from the relevant child nodes (which could be initial tables or previous intermediate results) to create a new parent node. (3) Observation: After performing the operation, the agent examines the result, which is the new intermediate node, and evaluates whether it helps answer the user\u2019s query. The LLM observes the current state by reviewing all tables and their descriptions generated by the table description generator. (4) Backtracking: If the observation indicates that the current path is not leading towards the desired outcome, the agent can backtrack by revisiting previous nodes and reconsidering alternative operations. The ability to backtrace leverages the tree\u2019s hierarchical structure, allowing the agent to navigate to different branches and explore alternative sequences of operations. This step is optional and is integrated with the Action step. As the iterative loop progresses, each operation adds a new node to the",

This step is optional and is integrated with the Action step. As the iterative loop progresses, each operation adds a new node to the tree, building the computational graph step-by-step from the leaves to the root. Toolset Description. We have developed a comprehensive set of tools within the ReAct framework to perform various data manipu- lation and analysis tasks. These tools are designed to handle large datasets and can be easily extended to include new functionalities. The key tools in our system include: \u2022 Data Loading Tool: Reads tabular files (e.g., CSV, Excel) into a DataFrame for processing. \u2022 Data Sampling Tool: Retrieves sample rows from a DataFrame to provide an overview of the data. \u2022 Aggregation Tool: Performs aggregation operations such as sum, mean, count, and max on selected columns. \u2022 Grouping Tool: Groups data by specified columns and optionally orders the results based on other columns. \u2022 Dataframe Introduction Tool: Generates summaries of DataFrames, including column indices and descriptions. \u2022 Join Tool: Merges two DataFrames based on specified join types and columns. \u2022 Sorting Tool: Sorts data within a DataFrame according to specified columns and order. \u2022 Selection and Filtering Tool: Selects specific columns and filters rows based on given conditions. \u2022 Set Operations Tool: Executes set operations (e.g., union, intersec- tion) between two DataFrames. \u2022 Advanced Analysis Tools: Performs complex analyses such as Prin- cipal Component Analysis (PCA), anomaly detection, PythonRE- PLTool, and value prediction.

This massive scale creates significant challenges when the ReAct model is trying to understand all tables. Feeding the entire dataset or schema is impractical due to token limits.

    "spread across multiple tables. This massive scale creates significant challenges when the ReAct model is trying to understand all tables. Feeding the entire dataset or schema is impractical due to token limits. To handle this, we create multi-level vector indexes for columns, clusters, and tables. By converting descriptions of these elements into vector formats (Algorithm 1), we can quickly compare the user\u2019s query with the data components (Algorithm 2). This helps us find and provide only the necessary columns to the LLM, bypassing the context length issue while ensuring the system remains scalable and efficient. Algorithm 1 constructs the vector stores necessary for efficient query processing by embedding the semantic descriptions of columns, clusters, and tables in a hierarchical structure. The algorithm begins by iterating through each table \ud835\udc51in the database D. For each table, it processes its columns by iterating over each column \ud835\udc50(Lines 3\u20134). A human-readable description of each column is generated using an LLM, which captures the semantic meaning of the column data. The column description is then embedded into a vector l\ud835\udc50 (Line 5), enabling numerical similarity computations. The column embeddings and descriptions are stored in the vector store l\ud835\udc36using column IDs as keys (Line 6). Once the columns have been processed, the algorithm clusters the columns based on their embeddings (Line 7). For each resulting cluster \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc57, the LLM summarizes the descriptions of the columns within the cluster to generate a cluster description (Lines 8\u20139). This cluster description is then embedded into a vector l\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc57(Line 10), and both the cluster embeddings and descriptions are stored in the vector store l\ud835\udc3ausing cluster IDs as keys (Line 11). After processing the clusters, the algorithm generates a descrip- tion for the entire table by summarizing the descriptions of the clusters within it (Lines 12\u201313). This table description is embedded into a vector l\ud835\udc51, and the table embeddings and descriptions are stored in the vector store lD using table IDs as keys (Line 14).

This hierarchical embedding structure allows for efficient query processing by enabling similarity searches at multiple levels (columns, clusters, and tables), ensuring scalability when dealing with large datasets. Algorithm 2 retrieves the columns relevant to a user\u2019s ques- tion by leveraging the vector embeddings of tables, clusters, and columns, stored in hierarchical vector stores. The algorithm begins by embedding the user\u2019s natural language query \ud835\udc5einto a vector q using the embedding function (Line 2). The query embedding is then compared with the vector embeddings of all tables l\ud835\udc51in the database to compute similarity scores \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc51(Lines 3\u20134). Tables with similarity scores above a threshold \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc61are selected as candidate tables (Line 5). These tables are stored in T for further evaluation. For each candidate table \ud835\udc51in T, the algorithm first validates whether the table is relevant to the user\u2019s question by checking the semantic description generated by the LLM (Line 7). If the table is relevant, the algorithm proceeds by calculating similarity scores between the query embedding and the cluster embeddings l\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc57 within the table. Clusters with similarity scores above a threshold \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc50are selected and stored in C (Lines 8-10). From Lines 12-15, the algorithm validates each selected cluster to determine if its semantic description aligns with the user\u2019s question. If the entire cluster is relevant, the algorithm includes all columns from the cluster in the set of relevant columns \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59, otherwise, the algorithm evaluates the relevance of individual columns within the cluster by computing similarity scores between the query em- bedding and column embeddings l\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58(Lines 16\u201318). Columns with similarity scores above a threshold \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc59are considered as candidates and validated using their semantic descriptions (Lines 19\u201322). If validated, these columns are added to \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59. After processing all relevant clusters in all relevant tables, the algorithm returns the set of relevant columns \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59(Line 23). This hierarchical process ensures that the most relevant columns are selected based on their similarity to the user\u2019s query and their alignment with the query\u2019s semantic intent. 4 EXPERIMENT In this section, we provide experimental results on two practical datasets, the Spider dataset [29] and the agronomic dataset [21].

The experiments on the Spider dataset demonstrate that our solution performs well on traditional tabular data in Table QA tasks, even without utilizing any training data from the dataset. Moreover, we will discuss the deficiency of the Spider Data. The experiments on the agronomic dataset show that our solution is capable of handling super large tabular data under complex Table QA tasks. 4.1 Dataset Spider [29] is a widely recognized benchmark dataset for Text- to-SQL tasks. It contains 8,659 instances in the training split and 1,034 instances in the development split across 200 databases. Each instance consists of a natural language question about a specific database and its corresponding SQL query. In this paper, we use the development split (Spider-dev) only for evaluation purposes, as we do not utilize the training data for model training. This approach allows us to assess the generalization ability of our solution without any fine-tuning of the training data. The agronomic dataset [21] is a comprehensive dataset that con- tains results of the crop yield experiments from Australia. The dataset serves for a purpose of understanding crop growth and development under varying environmental and meteorological con- ditions. The dataset collects trial results from 2008 to 2018. The dataset is structured around various data domains (DOMs), each providing unique insights into different aspects of crop trials. The dataset captures time-series data, with many features recorded at multiple time intervals relative to the planting date. In total, the agronomic dataset comprises 266,033 records and 8,058 features, making it a substantial resource for evaluating the scalability and effectiveness of our solution on large-scale, complex datasets. The dataset represents a typical trend of tabular data organisation in the \u201cbig data\u201d era in scientific domains. For more details, please see Appendix A.2 4.2 Experiment Setting Metric. For the Spider dataset, since our solution outputs DataFrames instead of SQL queries, we execute the ground truth SQL queries and compare their results with our DataFrames. We use the Exact Match (EM) accuracy metric, which measures the proportion of queries where our result exactly matches the ground truth. This metric directly assesses the correctness of the data retrieved, re- gardless of how the query is written. We report EM accuracy across different query hardness levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Extra Hard) as defined in the Spider dataset. For the agronomic dataset, because it doesn\u2019t have predefined questions, we designed 20 queries: 10 easy, 5 medium, and 5 hard. The easy queries involve straightforward operations like selection Text to Query Plans for Question Answering on",

For the agronomic dataset, because it doesn\u2019t have predefined questions, we designed 20 queries: 10 easy, 5 medium, and 5 hard. The easy queries involve straightforward operations like selection Text to Query Plans for Question Answering on Large Tables Conference acronym \u2019XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY and ordering; medium queries require multi-step operations involv- ing multiple columns; hard queries involve complex operations like principal component analysis (PCA) or anomaly detection. We manually obtained the ground truth answers using standard data processing tools and compared them with our solution\u2019s outputs. We report EM accuracy for each difficulty level to assess our solu- tion\u2019s performance across varying query complexities. Baselines. For the Spider dataset, we compare our method TSOwith DIN-SQL [22], as only this work provides the per-hardness EM accuracy metrics, and it ranks third on the Spider Execution with Values leaderboard, only 1.501% behind the top method. DIN-SQL provides per-hardness EM accuracy metrics, making it a strong benchmark for our evaluation. For the agronomic dataset, since there are no existing baselines for our specific task, we focus on evaluating our solution\u2019s performance on the designed queries and discuss its effectiveness in handling complex, real-world data. 4.3 Scientific Tabular Data We conducted experiments on the agronomic dataset using 20 care- fully designed questions of varying difficulty levels\u201410 easy, 5 medium, and 5 hard\u2014to evaluate the effectiveness of our solution. For the prediction task, we consider a prediction \"correct\" if its percentage error is within 10%. The percentage error is calculated as 1 \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5e|\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc5e, D) \u2212\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5e| \u2217100%. Our method correctly answers 16 out of 20 queries. Due to space limitations, we only show four of the questions where our solution did not provide the correct answer to show the limitations of our approach. Noting that, the column size exceeds many existing work\u2019s processing capability. For the full list, please refer to Appendix A.3 and Table 2. Question 7: List the different crop rotations recorded one year before planting. This question is to retrieve the column METADom_Crop_rotation_minus_1_sub_cropWheat, which indi- cates the presence of wheat in the crop rotation one year before planting. However, the generated description for this column was misleading to the Table-Column Retriever. The description stated: \"This column indicates the presence of wheat within the crop rota- tion system one day before planting (day -1).\" The misinterpretation is because the description suggested a time frame of one day be- fore planting, whereas the column represents one year prior. This discrepancy led the Table-Column Retriever to incorrectly assess the relevance of the column to the user\u2019s query, resulting in an incorrect answer. Question 15: How does cumulative evapotranspiration over",
    "because the description suggested a time frame of one day be- fore planting, whereas the column represents one year prior. This discrepancy led the Table-Column Retriever to incorrectly assess the relevance of the column to the user\u2019s query, resulting in an incorrect answer. Question 15: How does cumulative evapotranspiration over the first 80 days after planting relate to grain yield? This ques- tion is to relative to column PHENDom_X1000.grain.weight_2, 3, and 6. However, the question was ambiguous, leading the language model to return only the first relevant column, PHENDom_X1000.grain.weight_2, instead of all three. This indicates a limitation in handling ambigu- ous queries and suggests that providing more explicit instructions or incorporating clarification steps could improve the results. Questions 19: For trials with high waterlogging, assess whether soil properties contribute to the condition; Question 20: Use machine learning to predict the breeder based on phenotypic and environmental data. The two questions are complex analyti- cal tasks that likely involve advanced computations or multi-step Table 1: Experimental Results on the Spider Dataset.

During the search for the answers, the supervi- sor agent decided to utilize the PythonREPLTool to execute Python code to solve the problems. However, the agent became trapped in debugging code errors and was unable to find a solution within the maximum iteration limit. Despite these challenges, the overall performance indicates that, with the proper tools, our solution effectively interprets and pro- cesses user queries over large tabular datasets. Future work may focus on improving ambiguity resolution, enhancing description accuracy, and developing more robust code generation techniques to further increase the system\u2019s capabilities. 4.4 Spider Dataset We evaluated our solution on the Spider dataset to assess its per- formance in interpreting natural language queries over complex databases. The results are shown in Table 1. Our solution has two versions: TSO and TSO\u2212. The difference is that TSO has access to the database schema, while TSO\u2212does not. We have the following observations: Our solution TSO achieved the second-best overall score, per- forming well across all difficulty levels. Notably, TSO got the best results in the Easy and Extra Hard categories, showing its effec- tiveness in handling both simple and complex queries. In contrast, TSO\u2212performed worse than TSO. This shows the importance of providing",
    "solution TSO achieved the second-best overall score, per- forming well across all difficulty levels. Notably, TSO got the best results in the Easy and Extra Hard categories, showing its effec- tiveness in handling both simple and complex queries. In contrast, TSO\u2212performed worse than TSO. This shows the importance of providing the schema to the solution. Knowing the schema helps the system accurately map user queries to the relevant tables and columns, especially in complex databases with many tables. The result shows that GPT models perform better in handling complex Table QA tasks. This trend matches the Spider leaderboard, where GPT-4-based solutions are among the top performers. The advanced reasoning and language understanding of GPT models help our solution perform well across various query difficulties. Discussion on Spider Dataset. We found that some discrepancies were not due to errors in our solution but were caused by issues within the ground truth itself. From the six distinct types of errors including inconsistencies in query formulation, improper handling of NULL values, unjustified semantic inferences, misinterpretations of domain-specific terminology, data type mismatches, and ambi- guities in query interpretation, we illustrate how these issues can significantly impact the accuracy and reliability of QA systems. These errors not only affected the evaluation of our solution\u2019s per- formance but also underscored how such issues can substantially influence the outcomes of QA models. Conference acronym \u2019XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY Yipeng Zhang, Chen Wang, Yuzhe Zhang, and Jacky Jiang 1. Inconsistent Use of the DISTINCT Clause. Question 1: \"Find the first name and age of students who have a pet.\" SELECT DISTINCT T1 . fname , T1 . age FROM student AS T1 JOIN has_pet AS T2 ON T1 . s t u i d = T2 . s t u i d ; Question 2: \"List all singer names in concerts in year 2014.\" SELECT T2 . name FROM s i n g e r _ i n _ c o n c e r t AS T1 JOIN s i n g e r AS T2 ON T1 . s i n g e r _ i d = T2 . s i n g e r _ i d JOIN concert AS T3 ON T1 . c o n c e r t _ i d = T3 . c o n c e r t _ i d WHERE T3 . year = 2 0 1 4; Discussion. The ground truth SQL queries display an inconsis- tency in handling duplicate results due to the selective use of the DISTINCT clause.

    "2 0 1 4; Discussion. The ground truth SQL queries display an inconsis- tency in handling duplicate results due to the selective use of the DISTINCT clause. While the first query removes duplicates to present unique combinations of student names and ages, the second query does not eliminate duplicates of singer names. This inconsistency can lead to unreliable evaluations of QA models, as the presence or absence of duplicates affects the correctness of the output. For consistent and accurate results, similar queries should uniformly apply the DISTINCT clause when duplicates are possible. 2. Improper Treatment of NULL Values in Calculations. Question: \"For each zip code, what is the average mean temperature for all dates that start with \u20198\u2019?\" SELECT zip_code , avg ( mean_temperature_f ) FROM weather WHERE date LIKE \" 8/ %\" GROUP BY zip_code Discussion. The ground truth SQL may incorrectly compute the average temperature by misinterpreting NULL values as zeros. In data science and SQL standards, NULL values should be excluded from aggregate functions like AVG(). Treating NULL as zero intro- duces bias and leads to inaccurate results. The error highlights the need for careful handling of missing data to ensure the validity of statistical computations in SQL queries. 3. Assumptive Semantic Substitution. Question: \"Show the medicine names and trade names that cannot interact with the enzyme with product \u2019Heme\u2019.\" SELECT name , trade_name FROM medicine EXCEPT SELECT T1 . name , T1 . trade_name FROM medicine AS T1 JOIN m e d i c i n e _ i n t e r a c t i o n AS T2 ON T2 . medicine_id = T1 . id JOIN enzyme AS T3 ON T3 . id = T2 . enzyme_id WHERE T3 . product = ' Protoporphyrinogen IX ' ; Discussion. The ground truth query makes an unwarranted infer- ence by replacing the user-provided term \u2019Heme\u2019 with \u2019Protopor- phyrinogen IX\u2019. This substitution is not justified within the given context and disregards the user\u2019s explicit input. Such semantic assumptions can lead to incorrect query results and misinterpreta- tion of the user\u2019s intent. Accurate SQL generation should adhere strictly to the user\u2019s specified terms unless additional context or clarification is provided. 4. Terminology Misalignment in Domain Concepts. Question: \"Find the model of the car whose weight is below the average weight.\" SELECT T1 . model FROM CAR_NAMES AS T1 JOIN CARS_DATA AS T2 ON T1 . MakeId = T2 . Id WHERE T2 . Weight < ( SELECT AVG( Weight ) FROM CARS_DATA) ; Ground-Truth: Model toyota plymouth . . . Discussion. The ground truth SQL misinterprets the term \"model\" by returning car makes instead of models. In the automotive do- main, the make is the manufacturer",
    "= T2 . Id WHERE T2 . Weight < ( SELECT AVG( Weight ) FROM CARS_DATA) ; Ground-Truth: Model toyota plymouth . . . Discussion. The ground truth SQL misinterprets the term \"model\" by returning car makes instead of models. In the automotive do- main, the make is the manufacturer (e.g., Toyota), and the model is the specific vehicle line (e.g., Camry). This misalignment leads to incorrect results that do not satisfy the user\u2019s query. Precise under- standing of domain-specific terminology is crucial for generating accurate SQL queries that reflect the user\u2019s intent. 5. Incorrect Data Type Handling in Numeric Comparisons. Ques- tion: \"What is the number of the cars with horsepower more than 150?\" SELECT COUNT ( \u2217) FROM CARS_DATA WHERE horsepower > 1 5 0 ; Discussion. The ground truth SQL fails to account for the data type of the horsepower column, which is stored as a string. Performing numerical comparisons on string data can yield erroneous results due to lexicographical ordering (e.g., \u2019200\u2019 is considered less than \u201980\u2019 because \u20192\u2019 comes before \u20198\u2019). To ensure accurate comparisons, the query should cast the horsepower column to a numeric data type before applying the comparison operator. This oversight highlights the importance of data type considerations in SQL queries involving numerical operations. 6. Ambiguous Reference to Entity Identifiers. Question: \"What are all the makers and models?\" SELECT Maker , Model FROM MODEL_LIST ; Ground-Truth: Maker Model 1 amc 2 audi 3 bmw . . . . . . Our Result: Maker Model amc amc volkswagen audi volkswagen volkswagen . . . . . . Discussion. The ground truth SQL returns maker IDs instead of maker names, which may not align with the user\u2019s expectation of obtaining human-readable information. In cases where identifiers can represent multiple entities (e.g., IDs vs. names), it\u2019s important to clarify the user\u2019s intent or default to the more informative option. This ambiguity can lead to outputs that are technically correct but practically unhelpful, affecting the user\u2019s ability to interpret the results. 7. Insufficient Handling of Tied Results in Aggregations. Question: \"Which year has the most number of concerts?\" SELECT YEAR FROM concert GROUP BY YEAR ORDER BY COUNT ( \u2217) DESC LIMIT 1 ; Ground-Truth: Year 2015 Our Result: Year count ( \u2217) 2014 3 2015 3 Discussion. The ground truth SQL does not account for the pos- sibility of ties when determining the year with the most concerts. By applying LIMIT 1, it arbitrarily selects one of the years with the highest count, potentially omitting other equally valid results. Properly handling ties in aggregate functions is essential to provide a complete and accurate answer to the user\u2019s query. Adjusting the Text to Query Plans for",
    "the most concerts. By applying LIMIT 1, it arbitrarily selects one of the years with the highest count, potentially omitting other equally valid results. Properly handling ties in aggregate functions is essential to provide a complete and accurate answer to the user\u2019s query. Adjusting the Text to Query Plans for Question Answering on Large Tables Conference acronym \u2019XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY query to include all years with the maximum number of concerts ensures that the output fully addresses the user\u2019s question. 5 CONCLUSION We proposed the Tree-Driven Sequential Operation QA System (TSO), which transforms natural language queries into logical query plans on structured data without relying on SQL generation. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) to iteratively construct sequences of operations, TSO effectively handles queries of varying complexity. Our experiments on the Spider dataset and a large agro- nomic dataset with over 8,000 columns demonstrate TSO\u2019s ability to process extensive real-world tabular data that many existing QA systems cannot handle. Particularly, TSO successfully manages scientific data with thousands of columns, showcasing its scalability and flexibility. Our work offers a flexible and scalable solution for natural language querying and analysis of large real-world tabular datasets. REFERENCES [1] Alfred V. Aho, Ravi Sethi, and Jeffrey D.

Text to Query Plans for Question Answering on Large Tables Conference acronym \u2019XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY A APPENDIX A.1 The NP Hardness or Our Problem We can reduce the classical planning problem to our problem by mapping: Proof. We prove that our problem is NP-hard by reducing the Classical Planning Problem to our problem. In the Classical Plan- ning Problem, given an initial state \ud835\udc600, a set of actions A, and a goal state \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc54, the question is whether there exists a sequence of actions \ud835\udf0b= \u27e8\ud835\udc4e1,\ud835\udc4e2, . . . ,\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc58\u27e9, where \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56\u2208A, such that applying \ud835\udf0bto \ud835\udc600 results in \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc54. We construct an instance of our problem as follows. The dataset D represents the initial state \ud835\udc600. Each action \ud835\udc4e\u2208A cor- responds to an operation \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc4e\u2208O that transforms the dataset. The user query \ud835\udc5especifies the goal state \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc54. If we can find a sequence of operations \ud835\udc5d= \u27e8\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc4e1,\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc4e2, . . . ,\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc58\u27e9that, when applied to D, results in a dataset corresponding to \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc54, then this sequence corresponds to a solution to the Classical Planning Problem. Therefore, solving our problem would solve the Classical Planning Problem. Since the Classical Planning Problem is NP-complete, and we can reduce any instance of it to our problem in polynomial time, the decision problem of our problem is NP-complete. Hence, the optimization version of our problem is NP-hard. \u25a1 A.2 The Agronomic Dataset The agronomic dataset [21] is a comprehensive resource de- signed to monitor and analyze crop growth and development across a range of environmental and meteorological conditions. The dataset is structured around various data domains (DOMs), each offering unique insights into different aspects of the crop trials. These in- clude meteorological data from the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM), satellite-based spectral data, metadata on trials and field manage- ment, phenological observations, and environmental variables. Each domain contains columns with structured names that provide a hierarchical description of the variables. The dataset captures time- series data, where many features are recorded at multiple time intervals relative to the planting date. In total, the dataset contains 266033 records and 8058 features. Domains Overview: MANDom (Metadata Domain): The MAN- Dom domain provides metadata related to the crop trials, including information about the trial series, operators, farm machinery, and breeders. Trial Series: Columns like MANDom_Series_name followed by the series identifier (e.g., Durum, Early.Conventional, ITAdv- MainLEP) document the trial series names and types. Breeder In- formation: Columns such as MANDom_Breeder followed by the breeder\u2019s name (e.g., Advanta.Seeds, Bayer.CropScience) track the entities responsible for breeding the varieties tested in the trials. Orientation: Columns like MANDom_Orientation_sub_cropNorth, MANDom_Orientation_sub_cropWest indicate the crop orientation for each trial, providing",

Breeder In- formation: Columns such as MANDom_Breeder followed by the breeder\u2019s name (e.g., Advanta.Seeds, Bayer.CropScience) track the entities responsible for breeding the varieties tested in the trials. Orientation: Columns like MANDom_Orientation_sub_cropNorth, MANDom_Orientation_sub_cropWest indicate the crop orientation for each trial, providing insight into field setup. PHENDom (Phe- nological Domain): The PHENDom domain captures phenotypic observations during crop growth. These include measurements of plant development stages, yield, and other crop characteristics. Yield Measurements: Columns like PHENDom_yield_pct_ of_average, PHENDom_yield_t_hatrack the crop yield either as a percentage of the average or in tons per hectare. Develop- ment Stages: The PHENDom_Zadoks_score columns (e.g., PHEN- Dom_Zadoks_score_obs_1, PHENDom_Zadoks_score_obs_2) record the Zadoks score at various observations, representing the pheno- logical stages of plant growth. Grain Quality: Columns like PHEN- Dom_X1000.grain.weight_2, PHENDom_X1000.grain.weight_6 track important parameters such as grain weight across different mea- surements. Disease and Stress Resistance: Columns like PHENDo m_Yellow_Leaf_Spot, PHENDom_Waterlogging, andPHENDom _Weed_score indicate the plant\u2019s resilience against environmen- tal stressors and disease. METADom (Metadata Domain for Field and Chemical Management): The METADom domain provides in- formation on crop and chemical rotations, soil tests, and fertilizer applications. Crop Rotations: Columns like METADom_Crop_rotation_minu s_5_sub_cropWheat and METADom_Crop_rotation_minus_4_su b_cropField. Pea records the sequence of crops grown in previous years, offering insight into crop management practices. Soil Tests: Columns such as METADom_Soil_test_class_10cm_Colwell,M ETADom_Soil_test_class_60cm_Bray report the results of soil tests, providing data on soil properties at different depths. Previous Crop: Fields like METADom_previous_crop_same_sub_cropTRUE indicate whether the same crop was planted in consecutive years, potentially influencing soil health and yield outcomes. ENVDom (Environmental Domain): The ENVDom domain contains environ- mental variables that could impact crop yield, such as damage from pests, animals, or herbicides. Damage Assessment: Fields like ENVDom_Damage provide in- sight into environmental damage affecting crops during the grow- ing season. BOMDom (Bureau of Meteorology Domain): The BOM- Dom domain captures key meteorological data such as temperature and rainfall, tracked over time for each trial. Temperature: Columns like BOMDom_max_temperature_m ean_.80throughBOMDom_max_temperature_mean_250 and BOMDom_min_temperature_mean_0 through BOMDom_min_t emperature_mean_250 provide time-series data of maximum and minimum temperatures for specific days relative to planting (e.g., -80 days before planting to 250 days after). Rainfall: Similar to tem- perature, columns like BOMDom_rainfall_mean_0 through BOM- Dom_rainfall_mean_250 track daily rainfall data. Other Meteorolog- ical Variables: Columns such as BOMDom_solar_exposure_mean provide information on sunlight exposure during the crop\u2019s growing season. SatDom (Satellite Domain): The SatDom domain includes remote sensing data obtained from satellite observations, capturing a variety of spectral bands and other atmospheric and vegetative properties. Spectral Data: Columns like SatDom_blue_band_mean_80, SatDom_NIR_mean_70, SatDom_MIR_mean_60 represent re- flectance data in different spectral bands (e.g., blue, NIR, MIR), which are important for analyzing vegetation health. Vegetation Indices: Columns such as SatDom_NDVI_mean_80, SatDom_EVI_mean_60, SatDom_FPAR_mean_70 provide indices",

    "condition. S 20. Use machine learning to predict the breeder based on phe- notypic and environmental data. S Each of the aforementioned domains follows a consistent column- naming convention, which includes a prefix that identifies the data source or domain (e.g., MANDom, PHENDom, METADom, BOM- Dom, SatDom), followed by a descriptor that provides information on the specific variable being measured, and ending with a time point suffix (for time-series data) that indicates the day relative to planting. This time suffix allows users to track how each vari- able changes over the crop\u2019s growing period. Additionally, certain domains (such as MANDom and METADom) contain metadata that does not vary over time but provides contextual information essential for interpreting the results of the trials. This dataset is designed to facilitate the analysis of complex en- vironmental and phenotypic factors affecting crop development and can be used to model relationships between environmental conditions and crop performance over time. The combination of meteorological, satellite, and phenotypic data makes the agronomic dataset a rich resource for agricultural researchers aiming to un- derstand and optimize crop yield under varying environmental conditions. A.3 The Full Questions for Agronomic Dataset Table 2 summarizes these questions along with their correspond- ing difficulty levels and results. The outcomes are labelled as T for correct answers, F for incorrect answers, and S for scenarios where the solution could not find an answer within the maximum iteration limit. A.4 LLM Models and Parameters. We utilize several large language models (LLMs) in our experiments to evaluate the performance of our solution: Llama 3.1: We use the Llama 3.1 model with 70 billion param- eters, denoted as Llama3.1:70-ins-q4. This model is known for its strong performance on various language understanding tasks and provides a solid baseline for comparison. GPT-4o-mini: This is a smaller version of the GPT-4o model, named gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18. It offers a balance between com- putational efficiency and performance, making it suitable for testing the scalability of our solution. GPT-4o: We employ the full GPT-4o model, version gpt-4o-2024 -05-13, which is a state-of-the-art language model with advanced reasoning capabilities. Its superior performance on complex tasks allows us to assess the upper bounds of our solution\u2019s effectiveness. In our Table-Column Retriever, we set the thresholds \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc61= 0.75, \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc50= 0.75, and \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc59= 0.75, which are used to filter relevant tables, clusters, and columns based on similarity scores between the query embedding and the data embeddings. We use the embedding model thenlper/gte-large to generate vector embeddings for text descriptions. This model facilitates the retrieval of relevant data elements in our three-level vector index by capturing the semantic meaning of the text.",

    "Chronological Passage Assembling in RAG framework for Temporal Question Answering Byeongjeong Kim, Jeonghyun Park, Joonho Yang, Hwanhee Lee* Department of Artificial Intelligence, Chung-Ang University {michael97k, tom0365, plm3332, hwanheelee}@cau.ac.kr Abstract Long-context question answering over narra- tive tasks is challenging because correct an- swers often hinge on reconstructing a coherent timeline of events while preserving contextual flow in a limited context window. Retrieval- augmented generation (RAG) indexing meth- ods aim to address this challenge by selectively retrieving only necessary document segments. However, narrative texts possess unique char- acteristics that limit the effectiveness of these existing approaches. Specifically, understand- ing narrative texts requires more than isolated segments, as the broader context and sequen- tial relationships between segments are crucial for comprehension. To address these limita- tions, we propose ChronoRAG, a novel RAG framework specialized for narrative texts. This approach focuses on two essential aspects: re- fining dispersed document information into co- herent and structured passages, and preserving narrative flow by explicitly capturing and main- taining the temporal order among retrieved pas- sages. We empirically demonstrate the effec- tiveness of ChronoRAG through experiments on the NarrativeQA dataset, showing substan- tial improvements in tasks requiring both fac- tual identification and comprehension of com- plex sequential relationships, underscoring that reasoning over temporal order is crucial in re- solving narrative QA. 1 Introduction Long-context question answering tasks, which re- quire the ability to utilize one or more long doc- uments (Pang et al., 2022), present a significant challenge in natural language processing. While modern transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown a remarkable ability to han- dle long contexts (Liu et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2024), they face fundamental limitations when con- fronted with extremely long-form text.

(a) Fine-grained indexing returns six standalone sentences, leaving key clues detached. (b) Our chronological as- sembling retrieves passages that include their immedi- ate chronological context, preserving the narrative flow. Boxes indicate the directly retrieved sentences. extensive documents for every query leads to ma- jor computational inefficiency, and as the context grows longer, the models\u2019 ability to accurately iden- tify and prioritize relevant information decreases, impacting the reliability of their outputs. To address these challenges, Retrieval- Augmented Generation (RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020) has become a standard approach, focusing on efficiently retrieving only relevant segments from large documents to integrate into the model\u2019s context window. This selective retrieval method helps models leverage vast knowledge bases far beyond their built-in context limits. However, a fundamental methodological gap ex- ists in most RAG frameworks (Lewis et al., 2020; Sarthi et al., 2024): they primarily treat documents as a collection of short, independently-retrieved snippets of information. This methodology fun- damentally conflicts with the sequential nature of long-form narratives, such as those found in history, literature, and film. Narrative texts are uniquely defined by their structure; they can be extremely arXiv:2508.18748v1 [cs.CL] 26 Aug 2025 long, their individual passages often fail to convey the full story unless read in order, and grasping the chronological and relational connections be- tween passages is essential for comprehension. Treating passages as isolated facts severs these crit- ical links, fragmenting the narrative timeline. Figure 1 illustrates the mismatch between con- ventional retrieval strategies and the characteristics of narrative data. A common approach, as shown in (a) of Figure 1, is to retrieve as many sentences as possible that are likely to match the query, often based on textual similarity. To do so, documents are typically stored as isolated sentences. While such methods may successfully retrieve a sentence containing the correct answer, they often fail to pro- vide sufficient contextual cues. For instance, this can create ambiguity, making it unclear whether \"London\" or \"Paris\" is the location relevant to the question, even if both are mentioned in the retrieved results. To address this issue, we introduce ChronoRAG, a novel RAG-based approach that embodies an al- ternative strategy grounded in the principle that solving narrative-based problems fundamentally requires recognizing the chronological order of events.

To address this issue, we introduce ChronoRAG, a novel RAG-based approach that embodies an al- ternative strategy grounded in the principle that solving narrative-based problems fundamentally requires recognizing the chronological order of events. Instead of maximizing the number of re- trieved sentences, our framework, as shown in (b) of Figure 1, retrieves fewer distinct informational units but includes their surrounding context to disambiguate meaning. This approach provides the crucial contextual clues\u2014indicating that \"London\" is associated with a reunion while \"Paris\" pertains to a farewell\u2014that are essential for accurate ques- tion answering. ChronoRAG achieves this by clar- ifying dispersed narrative content into structured passages and explicitly capturing the temporal rela- tionships between them, enabling the retrieval of a coherent narrative flow rather than a collection of isolated facts. We empirically validate our proposed approach on the NarrativeQA (Ko\u02c7cisk`y et al., 2018) dataset. To rigorously test temporal reasoning, we isolate a subset of \"Time Questions\" that require understand- ing event sequences. Our experiments show that our method achieves significant improvements in both the complete dataset and the specialized Time Question set. Notably, these results are achieved using lighter graph construction and retrieval mech- anisms than those found in existing summary and graph-based methods, demonstrating enhanced per- formance in identifying individual facts and com- prehending complex relational structures. \u2022 We find that resolving narrative QA requires leveraging event chronology and preserving con- textual flow, which guides our method in distill- ing dispersed story elements into coherent, tem- porally aware passages. \u2022 We introduce a novel RAG framework, ChronoRAG, which refines raw text into struc- tured passages, explicitly maintains temporal links between events, and incorporates adjacent context. \u2022 Experiments on the NarrativeQA dataset demon- strate the effectiveness of our framework, and emphasizing event-to-event relations drives per- formance gains for both factual and temporal queries, highlighting the critical role of relational understanding over entity extraction. 2 Related Work Passage Granularity. Document indexing ap- proaches have been explored with varying pas- sage granularity to improve retrieval precision. DenseXRetrieval (Chen et al., 2024) advocates finer granularities to enhance information precision. Conversely, MolecularFacts (Gunjal and Durrett, 2024) demonstrates that overly granular decompo- sitions such as atomic facts or propositions often lose critical contextual cues, advocating instead for concise yet contextually coherent units. Our method employs atomic facts as keys for retrieval while preserving broader narrative flows as the re- trieved values. Summary-Based Document Augmentation. Summary-based indexing methods, including RAPTOR (Sarthi et al., 2024), MemWalker (Chen et al., 2023), and ReadAgent (Lee et al., 2024) leverage iterative summarization to build hierar- chical structures that improve retrieval accuracy and contextual coherence. However, such methods often suffer from high",

Summary-based indexing methods, including RAPTOR (Sarthi et al., 2024), MemWalker (Chen et al., 2023), and ReadAgent (Lee et al., 2024) leverage iterative summarization to build hierar- chical structures that improve retrieval accuracy and contextual coherence. However, such methods often suffer from high computational costs due to deep hierarchical structures and redundant overlapping information. Our approach simplifies the hierarchical concept by adopting a single-layer summary, significantly reducing computation and overlap issues while maintaining contextual effectiveness. Knowledge Graph-Based Document Augmenta- tion. Graph-based augmentation methods, such as GraphRAG (Edge et al., 2024) and LightRAG (Guo et al., 2024), typically construct knowledge graphs by extracting entities and relationships from docu- ments. These methods are good at capturing entity- centric information but struggle to represent re- lationships between entities explicitly, a crucial element in narratives. Our proposed framework explicitly incorporates sequential relations among narrative elements, addressing this critical limita- tion of traditional knowledge graphs. 3 ChronoRAG We present ChronoRAG, a novel Retrieval- Augmented Generation (RAG) framework special- ized for narrative texts where chronological context is crucial. As described in Figure 2, our frame- work is composed of two primary stages: an offline Graph Construction phase where the original doc- uments are processed into a hierarchical, linked structure, and an online Passage Retrieval and Answer Generation phase where the constructed graph is used to answer queries. 3.1 Graph Construction The goal of this offline phase is to transform a raw document into a structured, two-layer graph that captures both factual information and narrative chronology. This process involves the following steps: Document Chunking. Due to inherent limitations in handling entire documents simultaneously, we first divide the original document into fixed-length chunks (e.g., 100 tokens each). These chunks con- stitute Layer 0 of our hierarchical graph, facilitating consistent and manageable retrieval. While fixed- length chunking may disrupt internal narrative co- herence, maintaining a consistent token length is crucial for retrieval. Hence, we avoid semantic chunking with variable lengths. Summarizing Chunks. Next, we group chunks (e.g., 10 chunks per group) and summarize them by instructing LLM. This summarization distills com- plex narrative passages, clarifying overall content and creating more manageable retrieval units. Entity-Relation Extraction. Then we instruct the LLM to extract entities from summarized texts and generate relational descriptions between entities. We utilize only relation descriptions for indexing and retrieval, avoiding overlapping entity descrip- tions that might disrupt narrative flow. These re- lations, functioning like atomic facts, constitute Layer 1 in the hierarchical graph, enhancing re- trieval precision due to their focused and coherent informational structure. Indexing. We assign narrative-order indices to both relation description sentences derived from summaries and to original document chunks. Re- lation descriptions are indexed according to",
    "re- lations, functioning like atomic facts, constitute Layer 1 in the hierarchical graph, enhancing re- trieval precision due to their focused and coherent informational structure. Indexing. We assign narrative-order indices to both relation description sentences derived from summaries and to original document chunks. Re- lation descriptions are indexed according to the position of their source chunks in the document and the order in which the descriptions were gener- ated, with lower indices assigned to those derived from earlier chunks or generated earlier in the pro- cess. Furthermore, each relation sentence stores the index of the original chunk it was derived from as a child index, enabling quick access to neighboring relations and original chunks. Neighborhood Assembling. We augment re- trieved relational descriptions with their surround- ing context to reconstruct a narrative flow. Rather than relying on isolated facts, we aim to provide contextually rich information. Specifically, for Layer 1 retrievals, we separate the role of the re- trieved item into a key (the relation description itself) and a value (neighboring Layer 1 passages concatenated in index order). This approach allows us to preserve a coherent local storyline rather than referencing fragmented facts. 3.2 Retrieving Passage At inference time, a query is handled through a hierarchical retrieval process that leverages the con- structed graph to assemble a rich, chronologically- aware context for the LLM. Hierarchical Retrieving. We leverage the hier- archical granularity of Layer 1 and Layer 0 for retrieval. We begin by retrieving high-precision relation descriptions from Layer 1. Then, using the associated child indices, we retrieve related Layer 0 chunks, ensuring a comprehensive and balanced context. This is crucial because Layer 0 often re- tains omitted details and original dialogues that are valuable for question answering. Answer Generation. We combine the original query with the context obtained through hierarchi- cal retrieval and feed them into the language model. Each passage is separated by double line breaks and ordered by relevance, enabling accurate and coherent answer generation. 4 Experiments 4.1 Experimental Setup Dataset. We employ the NarrativeQA (Ko\u02c7cisk`y et al., 2018) as our primary dataset. NarrativeQA comprises 355 stories and scripts with a total of 10,557 question\u2013answer pairs.

These Time Questions require retrieving and reasoning over multiple related events, making them a particularly challenging subset for temporal understanding and reasoning. Evaluation Metric. We measure answer quality using ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004), which computes the Longest Common Subsequence overlap between a generated answer and its corresponding human reference. Due to the short and pronoun-heavy nature of NarrativeQA answers, ROUGE-L effec- tively captures agreement in key word sequences without penalizing minor rephrasings. Baselines. We compare against five existing meth- ods that differ in information extraction, represen- tation, and retrieval structure: \u2022 NaiveRAG: A standard RAG pipeline that per- forms chunk-level retrieval only, without further structuring (Lewis et al., 2020). \u2022 RAPTOR: Clusters semantically similar chunks via embedding similarity and builds a recur- sive summarization tree over clusters to guide retrieval\u2014CT (Collapsed Tree) flattens each root-to-leaf path into one high-level summary, whereas TT (Tree Traversal) retains the full hi- erarchy and drills down level-by-level to gather finer-grained context (Sarthi et al., 2024). \u2022 LightRAG: Constructs a lightweight en- tity\u2013relation graph to enable fast context retrieval using dual-level extraction, prioritizing computa- tional efficiency and incremental updates (Guo et al., 2024). \u2022 GraphRAG: Builds a richer graph with detailed relation weighting and neighborhood assembly to support deeper multi-hop retrieval, capturing both high-level relation summaries and their un- derlying chunks (Edge et al., 2024). \u2022 Propositionizer: Transforms the entire source text into fine-grained propositions (atomic sen- tences) and treats each proposition as a retrieval unit, then feeds retrieved propositions into the generation model (Chen et al., 2024). Implementation Details. All baselines share iden- tical hyperparameter settings: top-k of 20 for retrieval, contextTokenLengthLimit of 1,500 to- kens, and the same sampling strategy during gen- eration. We perform all summarization and en- tity\u2013relation extraction steps with meta-llama-3- 8B-Instruct (Grattafiori et al., 2024). We com- pute retrieval scores using embedding similarity exclusively; we don\u2019t use BM25 (Robertson et al., 2009) to prevent distortion of the original text dur- ing generation. Specifically, we employ the arctic- Snowflake-embed-l (Merrick et al., 2024) for gen- erating embeddings, and use unifiedqa-v2-t5-3b- 1363200 (Khashabi et al., 2022) for final answer generation.

All retrieved contexts fed into the gen- erator respect the 1,500-token length limit to ensure fair comparison across methods. 4.2 Main Results Performance Comparison. Table 1 shows that ChronoRAG, our proposed approach outperforms on both the full NarrativeQA full dataset and the Time Question subset compared to baselines. Sum- marization based baselines such as RAPTOR-CT and RAPTOR-TT follow, but they still lag. The results indicate that restructuring events into a clear temporal order supplies the language model with the most coherent context for narrative reasoning and question answering. GraphRAG records the lowest score among all methods for several reasons. Its exhaustive entity\u2013relation extraction adds thou- sands of trivial nodes, inflating the graph and bury- ing key plot elements under noise. And it omits the covariate filtering stage, so graph expansion begins from noisy entity-relations and quickly drifts into irrelevant subgraphs. These compounded issues dilute precision so severely that GraphRAG scores lowest.

In this section, we conduct ab- lation studies to investigate the effectiveness of different components and settings of ChronoRAG. As shown in the Table 2, without summarizing the original text and extracting entity relations shows a significant performance degradation, showing the importance of chunk summarization. The effects of summarization are twofold: it leaves only impor- tant information, making retrieval easier, and when assembling, it clarifies the flow. The results without passage assembling are obtained by individually searching for entity relations extracted from the summary, while the results without chunk summa- rization are obtained by searching for entity rela- tions directly extracted from the 10 chunks. Despite not connecting nearby passages in both settings, a significant performance difference is observed in the TimeQuestion.

Our experiments revealed that this trade-off has a detrimental effect on retrieval quality. when the number of adjacent sentences included in each passage was increased to two, overall and temporal questions performance declined to 0.300 and 0.258, respectively.

Although this cost increases linearly with document length, it re- mains lower than competing methods like recursive summarization. Furthermore, only one LLM call is required for answer generation during search, with our method still attaining the highest performance despite its efficiency. Case Study.

RAPTOR retrieves summary passages, which enables access to content covering a wide range of information.

    "a wide range of information. However, these summaries frequently include information that is not pertinent to the query, or conversely, omit critical details necessary for answering the question due to length constraints imposed by the summarization process. LightRAG and GraphRAG extract entities and relations directly from the orig- inal text. In particular, GraphRAG was found to underperform compared to direct retrieval to the source chunk, likely due to its tendency to include exhaustive explanations of all elements. Propo- sitionizer and LightRAG offer relatively general- level granularity explanations, yet they still strug- gle to address questions that require understanding the changes in the relationship between Anna and George. In contrast, ChronoRAG identifies the min- imal set of chronologically adjacent passages while suppressing unrelated narrative details, illustrating its strength in maintaining temporal coherence and reducing retrieval noise. 5 Conclusion We present ChronoRAG, an RAG Framework that can effectively and efficiently handle narrative text. Our framework refines content through summariza- tion and relation extraction, and improves overall performance through simple passage augmentation that connects adjacent events via an index. This suggests that it is important not only to organize individual events and elements in narrative texts but also to connect events that are spatially and temporally close to each other.

    "CAC-CoT: Connector-Aware Compact Chain-of-Thought for Efficient Reasoning Data Synthesis Across Dual-System Cognitive Tasks Sunguk Choi* Yonghoon Kwon* Heondeuk Lee* DATUMO {sunguk.choi, yonghoon.kwon, heondeuk.lee}@selectstar.ai Abstract Long chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs) solve difficult problems, but very long traces often slow or even degrade performance on fast, intuitive \u201cSystem-1\u201d tasks. We introduce Connector- Aware Compact CoT (CAC-CoT) \u2014 a method that deliberately restricts reasoning to a small, fixed set of connector phrases, steering the model toward concise and well \u2014 structured ex- planations. Despite its simplicity, our synthetic method with Gemini-2.0-Flash yields a high- quality training quality. CAC-CoT achieves \u224885% on GSM8K and \u224840% on GPQA (System-2) while retaining \u224890% on S1- Bench (System-1). Its reasoning traces average \u2248300 tokens(ART), about one-third the length of baseline traces, delivering higher efficiency without loss of accuracy. 1 Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved striking gains on reasoning tasks by producing ex- plicit chain-of-thoughts (CoT) rationales (Wei et al., 2022). For complex problems that demand slow, an- alytical System-2 thinking, they deploy Long CoTs enriched with self-reflection, back-tracking and budget-forcing \u2014 an approach adopted by frontier systems such as OpenAI\u2019s o1 (Jaech et al., 2024), DeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al., 2025) and the inference- time scaling method s1 (Muennighoff et al., 2025a) \u2014 and one that has markedly improved performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks. Frontier LLMs such as GPT o-series, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini-2.5 Pro internalize long-chain reasoning techniques and dynamically adjust CoT length, thereby achieving state-of-the-art results on demanding benchmarks like AIME and GPQA (Jaech et al., 2024; Anthropic, 2025; Google, 2025). Recent open-source initiatives follow the same tra- jectory: projects such as RedStar (Xu et al., 2025b) *Equal contribution Figure 1: Comparison of reasoning trace generation. Most studies (top) use standard LLMs to generate ver- bose, repetitive reasoning with excessive connector us- age. In contrast, our Connector-Aware Compact CoT framework (bottom) employs explicit connector con- trol to produce concise, coherent reasoning traces with significantly fewer connectors, enabling efficient and high-quality data generation. and SkyThought (Li et al., 2025a) boost reason- ing performance by fine-tuning on large Long CoT corpora with reinforcement learning (RL), while LIMR (Li et al., 2025b) shows that carefully se- lected subsets can yield comparable gains at lower cost. Complementary work demonstrates that small and curated reasoning datasets alone can endow compact models with strong reasoning skills via supervised fine-tuning(SFT); notable examples in- clude LIMO and the inference-time scaling method s1 (Ye et al., 2025a; Muennighoff et al., 2025a). Despite their promise, integrating Long-CoT rea- soning into LLMs introduces significant drawbacks. Models fine-tuned on very long traces tend to gen- erate equally lengthy chains at inference time, a phenomenon dubbed overthinking \u2014 they continue to reason well",

Such gratuitous delib- eration inflates computation and may even degrade accuracy, as unnecessary steps accumulate noise and contradictions. Recent evaluations corroborate this trade-off: Long-CoT-optimized models excel on System-2 thinking benchmarks yet falter on in- tuitive, System-1 tasks (Zhang et al., 2025). These findings underscore a pressing need for balanced dual-system reasoning in LLMs \u2014 models must learn to invoke fast, heuristic reasoning for simple queries while reserving slow, analytical reasoning for genuinely hard problems. In this paper, we propose Connector-Aware Compact Chain-of-Thoughts (CAC-CoT), a data- generation framework that bridges the gap between exhaustive System-2 reasoning and agile System- 1 intuition. CAC-CoT prompts frontier LLMs to produce reasoning traces that (i) insert explicit con- nector sentences \u2014 e.g., \u201cLet\u2019s pause and rethink this.\u201d, \u201cHmm, that might be a dead end.\u201d \u2014 as deliberate checkpoints for self-reflection, and (ii) enforce structural compactness that discourages gratuitous length.

    "intuition. CAC-CoT prompts frontier LLMs to produce reasoning traces that (i) insert explicit con- nector sentences \u2014 e.g., \u201cLet\u2019s pause and rethink this.\u201d, \u201cHmm, that might be a dead end.\u201d \u2014 as deliberate checkpoints for self-reflection, and (ii) enforce structural compactness that discourages gratuitous length. These connectors cue the model to pause, verify, or backtrack only when necessary, preventing runaway verbosity while preserving log- ical coherence. In effect, it trains models to balance dual-system reasoning: they engage thorough an- alytical reasoning when warranted yet default to concise, intuitive responses on simpler queries. The proposed method is outlined in Figure 1. To build a high-quality CAC-CoT dataset, we leverage Gemini-2.0-Flash \u2014 a cost-efficient but capable frontier model \u2014 using a simple single- turn prompt that elicits concise, connector-rich traces. Despite the dataset\u2019s modest size and sim- plicity of the prompting strategy, fine-tuning target models on this data yields strong reasoning per- formance. The result is an exceptionally economi- cal training recipe that bypasses the need for large Long CoT corpora or complex pipelines. Comprehensive experiments confirm CAC- CoT\u2019s effectiveness. On demanding System-2 thinking benchmarks, our model attains \u224885% on GSM8K and \u224840% on GPQA (Rein et al., 2024) with Long-CoT fine-tuned specialists. On S1-Bench (Zhang et al., 2025), which stresses in- tuitive System-1 thinking, Ours reaches \u224885 %, representing an improvement of over 20% points compared to the s1.1 and LIMO baselines.. Effi- ciency follows suit: the model averages an ART of \u2248300, surpassing nearly all prior systems in computational economy. Collectively, these results demonstrate that connector-based, compact reason- ing traces are a promising foundation for future reasoning data sets and models. 2 Related works 2.1 Long Chain-of-Thought Recent advancements in CoT prompting have sig- nificantly enhanced the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing com- plex tasks into intermediate steps (Wei et al., 2022). Early work mainly relied on static, human-written exemplars, but subsequent studies introduced self- reflection and backtracking mechanisms to gen- erate longer yet more adaptive reasoning traces. For instance, Reflexion prompts an agent to store episodic self-feedback between trials (Shinn et al., 2023), whereas Self-Refine iteratively rewrites its own output until self-criticism converges (Madaan et al., 2023). Building on this idea, Pang et al. (2024) directly optimizes pairwise preferences be- tween good and bad traces, and Adarsh et al. (2024) distills high-quality rationales into smaller models via self-guided cycles of error detection and re- generation. In other research directions on Long CoT, there is ongoing debate regarding the optimal length and granularity of reasoning traces. (Yao et al., 2023a) argue that concise, structured traces improve effi- ciency without harming accuracy, whereas (Shen et al., 2025) present scaling laws showing that longer reasoning often improves performance",
    "In other research directions on Long CoT, there is ongoing debate regarding the optimal length and granularity of reasoning traces. (Yao et al., 2023a) argue that concise, structured traces improve effi- ciency without harming accuracy, whereas (Shen et al., 2025) present scaling laws showing that longer reasoning often improves performance on difficult tasks, particularly for large models. Recent observations suggest that overly lengthy reasoning traces can result in diminishing returns or even per- formance degradation due to noise accumulation and increased inference costs (Chen et al., 2025). This phenomenon, often termed overthinking, dis- proportionately hampers smaller models, which struggle to assimilate and faithfully reproduce the excessively long reasoning chains that arise when they are trained on Long CoT data (Li et al., 2025c; Wu et al., 2025; Xu et al., 2025a; Zhang et al., 2025). 2.2 Data Efficiency and Overthinking While architectural advances have driven recent gains in reasoning performance, growing evidence highlights that the structure and quality of train- ing data play an equally critical role (Li et al., 2025a; Swayamdipta et al., 2020). In particular, Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) supervision has proven effective for inducing structured rea- soning. However, such traces are often verbose, increasing both training cost and the risk of overfit- ting to unnecessary steps (Chen et al., 2025). Recent studies attempt to mitigate this verbosity by emphasizing logical sufficiency over exhaus- tiveness. For instance, Sky-T1 (Li et al., 2025a) enhances reasoning robustness by filtering out in- correct reasoning traces rather than compressing them. Meanwhile, LIMO (Ye et al., 2025a) curates high-quality datasets and applies multi-step super- vision to highlight only the essential logical steps. Although neither approach directly targets brevity, both demonstrate the potential to improve training efficiency by focusing on core reasoning content. These strategies reflect a broader trend toward data- centric LLM development, where the structure and quality of supervision play a decisive role in down- stream reasoning behavior. Despite improvements, overthinking remains a failure mode. Models often produce overly detailed reasoning even for intuitive tasks, leading to re- dundancy, inconsistencies, and degraded perfor- mance\u2014particularly on System-1 benchmarks (Sui et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025). This issue is pro- nounced in smaller models, where excessive elabo- ration introduces noise or contradictions (Yao et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2024). Even compact prompting strategies can backfire when misapplied to simple problems, underscoring the need for task-aware reasoning generation that adjusts explanation depth to problem complexity. 2.3 Dual-System Reasoning Dual-system theory distinguishes between two types of cognition: fast, intuitive System-1 rea- soning, and slow, analytical System-2 reasoning (Kahneman, 2011; Kannengiesser and Gero, 2019). Although large reasoning models excel at complex System-2 tasks, their performance often deterio- rates on simpler System-1 tasks due to unneces-",
    "problem complexity. 2.3 Dual-System Reasoning Dual-system theory distinguishes between two types of cognition: fast, intuitive System-1 rea- soning, and slow, analytical System-2 reasoning (Kahneman, 2011; Kannengiesser and Gero, 2019). Although large reasoning models excel at complex System-2 tasks, their performance often deterio- rates on simpler System-1 tasks due to unneces- sarily elaborate reasoning strategies (Zhang et al., 2025). This highlights a critical limitation\u2014current models often lack the cognitive flexibility needed to generalize across varied reasoning demands. Early attempts to address this limitation took di- vergent approaches. LIMO curated a minimal yet challenging question set requiring detailed reason- ing and manually verified each reasoning step for high-quality supervision. However, its scalability is limited by the labor-intensive nature of manual annotation. In contrast, Sky-T1 distilled reasoning patterns into fixed-length traces via offline analysis and trained LoRA adapters, sacrificing adaptability and stylistic diversity for inference simplicity. CAC-CoT adopts a different approach by re- moving reliance on learned reasoning models (LRMs) during trace generation. Instead of imitat- ing model-generated reasoning trajectories, CAC- CoT explicitly injects connector phrases into the generation process. This strategy leverages exist- ing high-quality question datasets (such as those from LIMO) while guiding models to produce concise, cognitively aligned reasoning traces. No- tably, CAC-CoT achieves this without requiring chain-level annotations or reinforcement learning, thereby promoting both training efficiency and dual-system adaptability. Its connector-driven ap- proach allows for controllable variation in reason- ing form while maintaining semantic coherence, offering a scalable path toward more flexible and cognitively grounded reasoning systems. 3 Methodology Building on recent advances in reasoning models \u2014 which demonstrate significant performance gains through mechanisms such as self-reflection, back- tracking, and self-correction \u2014 ours, CAC-CoT, adopts a structured approach that explicitly injects diverse connector phrases into the training data. By deliberately guiding the model\u2019s reasoning behav- ior through these connectors and tightly controlling the length of reasoning traces compared to conven- tional Long-CoT datasets, CAC-CoT enables the emergence of a robust dual-system reasoning capa- bility. This design allows the model to adaptively balance concise, intuitive responses for System-1 tasks with deeper, structured reasoning for System- 2 challenges, thereby achieving strong and general- izable performance across both cognitive regimes. The prompts and generation logic we used can be seen in Table 6 and Algorithm 1 of the Appendix, respectively. 3.1 Connector-Aware CoT In reasoning models, a variety of connectors (e.g., Wait, Hmm, Alternatively) are often used to facil- itate the flow of reasoning, particularly through mechanisms such as self-reflection and backtrack- ing. Inspired by this observation, we propose a data construction method that explicitly injects connec- tors into the reasoning process. This encourages the model to maintain or even enhance its reasoning performance by following a structured and reflec- tive approach.",
    "of reasoning, particularly through mechanisms such as self-reflection and backtrack- ing. Inspired by this observation, we propose a data construction method that explicitly injects connec- tors into the reasoning process. This encourages the model to maintain or even enhance its reasoning performance by following a structured and reflec- tive approach. The key components of our method are as follows: (1) Insert checkpoints after each reasoning step for reassessment; (2) use incorrect connectors at checkpoints to signal uncertainty and enable revision of faulty logic; (3) use correct con- nectors when prior logic is valid to confirm reason- ing and move forward; (4) begin with an intention- ally flawed reasoning path to promote reflective correction and generate extended traces. By prompting verification at every reasoning step and initially encouraging errors through con- nector usage, we ensure that reasoning chains re- main appropriately concise. Furthermore, by ap- plying incorrect and correct connectors as needed, we steer the process to achieve both exploration and convergence. Section 4.4 provides details on connector usage. 3.2 Compact CoT Reasoning models often suffer from excessively long reasoning traces, which can lead to inef- ficiency and even performance degradation on System-1 thinking tasks. To mitigate this issue, im- pose explicit termination constraints by limiting the number of validations, bounding the trace length, and defining clear stopping conditions. Moreover, the two types of connectors \u2014 incorrect connector and correct connector \u2014 further enhance the com- pactness of the reasoning steps, with the correct connector in particular facilitating concise progres- sion. By alternating these two types of connectors, selectively guide the model to either expand or con- verge its reasoning process. This prevents unneces- sary elaboration and encourages timely termination, preserving overall reasoning performance while significantly improving performance on System-1 tasks. The termination strategy consists of the fol- lowing rules: (1) Disallow consecutive use of con- nectors to avoid incoherent chaining of reasoning steps; (2) skip further validation if the same answer is produced more than once; (3) invoke the termi- nation condition if the reasoning becomes unclear or overly repetitive; and (4) trigger termination if the reasoning trace exceeds a predefined length or the number of validations surpasses a threshold. By preventing reasoning steps from expanding excessively, we ensure suitably concise reasoning traces. In particular, by imposing length limits and instructions to avoid overly repetitive steps, we achieve efficient reasoning. While triggering the termination condition does not directly improve ac- curacy, it prevents trace length blow-up during data generation. As shown in Section 4.4, the correct connector halts further progression upon successful inference, thereby promoting compactness. 4 Experiments 4.1 Experimental Setup In this section, we describe our experimental setup and present the main findings of the dual-system benchmark. 4.1.1 Benchmarks",

Collec- tively, these benchmarks pose problems that resist easy solutions, driving the model to explore multi- ple angles and engage in deep reasoning, making them suitable for validation analytical System-2 thinking. For intuitive System-1 thinking, we adopt S1-Bench (Zhang et al., 2025), a collection of com- monsense and rapid-inference questions that can usually be solved with minimal deliberation. By contrasting performance across these two suites, we can measure whether CAC-CoT preserves fast, concise intuition while enhancing deep analytical skill. 4.1.2 Baselines To contextualize the impact of CAC-CoT, we benchmark against three recent models that rely solely on SFT over Long-CoT data to achieve sub- stantial gains in reasoning performance via System- 2 thinking. s1.1 (Muennighoff et al., 2025a), LIMO (Ye et al., 2025a), and Bespoke-Stratos (Labs, 2025) all rely on SFT over a compact Long- CoT corpus synthesized by powerful reasoning engines (R1, R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, and QwQ, re- spectively) (Guo et al., 2025; DeepSeek-AI, 2025; Team, 2025). Despite the modest data volume, each baseline is reported to extract unexpectedly strong reasoning ability from its target model. s1.1 and Bespoke-Stratos are evaluated exactly as released in huggingface (SimpleScaling Team, 2024; Labs, 2024), maintaining full reproducibility. but, LIMO was originally demonstrated on a Qwen-2.5-7b- Instruct that was not made public; we therefore reproduce the same method in ours (s1.1 train- ing method), and perform an identical SFT run on Qwen-2.5-7b-Instruct (Team, 2024) checkpoint to ensure a fair comparison. Table 1: System 1 thinking performance across models on S1-Bench. Comparison of evaluation metrics (Acc@5, Pass@1, Success, ART) for English (EN) and Chinese (ZN) tasks. Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct is evaluated under loose formatting, while all other models are evaluated under strict formatting. CAC-CoT-7B (Ours) achieves strong accuracy with the lowest average reasoning length (ART), demonstrating superior efficiency and balanced performance across all categories.

For fine-tuning, we adopted Qwen-2.5- 7B-Instruct as the base model. Our training fol- lowed the same hyperparameter configuration used in s1.1 to ensure comparability. Further implemen- tation details, including batch size, optimizer set- tings, and training duration, are provided in the Appendix A. Datasets. We generated our training data using gemini-2.0-flash, a cost-effective yet capable fron- tier model. During the data generation process, we filtered out instances that exhibited generation er- rors or failed to follow our specified formatting instructions. As a result, the total usable output was reduced. To ensure sufficient coverage and diver- sity, we supplemented this data with samples from the LIMO and s1 datasets (Ye et al., 2025b; Muen- nighoff et al., 2025b). Specifically, we removed any duplicates between LIMO and s1 and excluded all corrupted or invalid generations. After this filter- ing process, we finalized a training set consisting of 1,391 examples. Details of the data generation process are provided in Appendix B. 4.2 System 1 Thinking As summarized in Table 1, our experiments reveal that CAC-CoT consistently achieves strong, state- of-the-art results on System-1 tasks.

    "System 1 Thinking As summarized in Table 1, our experiments reveal that CAC-CoT consistently achieves strong, state- of-the-art results on System-1 tasks. We evaluate our method on the S1-Bench suite, which consists of tasks solvable via quick, intuitive reasoning (\u201cSystem-1\u201d thinking). These tasks gen- erally require little to no step-by-step deduction, so an effective effective should answer accurately without over-elaborating. On this benchmark, it per- forms on par with or slightly better than the base- lines in terms of accuracy: all methods achieve high scores on these easier queries (as expected), but im- portantly, ours does not sacrifice performance on simple tasks despite its emphasis on CoT. In fact, CAC-CoT attains the highest overall ACC@5 and PASS@1 on S1-Bench (see Table 1), albeit with marginal improvement since the baseline perfor- mance is near-saturated. Crucially, its responses on System-1 tasks are Table 2: System 2 thinking performance across benchmarks.

Points farther toward the lower-left denote shorter, more compact traces. compact and to-the-point, highlighting adaptability. Whereas naive CoT prompting might introduce un- necessary steps or verbiage for trivial questions, our approach generates minimal reasoning \u2014 or some- times goes straight to the answer \u2014 when extensive explanation is unnecessary. Our average reasoning trace length is the shortest among all evaluated methods on S1-Bench (see Table 1, ART), indicat- ing that it avoids \u201coverthinking\u201d simple problems. This connector-aware strategy compresses rea- soning traces to roughly one-third the length of baselines while preserving \u2014 and in some cases improving \u2014 accuracy. By constraining unneces- sary expansion of the CoT, it sidesteps common overthinking pitfalls and shows that instruction- following architectures \u2014 when guided by targeted connector signals \u2014 can overcome the compliance weakness of seen in previous studies on Long CoT reasoning. Empirically, this design delivers over a 20% point accuracy gain compared to both s1.1 and LIMO, confirming its strength on straightforward System-1 tasks without sacrificing deliberative per- formance. 4.3 System 2 Thinking CAC-CoT maintains strong performance on System-2 benchmarks, demonstrating compara- ble reasoning ability to prior Long-CoT baselines.

While there is a slight performance penalty relative to baseline models \u2014 whose results are detailed in Table 2 \u2014 the overall degradation is minor, and Ours successfully preserves analytical reasoning ca- pabilities without relying on large-scale reasoning- specialized traces. A key distinction lies in the construction of our training data. Unlike existing approaches that de- pend heavily on dedicated reasoning models to generate Long-CoT corpora \u2014 often resulting in verbose outputs with excessive connector usage \u2014 it employs a connector-aware generation strat- egy based ongemini-2.0-flash, a general-purpose but instruction-aligned model. This allows us to retain the reasoning efficacy of connector-based CoT without inflating either the length of reason- ing traces or the frequency of connector insertions. As shown in Figure 2, our outputs are significantly more compact, with the CAC-CoT cluster consis- tently positioned in the lower-left region, indicat- ing fewer connectors and greater efficiency than competing models. In summary, CAC-CoT offers a principled trade-off: it slightly underperforms the strongest reasoning-optimized baselines, yet does so with far more economical prompting and with- out the bloat of overly long reasoning chains. This makes it a compelling choice for efficient, scal- able reasoning under constrained data and compute regimes.

In contrast, the light- orange highlighted phrases indicate correct connectors, which are usually followed by concretization of reasoning, confirmation of the current logic, or a transition toward final conclusions. Incorrect Connector I might have overlooked something. Let\u2019s pause and rethink this. The pattern doesn\u2019t seem obvious. Let\u2019s re-evaluate that approach. Instead of trying to find a pattern, let\u2019s try to show that there are infinitely many losing positions. This doesn\u2019t lead where we want it to. Let\u2019s pause and rethink this. Consider the Sprague-Grundy theorem. Let g(n) be the Grundy value of n pebbles. However, this might not be the right path because the problem says that \u2206Erms depends on the rms value of the component of velocity along the line of sight. We used the full kinetic energy expression, but we should have used only one component. Let\u2019s re-evaluate that approach. Now let\u2019s move to the equation for y(t). y(t) = R t 0 e\u22122(t\u2212s){2x(s) +",
    "\u2206Erms depends on the rms value of the component of velocity along the line of sight. We used the full kinetic energy expression, but we should have used only one component. Let\u2019s re-evaluate that approach. Now let\u2019s move to the equation for y(t). y(t) = R t 0 e\u22122(t\u2212s){2x(s) + 3y(s)}ds. y(t) = e\u22122t \u2217(2x(t) + 3y(t)). Taking the Laplace transform: Y (p) = L{e\u22122t}L{2x(t) + 3y(t)}. Y (p) = 1 p+2(2X(p) + 3Y (p)). Y (p) = 1 p+2(2( 2 p \u2212 1 p+1) + 3Y (p)). Y (p)(1 \u2212 3 p+2) = 2 p+2( 2 p \u2212 1 p+1). Y (p)(p+2\u22123 p+2 ) = 2 p+2(2(p+1)\u2212p p(p+1) ). Y (p)(p\u22121 p+2) = 2 p+2( p+2 p(p+1)). Y (p)(p\u22121 p+2) = 2 p+2 p+2 p(p+1). Y (p) = 2 p(p+1) p+2 p+2 1 p\u22121 p+2 . Y (p) = 2 p(p+1) p+2 p\u22121. Hmm, that might be a dead end. Y (p) = 2(p+2) p(p+1)(p\u22121). Using partial fractions: 2(p+2) p(p+1)(p\u22121) = A p + B p+1 + C p\u22121. 2(p + 2) = A(p + 1)(p \u22121) + Bp(p \u22121) + Cp(p + 1). 2p + 4 = A(p2 \u22121) + B(p2 \u2212p) + C(p2 + p). 2p + 4 = (A + B + C)p2 + (\u2212B + C)p \u2212A. Correct Connector Now that\u2019s convincing, it really does. Let us assume that for some m, 4m + 2 is a losing position. Now we want to show that we can find infinitely many numbers of the form 4m + 2 are losing. Wow, that actually makes a lot of sense now. Let an be a losing position if and only if g(an) = 0. We know g(0) = 0 and g(2) = 0, so 0 and 2 are losing positions. We want to find infinitely many losing positions. Let\u2019s find g(n) for n \u226420. Wow, that actually makes a lot of sense now. We have N = 22011 \u00b7 2025078 (mod 1000). We have 2025078 \u226178 (mod 1000). Also, we have 22011 \u2261211 (mod 1000), since 2100 \u2261376 (mod 1000). Also 210 = 1024 \u226124 (mod 1000). Then 211 = 2048 \u226148 (mod 1000). So, N \u226148 \u00b7 78 \u22613744 \u2261744 (mod 1000). Everything fits together nicely. Looks consistent with earlier steps. I think this is the correct approach using only one degree of freedom to determine the temperature. Table 4: Connector usage comparison between open- source LongCoT corpora and our corpus.

These two aspects \u2014 connector count and sequence length \u2014 serve as proxies for reasoning verbosity and structural control, and offer insight into how different models manage the trade-off between ex- pressiveness and conciseness. Table 4 summarizes connector usage and token lengths for our training corpora versus the baselines. The Bespoke dataset averages approximately 4500 tokens per reasoning trace with 5 connectors per 1000 tokens, while s1K averages around 9000 tokens and 5.5 connectors per 1000 tokens. In contrast, our connector-aware data exhibits a far more controlled structure, with an average trace length of only 1850 tokens and just 2.5 connectors per 1000 tokens. This demonstrates that our data construction method yields an efficient reasoning corpus, which in turn benefits inference. Figure 2 shows connector counts and token lengths at inference time. As evident, the compact structure of the training data carries over to outputs: on aver- age the model uses only about 20 connectors and produces fewer than 200 tokens per response. Base- line models, by comparison, sometimes exceed 500 tokens or include over 70 connectors. Together with the accuracy efficiency improvements reported in Sections 4.2 and 4.3, these results confirm that our connector-aware approach delivers both concise and efficiency reasoning. Additionally, we perform a connector-aware qualitative analysis on the generated training data. Table 3 displays how the data patterns are struc- tured before and after each connector. The first is the incorrect connector, which reflects known mechanisms such as self-reflection and backtrack- ing. Theses connectors encourage exploratory or verification-oriented reasoning. The second type is the correct connector, which signals confirmation of the current reasoning path or indicates termina- tion of the reasoning process. The segments of text that appear before and after each connector reflect its intended function, demonstrating how the logic is shaped in alignment with the connector type. 5 Conclusion We present a prompt-based, connector-aware com- pact chain-of-thought framework that automati- cally generates high-quality reasoning traces with Gemini-2.0-Flash and trains models exclusively through SFT.

By enforcing depth limits and ex- plicit connector cues, our method produces concise yet coherent rationales that improve both reliability and efficiency. Extensive experiments confirm its effectiveness: the approach consistently surpasses strong baselines across intuitive System-1 and ana- lytical System-2 benchmarks while operating with significantly lower computational overhead. Limitations The findings reported here rest on two notable con- straints. First, all experiments were performed with a single model family, Qwen, leaving open the ques- tion of whether comparable improvements would materialize for other widely used backbones such as LLaMA or Gemma. Second, all synthetic reasoning traces were gen- erated by Gemini-2.0-Flash, which risks conflat- ing the method\u2019s true contribution with biases or stylistic conventions specific to that model. Incor- porating multiple generation sources or ensemble strategies could help disentangle methodological gains from model-specific artifacts. Broadening both the range of base models and the diversity of data-generation sources would thus provide a more rigorous test of generalizability, robustness, and transferability of the proposed ap- proach.

A Implementation and Training Configuration To enable a fair comparison with existing baselines, we adopt the same training setup used for s1.1-7B (SimpleScaling Team, 2024; Muennighoff et al., 2025a) and fine-tune our model on the proposed reasoning dataset. Specifically, we use Qwen2.5- 7B-Instruct with the same hyperparameters as in prior work. The model is trained for 5 epochs with a batch size of 16 and a gradient accumulation step of 4, using four NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs.

How- ever, unlike previous datasets, our reasoning data contains relatively long samples (approximately 2,000 tokens on average), and thus we set the block size to 4,000 to ensure full context coverage dur- ing training. We also reproduce the LIMO baseline (denoted as LIMO-Reproduce) under the same hy- perparameter settings for performance comparison. The only difference is the block size, which we set to 13,000 due to the length of the input and GPU memory constraints. The full training configuration is summarized as follows: Table 5: Training Configuration Parameter Value Optimizer AdamW (\u03b21 = 0.9, \u03b22 = 0.95) Scheduler Cosine Learning Rate 1 \u00d7 10\u22125 Per Device Train Batch Size 1 Gradient Accumulation Steps 4 Block Size 4000 Weight Decay 1 \u00d7 10\u22124 Hardware 4\u00d7NVIDIA A100 (80GB) B Training Datasets Table 6 and Table 7 illustrate the exact prompt format and connector types used during the reason- ing data generation process.

In addition, Algorithm 1 outlines the constraint strategies we adopted to control the reasoning flow and ensure coherence, including how specific con- nector types were encouraged under various gen- eration conditions. To mitigate excessive data loss caused by constraint filtering, we incorporate ad- ditional samples from the s1 and LIMO datasets. We then perform a thorough deduplication across all sources to preserve the uniqueness and integrity Figure 3: Connector redundancy distribution across datasets.

Question You are playing a game. A 2 \u00d7 1 rectangle covers two adjacent squares (oriented either horizontally or vertically) of a 3 \u00d7 3 grid of squares, but you are not told which two squares are covered. Your goal is to find at least one square that is covered by the rectangle. A \"turn\" consists of you guessing a square, after which you are told whether that square is covered by the hidden rectangle. What is the minimum number of turns you need to ensure that at least one of your guessed squares is covered by the rectangle? s1.1-7B Okay, so I need to figure out the minimum number of turns required to guarantee that at least one of the guessed squares is covered by a randomly placed 2x1 rectangle on a 3x3 grid. Let me start by visualizing the problem. First, the grid is 3x3, which means there are 9 squares. The hidden rectangle is either horizontal or vertical and covers two adjacent squares. So, there are two possible orientations: the rectangle can be placed horizontally (covering two squares in a row) or vertically (covering two squares in a column). For each orientation, the possible positions vary. Let me count the number of possible rectangles. For horizontal rectangles: in a 3x3 grid, there are 2 possible rows (top or middle) and each row can have 2 starting positions (left or center). Wait, no. Wait, in a row of 3 squares, how many horizontal dominoes can be placed? Let\u2019s see. Each horizontal domino covers two adjacent squares. In a row of 3, you can place it starting at the left (covers squares 1-2) or starting at the center (covers squares 2-3). So, each row has 2 horizontal dominoes. Since there are 3 rows, but the problem says \"covers two adjacent squares\" which can be in any orientation. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says a 2x1 rectangle covers two adjacent squares. So, either horizontally or vertically. So, horizontal dominoes are in rows, vertical dominoes are in columns. So, for horizontal dominoes: each row can have 2 possible positions. There are 3 rows, so total horizontal dominoes:",
    "any orientation. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says a 2x1 rectangle covers two adjacent squares. So, either horizontally or vertically. So, horizontal dominoes are in rows, vertical dominoes are in columns. So, for horizontal dominoes: each row can have 2 possible positions. There are 3 rows, so total horizontal dominoes: 3*2 = 6. For vertical dominoes: each column can have 2 possible positions. There are 3 columns, so total vertical dominoes: 3*2 = 6. So total possible rectangles: 6 + 6 = 12. Wait, but the problem states that the rectangle is placed randomly. So, the hidden rectangle can be any of these 12 possibilities. ... Thus, the smallest hitting set requires **four** squares, ensuring all possible dominoes are covered. 4 CAC-CoT-7B Let\u2019s start with an incorrect attempt. Suppose we guess squares one by one until we find a covered square. In the worst case, we might guess squares that are not covered. The rectangle can cover at most 2 squares. So, if we guess 3 squares, at least one of them must be covered. Thus, the minimum number of turns is 3. However, this might not be the right path because it doesn\u2019t consider the optimal strategy. Let\u2019s re-evaluate that approach. We want to minimize the number of turns while guaranteeing that we find a covered square. The rectangle can be placed in different orientations (horizontal or vertical) and in different positions on the 3 \u00d7 3 grid. Consider the first turn. If we guess the center square, what is the probability that it\u2019s covered? If the rectangle is oriented horizontally, the center square is covered if the rectangle spans the middle row. If the rectangle is oriented vertically, the center square is covered if the rectangle spans the middle column. In either case, the probability is 1/3. However, knowing the center square is not covered doesn\u2019t help much. ... If we make only 3 guesses, it might happen that none of them are covered. For example, we guess the center and two squares in the same L-shaped region that does not contain the rectangle. Now that\u2019s convincing, it really does. The minimum number of turns is 4."

    "M3HG: Multimodal, Multi-scale, and Multi-type Node Heterogeneous Graph for Emotion Cause Triplet Extraction in Conversations Qiao Liang Ying Shen* Tiantian Chen Lin Zhang Tongji University, Shanghai, China {2333091, yingshen, 2111287, cslinzhang}@tongji.edu.cn\u2020 Abstract Emotion Cause Triplet Extraction in Multi- modal Conversations (MECTEC) has recently gained significant attention in social media analysis, aiming to extract emotion utterances, cause utterances, and emotion categories si- multaneously. However, the scarcity of re- lated datasets, with only one published dataset featuring highly uniform dialogue scenarios, hinders model development in this field. To address this, we introduce MECAD, the first multimodal, multi-scenario MECTEC dataset, comprising 989 conversations from 56 TV se- ries spanning a wide range of dialogue con- texts. In addition, existing MECTEC methods fail to explicitly model emotional and causal contexts and neglect the fusion of semantic in- formation at different levels, leading to per- formance degradation. In this paper, we pro- pose M3HG, a novel model that explicitly cap- tures emotional and causal contexts and ef- fectively fuses contextual information at both inter- and intra-utterance levels via a multi- modal heterogeneous graph. Extensive experi- ments demonstrate the effectiveness of M3HG compared with existing state-of-the-art meth- ods. The codes and dataset are available at https://github.com/redifinition/M3HG. 1 Introduction Emotion Cause Analysis in Conversations (ECAC) aims at identifying emotions and their causes in conversations, which is a crucial research field in natural language processing (Li et al., 2022b; Wang et al., 2023). However, most of ECAC re- search (Li et al., 2022b; Wang et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023) only focuses on the textual contexts, overlooking other modalities (So- leymani et al., 2017). * Corresponding authors. \u2020This work was supported in part by the National Natu- ral Science Foundation of China under Grant 62476202 and 62272343, in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities. To address this limitation, Wang et al. (2022) pro- posed a new task called Multimodal Emotion Cause Triplet Extraction in Conversations (MECTEC). The task aims to simultaneously identify the emo- tion utterance, the corresponding cause utterances, and the emotion category (i.e., the utter-cause- emotion triplet) from a conversation containing three modalities: text, audio, and video. Figure 1 illustrates a multimodal conversation between a mother and daughter. In this example, there are six non-neutral utterances, and consequently, six utter- cause-emotion triplets are identified. MECTEC differs from ECAC in 1) multimodal contexts (i.e., text, audio, and video) resulting in more complex emotional expression, and 2) multi-scale semantic information from overall conversation and utter- ance features like intonation and facial expressions, which pose significant challenges. Another major challenge in MECTEC is the scarcity of datasets. While numerous text-based datasets exist for ECAC, only one dataset, namely the ECF",
    "resulting in more complex emotional expression, and 2) multi-scale semantic information from overall conversation and utter- ance features like intonation and facial expressions, which pose significant challenges. Another major challenge in MECTEC is the scarcity of datasets. While numerous text-based datasets exist for ECAC, only one dataset, namely the ECF dataset (Wang et al., 2022), is specifi- cally designed for MECTEC. However, the videos in ECF are all from the Friends TV series with restricted speakers and scenarios, hindering MECTEC model development. Therefore, in this work, a new multimodal, multi-scenario MECTEC dataset, namely MECAD, is constructed. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first of its kind and will greatly facilitate research in this field. Constrained by the limited dataset, existing MECTEC models have various deficiencies. Wang et al. (2022) proposed a two-stage architecture that predicts emotion and cause utterances separately. However, this approach is computationally inten- sive and prone to error accumulation. Therefore, re- cent studies (Hu et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024a) propose one-stage architectures using graph neural networks or prompt engineering to ex- tract utter-cause-emotion triplets. However, these methods do not explicitly extract specific contexts arXiv:2508.18740v1 [cs.CL] 26 Aug 2025 Actually, this is pretty nice too. . Yan Luo: What\u2019s nice? Yunjie Wei: I haven\u2019t had your cooking in a while. Yan Luo: I\u2019ll cook for you whenever I\u2019m free! Yunjie Wei : Okay. Yan Luo: How\u2019s the job search?

Each utterance contains three different modalities - text, audio, and video. Arrows represent causal relationships that link the cause utterances to the corresponding emotion utterances. The dashed box at the bottom lists all the <utter-cause-emotion> triplets identified in this example. related to emotions and their causes. According to emotion attribution theory (Weiner, 1985), the rela- tionships of emotions and their causes are revealed by specific contexts, such as emotional words in texts, and intonations in audio and video conver- sations. For example, in Utterance 3 in Figure 1, a pleasant facial expression indicates happiness, while \u201chaven\u2019t had your cooking\u201d and a happy tone reveal the cause. The example illustrates that emo- tions and their causes depend on contextual cues across multiple modalities, highlighting the neces- sity of explicitly modeling their specific contexts. In addition, previous",
    "in Figure 1, a pleasant facial expression indicates happiness, while \u201chaven\u2019t had your cooking\u201d and a happy tone reveal the cause. The example illustrates that emo- tions and their causes depend on contextual cues across multiple modalities, highlighting the neces- sity of explicitly modeling their specific contexts. In addition, previous work (Wang et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024a; Wei et al., 2020) fail to effectively identify the cause utterances occurring after emotion utter- ances. For example, in Utterance 1 in Figure 1, the reason why Luo is happy cannot be obtained only from the historical context of Utterance 1. To find out the real cause of emotion in Utterance 1, the whole conversation should be scrutinized, which is overlooked by previous work. Furthermore, existing models (Wang et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024a) fail to adequately extract semantic information at different scales. As shown in Figure 1, the seman- tic information that reveals the relationship of an utterance and its cause not only resides in inter- connections between utterances but also resides in the intra-content of each utterance. Therefore, it\u2019s essential to comprehensively integrate seman- tic information in different scales during modality fusion. To solve the aforementioned problems, we pro- pose an MECTEC model based on the multimodal, multi-scale, and multi-type node heterogeneous graph, named M3HG. M3HG accurately extracts emotion and cause-related contexts and fuses mul- timodal, multi-scale semantic information using multimodal heterogeneous graph attention network (HGAT) with multi-type nodes. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: \u2022 The first Chinese multi-scenario MECTEC dataset, MECAD, and an online sentiment data annotation toolkit are constructed. The dataset consists of 989 conversations with 10,519 utterances annotated with important in- formation such as emotion labels, their causes, and types of emotional causes. It will greatly benefit the development of models in the MECTEC and related fields. \u2022 An efficient MECTEC model, namely M3HG, is proposed to identify utter-cause-emotion triplets from multimodal conversations. It ex- plicitly extracts specific emotion and cause- related contexts to find connections between emotions and causes. Besides, it fully inte- grates semantic information from inter and intra-utterance levels to enhance the model\u2019s predictive ability. \u2022 Extensive experiments are performed to verify the performance of our proposed model and other state-of-the-art models on MECAD and ECF datasets. Experimental results reveal that M3HG outperforms its counterparts, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our model. 2 Related Works Emotion Cause Analysis in Conversations.

Since CEE as- sumes emotion utterances are given, most related work (Poria et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022a; Zhang et al., 2022; Gu et al., 2023) viewed CEE as an ut- terance classification problem. However, because emotions of utterances are often unknown in real- world conversations, Li et al. (2022b) proposed the ECPEC task which additionally predicts emotions for the target utterances. Subsequent work (Wang et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023) has incorporated commonsense knowledge into GATs to improve the model\u2019s semantic understanding of emotions and causes, achieving better performance. Besides, some methods (Ding et al., 2020a,b; Wei et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2022) from models in the Emo- tion cause Pair Extraction (ECPE) field are also adapted for the ECPEC task. Multimodal Emotion Cause Triplet Extraction in Conversations. In recent years, multimodal con- versation scenarios on social media platforms have grown significantly, as more individuals share their lives and express emotions through live stream- ing and various online chats. To advance emotion cause analysis in multimodal conversation scenar- ios, Wang et al. (2022) introduced the MECTEC task and released the ECF dataset. However, few solutions have been proposed for this recently intro- duced task. Li et al. (2024a) incorporated emotion transition information into emotion-cause pair ex- traction using a novel labeling constraint, while Hu et al. (2024) fused semantic information across modalities via prompt engineering. These meth- ods treat multimodal fusion and contextual infor- mation extraction for emotional causes as sepa- rate processes. Furthermore, they fail to effec- tively integrate semantic information across differ- ent scales, which significantly hampers the overall performance of models in the MECTEC task. To address these issues, we propose a model that fully integrates multi-scale semantic information from different modalities, preventing the loss of con- textual information during fusion and improving triplet extraction accuracy. Datasets for the ECAC Task. Table 1 summarizes popular datasets in ECAC. Poria et al. (2021) in- troduced the RECCON dataset for the ECAC task, and Li et al. (2022b) extended it by building the ConvECPE dataset. Given the multimodal nature of conversations, Wang et al. (2022) developed the ECF dataset for MECTEC.

Compared with ECF (Wang et al., 2022), MECAD has more diverse conversation scenarios. In addition to labeling emo- tion categories and their causes for each utterance, we also categorized the types of emotion causes (e.g., event, expression) and the modality of anno- tation (i.e., text, audio, or video) to support future studies in multimodal emotion cause analysis. We selected the publicly available M3ED (Zhao et al., 2022) dataset as our data source, which con- tains 990 segments from 56 Chinese TV series. However, M3ED dataset only contains conversa- tion scripts, audios, and screenshots, lacking cor- responding videos. Therefore, we endeavored to collect the corresponding video segments based on the conversation timestamps provided by M3ED. We concatenated sentences to form 989 multimodal conversations with 10,516 full utterances. We invited 10 Chinese graduate students ma- jored in Psychology to annotate the corresponding cause utterances, the types of emotion causes and the modal cues of annotations in the conversations. To obtain high-quality annotations, we designed detailed guidelines based on previous studies (Dir- ven, 1997; Steptoe and Brydon, 2009), trained the volunteers, and tested them with annotation cases. Only those passing the test participated in the final annotation process. Each volunteer was paid $50 for their annotations. Then, we randomly assigned three qualified annotators for each conversation. If divergence exists among annotations from different volunteers, the final annotation for the utterance is determined by majority voting. Two strategies were used to review and revise incorrect annota- tions: 1) Annotation consistency among the three annotators for each TV series is calculated. For se- ries with low consistency, the annotators rechecked and revised their labels as needed. 2) If disagree- ments remained, a fourth annotator was invited to relabel the utterances and make the final decision. To enhance annotation efficiency and accuracy, we developed an online multimodal conversation emotion cause annotation tool. The interface of the annotation tool is shown in Figure 3 in Appendix B. This tool is highly reusable and user-friendly, mak- ing it ideal for related research in the future. We use Cohen\u2019s Kappa (Cohen, 1960) to assess pairwise agreement and Fleiss\u2019s Kappa (McHugh, 2012) for overall consistency",

We use Cohen\u2019s Kappa (Cohen, 1960) to assess pairwise agreement and Fleiss\u2019s Kappa (McHugh, 2012) for overall consistency among annotators. The Cohen\u2019s Kappa results are in Appendix A, and the Fleiss\u2019s Kappa score of 0.6932 exceeds the threshold of 0.61 (Landis, 1977), confirming the statistical reliability of our annotations. The dataset statistics and detailed analysis of MECAD are presented in Figure 4 in Appendix A. MECAD provides solid support for assessing the performance and generalization capabilities of MECTEC models in broader scenarios. 4 Framework of Proposed M3HG 4.1 Task Definition Given a conversation C = {(Si, Ui)}1\u2264i\u2264n, where Si denotes the speaker of the i-th utterance Ui, n denotes the length of the conversation C, Ui = {Ut i , Ua i , Uv i }, and t, a, v are the text, audio and video modality, respectively. The goal of MECTEC is to identify all the utter-cause-emotion triplets from the conversation C: P = {(U e j , U c j , ye j)}, (1) where U e j is the j-th utterance with emotion ye j, U c j is the corresponding cause utterance, and ye j \u2208 {Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise} (Ek- man, 1992). 4.2 Model Overview M3HG is an end-to-end (E2E) MECTEC model, as illustrated in Figure 2. It consists of four key com- ponents: unimodal feature extraction, graph con- struction, multi-scale semantic fusion, and emotion- cause classification. In unimodal feature extraction, M3HG extracts local contextual representations for each utterance using modality-specific feature extractors and uni- modal encoders. In graph construction, M3HG constructs a conversation interaction graph using these feature representations to explicitly model the emotion and cause-related contexts. In multi- scale semantic fusion, M3HG combines semantic information at different scales within the conversa- tion interaction graph to produce a comprehensive feature representation of both emotion and cause contexts. In emotion-cause classification, emo- tion and cause contextual representations are con- catenated and used to extract utter-cause-emotion triplets with with position embedding. 4.3 Unimodal Feature Extraction First, we utilize SA-RoBERTa (Gu et al., 2020), Wav2Vec2 (Baevski et al., 2020), and DenseNet (Huang et al., 2017) to extract three fea- ture representations Et, Ea, and Ev, from text, audio, and video, respectively, where Et \u2208Rn\u00d7dt, Ea \u2208Rn\u00d7da, and Ev \u2208Rn\u00d7dv, and dt, da, dv represent dimensions of the hidden layer represen- tations of the three modalities. The extraction pro- cess is described in Appendix C.1. Then, we encode each feature representation within an unimodal local context. For text, we apply multi-head self-attention (Vaswani, 2017)",
    "\u2208Rn\u00d7dt, Ea \u2208Rn\u00d7da, and Ev \u2208Rn\u00d7dv, and dt, da, dv represent dimensions of the hidden layer represen- tations of the three modalities. The extraction pro- cess is described in Appendix C.1. Then, we encode each feature representation within an unimodal local context. For text, we apply multi-head self-attention (Vaswani, 2017) to Et to capture local contextual information, result- ing in Ht. For Ea and Ev, we use a GRU-based network (Li et al., 2024b) to extract local context by leveraging the RNN structure\u2019s capability to handle temporal features, which is expressed as: E\u2032m = LN(Em + GRU(Em)), Hm = LN(Em + E\u2032m + FFN(E\u2032m), (2) where Hm \u2208Rn\u00d7dm, m \u2208{a, v}, LN denotes layer normalization, and FFN denotes a feedfor- ward neural network. After encoding the local context for each modal- ity, we obtain the sequence representations Ht, Ha, Hv for text, audio, and video. We then apply three linear layers to map Ht, Ha, Hv to H\u2032t, H\u2032a, H\u2032v with the same dimension dh. 4.4 Graph Construction To enable M3HG to fuse multi-scale semantic in- formation across modalities, we construct a het- erogeneous graph that represents both inter- and intra-utterance connections, as well as cross-modal interactions. The structure of this heterogeneous graph can be denoted by G = (V, E, R), where V is the node set consisting of all graph nodes vi, R is the relation set consisting of all relations rij be- tween any two nodes vi and vj, and E is the edge set consisting of all edges represented as (vi, rij, vj). \ud835\udc7c\ud835\udfcf \ud835\udc95 \ud835\udc7c\ud835\udfd0 \ud835\udc95 \ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc95 . . . \ud835\udc6f\ud835\udfcf \"\ud835\udc95 \ud835\udc6f\ud835\udfd0 \"\ud835\udc95 \ud835\udc6f\ud835\udc8f\"\ud835\udc95 . . .

It consists of three main components: unimodal feature extraction, graph construction and multi-scale semantic fusion, and emotion-cause classification. Nodes. To explicitly model emotion and cause- related contexts in conversations, we model them as emotional context nodes Ne and causal con- text nodes Nc, respectively. To enable G to accu- rately perceive the conversation information, we model the whole conversation as a conversation node. Each utterance is represented by an utter- ance node. Both the utterance node and conversa- tion node are designed as Super-Nodes containing these modalities, denoted as SNu and SNd, since they contain three modal features. Therefore, G contains four types of nodes: Ne, Nc, SNu and SNd. Ne and Nc are first initialized with textual se- quence representations H\u2032t, then updated with con- textual information from the other two modalities, which is described in Section 4.5. Each utter- ance Super-Node SNu = {Nt, Na, Nv} is initial- ized using H\u2032t, H\u2032a, H\u2032v. The conversation node SNd = {Nt d, Na d , Nv d } is initialized by averaging H\u2032t, H\u2032a, H\u2032v to capture global information. Edges and Relations. There are five types of Super-Edges connecting the aforementioned Super- Nodes: same speaker (rss), different speaker (rds), global connection (rgc), emotion connection (rec) and cause connection (rcc). The same speaker edge connects the utterance Super-Nodes SNu from the same speaker. Inspired by the work of Shen et al. (2021), we define the local context as K preceding utterances from the same speaker of SNu, where K is a hyper-parameter. The different speaker edge connects the utterance Super-Nodes within the lo- cal context from different speakers to SNu. The bidirectional global connection edge connects all the utterance Super-Nodes SNus with the conver- sation Super-Node SNd, facilitating the propaga- tion of global contextual information. The emotion connection edge and the cause connection edge connect SNu with its corresponding emotional context node Ne and causal context node Nc, re- spectively. They explicitly capture the emotion and cause context specific to each utterance. M3HG is the first MECTEC model capable of handling situations where cause utterances ap- pear after emotion utterances, as each utterance is linked through the global connection node. The detailed experiments in Appendix E.2 further val- idate this capability. The pseudo-code of graph construction and a constructed graph for the con- versation in Figure 1 are provided in Appendix C.2 and Appendix C.3, respectively. The graph con- struction process of M3HG can be expressed as: G = (V, E, R), V = {SNu i , Ne i , Nc i , SNd}1\u2264i\u2264n, SNu",

The graph con- struction process of M3HG can be expressed as: G = (V, E, R), V = {SNu i , Ne i , Nc i , SNd}1\u2264i\u2264n, SNu i = {Nt i , Na i , Nv i }, SNd = {Nt d, Na d , Nv d }, R = {rss, rds, rgc, rec, rcc}, E = {(vi, rij, vj)}, vi, vj \u2208V, r \u2208R, (3) where superscripts u, e, c, d denote node types, and m denotes three modalities. Based on the con- structed graph G, the emotion and cause contexts are effectively modeled. (3 | 4.5 Multi-scale Semantic Information Fusion Based on graph G, we designed a comprehensive approach to integrate semantic information across different modalities and scales. This mechanism is implemented in two levels: intra-utterance fu- sion which captures emotion and cause-related con- texts within utterances, and inter-utterance fusion which propagates semantic information among ut- terances and conversation-level contexts. Both lev- els leverage HGAT (Wang et al., 2019) to propa- gate and fuse semantic information through vari- ous meta-paths (Wang et al., 2019) within G. This ensures thorough updates to node features by inte- grating multi-scale semantic information. The meta-paths in G are defined as: \u03a6 = {\u03d5(vi, rij, vj)}, vi, vj \u2208V, \u03d5(vi, rij, vj) = vi rij \u2190\u2192vj, rij \u2208R, (4) where \u03d5(vi, rij, vj) represents all paths that con- nect node vi to node vj via edge type rij. Intra-utterance-level Fusion. As shown in Fig- ure 2, for each utterance Super-Node SNu, we perform intra-utterance-level fusion by integrating semantic information within the utterance. We de- fine the meta-path \u03a6intra for intra-utterance-level semantic fusion for SNu n as: \u03a6intra ={\u03d5 (Nm1, Nm2, rm1,m2)} \u222a{\u03d5 (Nm, Ne, rm,e)} \u222a{\u03d5 (Nm, Nc, rm,c)}, (5) where m1, m2, m \u2208{t, a, v}, Nm represents the nodes of modality m within the SNu, and rm1,m2 denotes the edges connecting Nm1 and Nm2. rm,e denotes edges connecting nodes Nm to the emo- tional context nodes Ne, facilitating the aggrega- tion of emotional contexts conveyed by different modalities within the utterance. Similarly, rm,c rep- resents the edges that connect Nm to the causal con- text nodes Nc, enabling the aggregation of causal contexts. \u03a6intra effectively models the process of semantic information fusion in a single utterance. Next, we incorporate node-level attention into \u03a6intra. For each meta-path in \u03a6intra and nodes vi \u2208{Nm, Ne, Nc}, the importance of its neigh- bors Ni in \u03a6intra is computed as: \u03b1\u03d5 ij = exp \u0000\u03c3 \u0000aT \u03d5 \u00b7 \u0002 H\u2032 i \u2225H\u2032 j \u0003\u0001\u0001 P k\u2208N \u03d5 i exp \u0010 \u03c3 \u0010",
    "incorporate node-level attention into \u03a6intra. For each meta-path in \u03a6intra and nodes vi \u2208{Nm, Ne, Nc}, the importance of its neigh- bors Ni in \u03a6intra is computed as: \u03b1\u03d5 ij = exp \u0000\u03c3 \u0000aT \u03d5 \u00b7 \u0002 H\u2032 i \u2225H\u2032 j \u0003\u0001\u0001 P k\u2208N \u03d5 i exp \u0010 \u03c3 \u0010 aT \u03d5 \u00b7 [H\u2032 i \u2225H\u2032 k] \u0011\u0011, \u03d5 \u2208\u03a6intra, (6) where \u03c3 denotes the activation function, and a\u03d5 is the node-level attention vector of meta-path \u03d5. The node representation of vi based on meta-path \u03d5 is obtained by: Zi = \u03c3( X j\u2208N \u03d5 i \u03b1\u03d5 ij \u00b7 H\u2032 j). (7) This process yields the contextual features Zi \u2208 R1\u00d7dh for nodes vi under the intra-utterance-level meta-paths \u03a6intra. Inter-utterance-level Fusion. As illustrated in Fig- ure 2, for any two utterance Super-Nodes SNu i and SNu j in G, along with the conversation Super-Node SNd, we perform inter-utterance-level fusion by connecting SNu i and SNu j to SNd, thereby inte- grating contextual information across utterances. We define meta-paths \u03a6inter for inter-utterance- level fusion between SNu and SNd: \u03a6inter ={\u03d5(Nm1 i , Nm2 j , rm1,m2)} \u222a{\u03d5(Nm i , Nm d , rd,m)} \u222a{\u03d5(Nm j , Nm d , rd,m)}, (8) where m1, m2, m \u2208{t, a, v}, Nm i and Nm j rep- resent the nodes of modality m inside SNu i and SNu j , respectively, rm1,m2 denotes the edges con- necting Nm1 i and Nm2 j , and rd,m represents the edges connecting SNus to SNd in modality m. The utterance information from each modality can be passed to SNd though \u03a6inter, which ac- complishes inter-utterance-level fusion between ut- terances. As a result, SNd comprehensively inte- grates information across all three modalities. The meta-path set \u03a6inter models multimodal connec- tions between utterances, enabling conversation information aggregated in G. Similar to Eq. 6 and Eq. 7, the contextual repre- sentations of SNu and SNd are obtained under the meta-path \u03a6inter by the node-level attention block. After performing multi-scale semantic fusion with \u03a6intra and \u03a6inter, we apply the semantic at- tention mechanism (Wang et al., 2019) to each node embedding Zi, integrating multi-scale semantic information from all three modalities. Following (Chen et al., 2023), each fusion iteration is followed by a position-wise feed-forward network (PFFN) layer, which updates node features through a non- linear transformation. The emotional context node representation Ze i and the causal context node fea- ture representation Zc i can be obtained at the end of iterations of the multi-scale semantic fusion and PFFN layers. 4.6 Emotion-cause classification For each utterance Ui, its Ze i and Zc i are fed into the emotion-specific Multi-Layer Perceptron (Emo- tion MLP) and the cause-specific Multi-Layer Per- ceptron (Cause MLP) to",
    "Zc i can be obtained at the end of iterations of the multi-scale semantic fusion and PFFN layers. 4.6 Emotion-cause classification For each utterance Ui, its Ze i and Zc i are fed into the emotion-specific Multi-Layer Perceptron (Emo- tion MLP) and the cause-specific Multi-Layer Per- ceptron (Cause MLP) to predict its emotion cate- gory \u02c6ye i and the cause indicator \u02c6yc i which indicates whether Ui can be a cause utterance. For each utterance pair Ui and Uj, we compute a relative position encoding RPEij to capture the positional relationship between Ui and Uj. We utilize the RBF kernel function (Wei et al., 2020) to compute RPEij, which captures the relative positional rela- tionships between utterances through a nonlinear relation. Ze j , Zc i and RPEij are then concatenated and fed into a new MLP to determine whether Ui is the cause utterance of Uj: \u02c6yec ij = \u03c3(MLP(Zj e||Zic||RPEij). (9) \u02c6yec ij represent the binary classification logits indicat- ing whether Ui is the cause of Uj. Based on \u02c6yec ij , we can determine whether Uj, Ui and \u02c6ye j can form a true utter-cause-emotion triplet. 4.7 Training We use Focal loss (Ross and Doll\u00e1r, 2017) to cope with category imbalance in emotion-cause classi- fication. Specifically, the loss of both emotion prediction and cause utterance prediction and the emotion-cause pair prediction, can be expressed as: L\u03b2 = \u22121 N\u03b2 N\u03b2 X i=1 \u03b1\u03b2(1\u2212\u02c6y\u03b2 i )\u03b3 log(\u02c6y\u03b2 i ), \u03b2 \u2208{e, c, ec} (10) where \u03b2 represents the task type, N\u03b2 denotes the corresponding sample number of \u03b2, \u03b1\u03b2 is the cate- gory balancing factor, and \u03b3 denotes the Focal loss modulation parameter. These three training losses are optimized jointly during the training process. 5 EXPERIMENTS 5.1 Experimental Settings We conduct extensive experiments on two MECTEC benchmark datasets, i.e., ECF (Wang et al., 2022) and MECAD, which both contain data of three modalities: text, audio, and video. Similar to (Wang et al., 2022), we evaluate the model\u2019s overall performance using the F1 score. The F1 score is computed for utter-cause-emotion triplets within each emotion category separately. Then the weighted average F1 score is calculated across all six emotion categories which is referred to 6 Avg. In addition, as in (Wang et al., 2023), considering the data imbalance among different emotion cat- egories, we also report the weighted average F1 scores for the four main emotion categories except Disgust and Fear, which is referred to 4 Avg.

    "and Fear, which is referred to 4 Avg. The implementation details of the experiment are given in Appendix D. 5.2 Baselines Due to the limited research on the MECTEC task, representative approaches in related fields of Emo- tion Cause Pair Extraction (ECPE) and Emotion Cause Pair Extraction in Conversations (ECPEC) are considered. The ECPE and ECPEC tasks aim to extract emotion-cause pairs from plain texts and conversations, respectively. We compare our model with seven baselines: 1) MC-ECPE-2steps (Wang et al., 2022) is a two-step MECTEC architecture, which first ex- tracts emotion utterances and cause utterances sep- arately, and then performs pairing and filtering to identify emotion-cause pairs. 2) HiLo (Li et al., 2024a) is one of the SOTA approaches for the MECTEC task, which fully utilizes conversion information through a labeling constraint mech- anism. 3) ECPE-2D (Ding et al., 2020a) is an E2E framework for ECPE that uses 2D-Transformer to model the interactions of emotion-cause pairs. 4) RankCP (Wei et al., 2020) is a GAT-based ap- proach for ECPE to extract emotion-cause pairs by ranking. 5) UECA-Prompt (Zheng et al., 2022) is one of the SOTA methods for ECPE, which decom- poses the task into multiple objectives and converts them into sub-prompts. 6) SHARK (Wang et al., 2023) is the SOTA method for ECPEC that incor- porates commonsense into GATs to improve the model\u2019s semantic understanding of emotions and causes. 7) GPT-4o is one of the most powerful large language models (LLMs) for open-domain conversations.

Since HiLo (Li et al., 2024a) is not publicly available, we only report the results of HiLo on the ECF dataset. best performance, indicating that the E2E frame- work is more effective compared to the two-step pipeline frameworks. In contrast, M3HG adopting three modalities outperforms the SOTA E2E model HiLo, with 21.28% and 17.17% improvement in 6 Avg and 4 Avg scores, respectively. We attribute this improvement to M3HG\u2019s ability to effectively extract semantic information at inter-utterance and intra-utterance levels, which enables the model to accurately pair emotion utterances and cause ut- terances. Specifically, in two challenging emotion categories which have limited training samples, i.e. Disgust and Fear, M3HG also exhibits high per- formances. For example, compared to GPT-4o, which achieved the second highest F1 scores in the Disgust and Fear categories, M3HG shows im- provements of 31.36% and 58.46%, respectively. When only incorporating the text modality, the 6 Avg and the 4 Avg scores of M3HG are 37.46 and 39.95. When incorporating audio and video with the text modality separately, the performance of M3HG is improved to 39.10, 38.90 of 6 Avg scores and 40.97, 40.72 of 4 Avg scores. When incorporating all three modalities, M3HG achieves the highest performance with 40.07 of 6 Avg scores and 41.96 of 4 Avg scores.

As shown in Table 2, M3HG also achieves the highest results on the MECAD dataset. Compared to the second best model SHARK, M3HG adopting three modalities achieves the improvement of 19% on the 6 Avg scores and 15.34% on the 4 Avg score. Furthermore, despite GPT-4o\u2019s superior semantic comprehension abilities, its performance on the MECAD dataset remains suboptimal, with its 6 Avg score and 4 Avg score of 27.16 and 28.42. Therefore, the few-shot- based LLM approach still struggles to effectively handle the MECTEC task. As shown in Table 2, M3HG exhibits a universal highest performance on the MECAD dataset, demonstrating the superiority and robustness of M3HG when dealing with multi- conversation scenarios. More detailed experimental results and the abla- tion study on M3HG are presented in Appendix E. 6 Conclusion In this work, we propose the first multimodal and multi-scenario Chinese emotion-cause analysis dataset, MECAD, for MECTEC and related emo- tion cause analysis tasks. Compared to ECF, the only existing dataset for multimodal emotion-cause analysis, MECAD offers more diverse conversation scenarios. It helps to enhance the generalizability and applicability of MECTEC models in complex social media environments. Moreover, MECAD is a valuable resource for cross-cultural emotion analysis and recognition. Furthermore, we propose a generalized MECTEC framework named M3HG, which deeply extracts emotional and causal con- texts, while effectively integrating semantic infor- mation across multiple granular levels. Extensive experiments on the ECF dataset and the MECAD dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods. Limitations There are also some potential limitations in this work. First, the process of emotional and causal context extraction does not integrate external knowledge, which limits the model\u2019s accuracy for emotion prediction and cause prediction. In the future, we plan to integrate external knowledge into our model and leverage the advanced seman- tic extraction capabilities of current LLM technol- ogy to facilitate deeper and more precise emotion cause analysis. Second, M3HG cannot handle ex- cessively long conversations, as its input length is constrained by the language model used. Further- more, M3HG may suffer from error propagation in the multimodal fusion process when emotion labels have uneven information across modalities. This imbalance can lead to inaccurate predictions, espe- cially when modalities conflict. This challenge is common in current multimodal models for emotion- cause",

This imbalance can lead to inaccurate predictions, espe- cially when modalities conflict. This challenge is common in current multimodal models for emotion- cause analysis and suggests an area for future im- provement. Ethical Considerations We did not use real-world conversations in our data collection because such conversations may violate the privacy of the speaker. The effect of recruiting actors to play the roles is the same as in the TV series, but the scenes are not as diverse as in the TV series. Therefore, we use TV series as the data source. To further protect privacy, all data annotations were anonymized and de-identified, ensuring that our data collection adheres to ethical standards.

A Dataset Statistics and Analysis of MECAD To ensure the annotation quality of MECAD, we calculated Cohen\u2019s kappa (Cohen, 1960) scores for every co-annotated data between two annotators, as shown in Figure 4. The Cohen\u2019s kappa (Cohen, 1960) scores across all annotators are consistently around 0.6, indicating a good level of annotation consistency. After the labeling was completed, we computed Cohen\u2019s kappa scores separately for data that were not co-labeled between the two labelers, as shown in Figure 4. Table 3 lists some statistics of the MECAD dataset. The dataset contains a total of 989 conversations, 10,516 utterances, and 8,077 emotion cause pairs from 56 different TV series, which ensures the size and diversity of the dataset. Similar to M3ED (Zhao et al., 2022), we used TV- independent data segmentation to ensure the abil- ity to validate model robustness as a benchmark dataset. The average number of utterances and the average length of an utterance of a conversation are similar in the training, validation, and test sets. At the same time, we can find that the average relative positions of the emotion cause pairs are all around Figure 3: The interface of the developed online multi- modal conversation emotion cause annotation toolkit. a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6 a7 a8 a9 a10 a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6 a7",

To allow conversations that exceed the max- imum input sequence length of the PLM to retain as much contextual information as possible when they are fed into the PLM, we sequentially truncate the last tokens of the maximum-length utterances of the conversation during preprocessing until the maximum sequence length requirement of the PLM is met. The input sequence Xt is then fed into the PLM to obtain a sequential representation of the entire conversation: It = PLM(Xt), (11) where It \u2208RL\u00d7dt, L is the length of the in- put sequence and dt is the hidden dimension of the PLM. To obtain the sequence representation of each utterance, we make a weighted average of the sequence representations of the tokens of each conversation in It to obtain the sequence rep- resentation of each utterance Et \u2208RN\u00d7dt,where N denotes the number of utterances of that con-",
    "hidden dimension of the PLM. To obtain the sequence representation of each utterance, we make a weighted average of the sequence representations of the tokens of each conversation in It to obtain the sequence rep- resentation of each utterance Et \u2208RN\u00d7dt,where N denotes the number of utterances of that con- versation. We selected Speaker-Aware RoBERTa (SA-RoBERTa) (Gu et al., 2020) as the PLM. Audio : After resampling the audio to 16khz, we input it into an audio feature extraction model (AFE) to get a sequential representation of the au- dio modality of the conversation: Ea = AFE(Xa), (12) where Ea \u2208Rn\u00d7da, and da is the hidden layer dimension of the audio feature extraction model. We choose Wav2Vec2.0 (Baevski et al., 2020) as the audio feature extraction model. Video: We first sample the video at equal inter- vals as a sequence of images over several frames to obtain the input sequence Xv, Xv \u2208RF\u00d7df\u00d7df of the video modality, where F is the number of sampled frames and df is the size of the picture. The image sequences are then fed into the video feature extraction model (VFE) to get a sequence representation of the video modalities: Ev = V FE(Xv), (13) where Ev \u2208Rn\u00d7dv and dv is the hidden layer dimension of the video feature extraction model. We select the pre-trained DenseNet (Huang et al., 2017) as the audio feature extraction model.

D Implement Details of the Experiment For the ECF dataset, we use the pre-trained RoBERTa-large2 model to initialize the fea- ture extraction parameters of the text modality. For audio modality, we use the wav2vec2-base- 960h3 model and for video modality we use the DenseNet (Huang et al., 2017) model. For the MECAD dataset, we use the chinese-roberta-wwm- ext-large4 model for the initialization of textual modal features, the wav2vec2-large-chinese-zh-cn5 model for the extraction of audio modal features, and the DenseNet model is also applied to the video modal. In our experiments, none of the parameters of the PLM were frozen. During the construction of the graph, we set the hyperparameter K to 3. 2https://huggingface.co/FacebookAI/ roberta-large 3https://huggingface.co/facebook/ wav2vec2-base-960h 4https://huggingface.co/hfl/ chinese-roberta-wwm-ext-large 5https://huggingface.co/wbbbbb/ wav2vec2-large-chinese-zh-cn During training, we use the AdamW (Loshchilov, 2017) optimizer with batch size and learning rate set to 16 and 5e-6, respectively, and perform a pa- rameter update after every two mini-batches. Our model is trained for 50 epochs on the training set, and the checkpoints corresponding to the highest values of the weighted average F1 scores of the six emotions on the validation set are used as the results of the test set. E Supplementary Experimental Results of M3HG E.1 Ablation Study Effect of different modules. We conduct abla- tion studies to verify the effectiveness of differ- ent modules in M3HG on the two datasets using 6 Avg and 4 Avg scores. As shown in Table 6, w/o Ne&Nc indicates no use of emotional and causal context nodes in graph construction. Consequently, emotion-cause pair prediction is performed directly based on the features of each utterance node. w/o inter-fusion and w/o intra-fusion denote the ab- sence of inter-utterance and intra-utterance multi- modal fusion, respectively, during multi-scale se- mantic information fusion. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines even without utiliz- ing the previous three mechanisms. Specifically, the performance of M3HG degrades on both ECF and MECAD datasets when removing the emo- tional and causal context nodes, demonstrating the necessity of explicitly modeling the emotion and cause-related contexts. Moreover, removing both intra-utterance and inter-utterance semantic fusion results in a drop in the model\u2019s performance, the former of which causes a more significant degrada- tion. It highlights the importance of effectively fus- ing semantic information at different scales within heterogeneous graphs, particularly within individ- ual",

Effect of the hyperparameter K. The hyperpa- rameter K is closely related to the spatio-temporal complexity of the M3HG\u2019s graph construction. We vary the size of K (ranging from 1 to 6) to test its effect, and the result of the M3HG on both datasets is shown in Figure 7. The performance of M3HG on both datasets initially improves with increasing K and then declines, with the best performance observed at K = 3. E.2 In-Depth Analysis The impact of conversation length. To evaluate the performance of M3HG in handling longer con- versations, we present a comparison of the perfor- mance of M3HG and other baseline models across conversations of varying lengths, as shown in Ta- ble 4. We observe that M3HG outperforms all base- line models in scenarios involving conversations with more than 10 utterances, which account for Table 7: Performance comparison of different methods for conversations in which cause utterance appears after emotion utterances.

In long con- versations, baseline models, including GPT-4o, fail to effectively extract global contextual information, thereby missing a number of triplets. Our model, through semantic fusion at different scales within multimodal heterogeneous graphs, effectively cap- tures more triplets by extracting contextual infor- mation from long conversations. Model performance when cause utterance ap- pears after emotion utterances. A key chal- lenge in the MECTEC task is when the cause of a speaker\u2019s emotion is revealed later in the conver- sation, requiring the model to effectively capture and interpret the global context of the conversation. To further emphasize the superior performance of M3HG in handling cases where the cause utterance appears after the emotion utterance, we identified and filtered all such conversations from the ECF and MECAD datasets. The performance of M3HG, compared with two other representative models, is shown in Table 7. M3G demonstrates superior performance, while SHARK suffers a greater per- formance drop compared to M3HG. Although the performance drop for GPT-4o (5-shots) is less pro- nounced, its overall performance remains unsatis- factory. Model performance on four subtasks.

Table 5 demonstrates the performance compari- son between M3HG and other SOTA models across the four subtasks. For the EP subtask, M3HG per- forms the best across both datasets. It is worth noting that GPT-4o (5-shots) achieves a high re- call on the ECF dataset. This phenomenon can be attributed to the more pronounced label sparsity in the ECF dataset compared to MECAD. As a result, GPT-4o (5-shots) frequently predicts that an utterance carries emotion, leading to a higher recall. For the ER subtask, M3HG achieves the best results across both datasets. This demonstrates M3HG\u2019s ability to effectively extract the emotional context embedded in utterances. For the CE sub- task, M3HG performs best, demonstrating the im- portance of integrating the cause prediction subtask into the model during training. For the EC subtask, GPT-4o (5-shots) similarly exhibits high recall on the ECF dataset. This is due to the severe label sparsity problem in the ECF dataset, compared to MECAD, which leads GPT-4o to predict as many emotion-cause pairs as possible. E.3 Case Study To demonstrate the superiority and limitations of M3HG, we present a case study that compares the prediction results of M3HG with those of two other representative models (i.e. SHARK, GPT-4o (5- shots)), using two sample conversations from the MECAD dataset. As shown in Figure 8, the first test sample demonstrates that M3HG outperforms the other models in prediction accuracy, while GPT- 4o exhibits the poorest performance. This can be attributed to M3HG\u2019s use of",
    "other representative models (i.e. SHARK, GPT-4o (5- shots)), using two sample conversations from the MECAD dataset. As shown in Figure 8, the first test sample demonstrates that M3HG outperforms the other models in prediction accuracy, while GPT- 4o exhibits the poorest performance. This can be attributed to M3HG\u2019s use of a multimodal het- erogeneous graph and a specially designed con- versation super-node, which effectively captures global contextual information. These features en- able M3HG to more accurately handle scenarios where the cause utterance appears after the emotion utterance. In the second sample, M3HG (T+A+V) is less effective than M3HG (T) in predicting Utterance 6 as \u201cSad\u201d and Utterance 2 as \u201cNeutral\u201d. This is because the combination of text and context in Ut- terance 2 conveys the speaker\u2019s worried and fearful mood, while the video and audio signals suggest a Table 8: An example of prompt for ChatGPT. Input Instruction You are an expert in sentiment analysis and identification of emotional causes. I will give you a conversation between multiple speakers. You are required to extract the utter-cause-emotion triplet for a given utterance. First, infer the emotion label for the utterance (select one from: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise or Neutral). Then, identify the index(es) of the cause utterance(s) that triggered this emotion (the index should represent the utterance(s) from the conversation that caused the emotion, and it must be non- negative. Multiple indices should be separated by commas). If the predicted emotion is Neutral, there is no corresponding cause utterance. The output should follow the format: emotion label, cause utterance indices. Examples of the expected output format: Example 1: happy,3. Example 2: sad,3,4,5. Example 3: neutral. Demonstrations Input Conversation : { 1. Fang Sijin: First, change your clothes, then head to this address. A decoration company will be coming over shortly. You\u2019ll need to supervise their work and see how you can help. } { 2. Zhu Shanshan: Wait, am I really responsible for this? I don\u2019t know anything about decoration. } { 3. Fang Sijin: You\u2019ve been handing out flyers for two days now. Have you gotten any interested customers? } { 4. Zhu Shanshan: But you only told me to distribute the flyers; you never ask for phone numbers! } Candidate Utterances: { 1. Fang Sijin: First, change your clothes, then head to this address.

This discrepancy likely caused M3HG (T+A+V) to mispredict the emotions in this case. Nevertheless, M3HG still outperforms all other baseline models, demonstrating its robust- ness and superior predictive capability even under challenging conditions. F Prompt Design for ChatGPT We use the GPT-4o model of OpenAI public API (version up to May 13, 2024) and design a prompt elaborately to test the performance on the MECTEC task. The prompt (i.e., the input of Chat- GPT) includes three parts: \u2022 Instruction. We use instructions to guide the ChatGPT on what it needs to do. Our instruc- tion is as follows: You are an expert in sentiment analysis and identification of emotional causes. I will give you a conversation between two or more speakers. You need to extract the utter-cause- emotion triplet of the given utterance. Meanwhile, we provide a detailed description of the output formats required for ChatGPT, as illustrated in Table 8. \u2022 Demonstrations We achieve the few-shot in-context learning of ChatGPT by adding demonstrations. We use the 5-shot in-context learning due to the limitations of the input length. Each demonstration includes a conver- sation as input and a target utterance as the target for prediction. Except for the aforementioned two parts, we also need to describe the conversations to be predicted and the corresponding target utterance. An exam- ple is shown in Table 8."

    "Beyond Quality: Unlocking Diversity in Ad Headline Generation with Large Language Models Chang Wang1*, Siyu Yan1,2*\u2020, Depeng Yuan1, Yuqi Chen1, Yanhua Huang1\u2021, Yuanhang Zheng1, Shuhao Li1, Yinqi Zhang 1, Kedi Chen1,2\u2020, Mingrui Zhu1, Ruiwen Xu1 1Xiaohongshu Inc., 2East China Normal University {wangchang2,yanhuahuang}@xiaohongshu.com, yansiyu@stu.ecnu.edu.cn Abstract The generation of ad headlines plays a vital role in modern advertising, where both quality and diversity are essential to engage a broad range of audience segments. Current approaches primarily optimize language models for head- line quality or click-through rates (CTR), often overlooking the need for diversity and result- ing in homogeneous outputs. To address this limitation, we propose DIVER, a novel frame- work based on large language models (LLMs) that are jointly optimized for both diversity and quality. We first design a semantic- and stylistic-aware data generation pipeline that automatically produces high-quality training pairs with ad content and multiple diverse head- lines. To achieve the goal of generating high- quality and diversified ad headlines within a single forward pass, we propose a multi-stage multi-objective optimization framework with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforce- ment learning (RL). Experiments on real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that DIVER ef- fectively balances quality and diversity. De- ployed on a large-scale content-sharing plat- form serving hundreds of millions of users, our framework improves advertiser value (ADVV) and CTR by 4.0% and 1.4%. 1 Introduction Ad headline generation plays an essential role in modern advertising, where the ability to produce diverse and engaging headlines directly influences campaign effectiveness (Ao et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2022). As shown in Figure 1, achieving this requires models that can flexibly adapt to different focal points, tones, and stylistic nuances.

In ad headline generation, this re- quires diverse, high-quality headlines per content instance, the creation of which is labor-intensive. To address these challenges, we propose DIVER, a novel optimizing framework that reformulates di- versified ad headline generation as a multi-stage, multi-objective optimization task. This framework enables the model to generate multiple diverse yet high-quality headlines in a single forward pass. To achieve this goal, we first introduce a semantic and stylistic-aware data generation pipeline that auto- matically produces high-quality and diverse paired datasets. We then perform cold-start SFT on the synthetic data to equip the model with basic capa- bilities for generating multiple candidate headlines. Finally, we design a multi-objective reward func- tion and apply reinforcement learning to optimize for quality and diversity explicitly. Our main contributions are as follows: \u2022 We propose DIVER, a novel multi-stage multi- objective optimization framework that gener- ates diverse, high-quality ad headlines. \u2022 We develop an automatic data generation pipeline that produces diverse, semantically and stylistically rich training examples. \u2022 We adopt a multi-stage training strategy with cold-start SFT and multi-objective RL to bal- ance diversity and quality. \u2022 We deploy DIVER on the Explore Feed of Xiaohongshu (a.k.a RedNote)1, a large-scale content-sharing platform, improving users\u2019 en- gagement and advertisers\u2019 satisfaction. 2 Related Work 2.1 Ad Headline Generation Ad headline generation is a longstanding core task in natural language generation (NLG) (Tevet and Berant, 2021). Early methods relied on handcrafted templates, rule-based heuristics, or retrieval ap- proaches (Bartz et al., 2008; Fujita et al., 2010; Thomaidou et al., 2013), which produced generic and inflexible outputs. The emergence of neu- ral models, particularly sequence-to-sequence and 1https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore. Transformer-based architectures (Xu et al., 2019; Kanungo et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2025), has sub- stantially improved headline fluency and contex- tuality. Despite these advances, most methods re- main centered on optimizing headline quality and CTR, neglecting the importance of diversity in out- puts. To address the limitations of conventional approaches, recent research has explored person- alization (Ao et al., 2023; Song et al., 2023; Tan et al., 2024) by incorporating user preferences or contextual signals to tailor outputs to individual users. However, these personalized methods often focus on specific audiences without systematically improving headline diversity. Furthermore, the ab- sence of multi-reference datasets continues to hin- der the creation of varied ad content. To address these limitations, we propose a multi-stage, multi- objective framework with automatic data genera- tion to systematically enhance headline diversity. 2.2 LLMs for Diversity Recent advances in LLMs (Naveed et al., 2023; Achiam et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024) have signifi- cantly enhanced automatic text generation across a wide range of",
    "limitations, we propose a multi-stage, multi- objective framework with automatic data genera- tion to systematically enhance headline diversity. 2.2 LLMs for Diversity Recent advances in LLMs (Naveed et al., 2023; Achiam et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024) have signifi- cantly enhanced automatic text generation across a wide range of tasks, from headline generation (Lian et al., 2025) to more open-ended creative writing and content creation (Mai and Carson-Berndsen, 2024). To encourage diversity in generated texts, researchers have explored various stochastic de- coding strategies (Holtzman et al., 2020; Fan et al., 2018) as well as prompt engineering tech- niques (Lau et al., 2024). However, while stochas- tic decoding can increase diversity, it often leads to uncontrollable outputs with compromised text quality and coherence. On the other hand, prompt engineering typically depends on pre-defined la- bels or templates, which inherently limit the flexi- bility and generalization of the models to new do- mains or tasks. More recently, researchers have begun investigating diversity-driven training ob- jectives (Mai and Carson-Berndsen, 2024) to ex- plicitly promote diversity during training, but the trade-off between quality and diversity remains un- derexplored. Although methods such as SFT and RL on task-specific datasets can improve headline quality (Mai and Carson-Berndsen, 2024), they of- ten produce deterministic outputs by overfitting to dominant patterns (Kirk et al., 2024), limiting diver- sity. To address these issues, our solution combines synthetic data and multi-objective RL to jointly optimize diversity, quality, and CTR, generating high-quality headlines in a single pass. 2 Stylistic Types Semantic Keywords Ding ding\u2728 Here are my early autumn sweatshirt outfit ideas ( \u0300\u2304 \u0301) The [Brand] Meow-Meow sweatshirt totally gets what girls want!! \ud83d\udc08 Today\u2019s look is also paired with their new sneakers, [Brand]'s Sweet Bun Shoes Semantic Keyword: Autumn Sweatshirts Stylistic Type: Direct, Emoji, Statement [Label]: {\u201ctitle\u201d: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d} [Instruction]: You are a headline generation expert \u2026 Given the <note content>, <semantic keyword>, and <stylistic type>, please generate a suitable title for the note.

Our approach first performs synthetic data-augmented SFT to enable basic diversity in headline generation. This is followed by multi-objective RL to further enhance the diversity and quality of generated headlines through a composite reward function. 3 Method We introduce DIVER for generating diverse ad headlines, as illustrated in Figure 2. DIVER employs a multi-stage multi-objective training pipeline consisting of (1) synthetic data-augmented fine-tuning for cold-start SFT (Section 3.1), and (2) multi-objective reinforcement learning for enhanc- ing quality and diversity (Section 3.2). 3.1 Synthetic Data for Cold-start SFT Creating datasets with multiple diverse headlines for each ad content is labor-intensive. To address this, we propose a data generation pipeline that leverages LLMs to synthesize training samples for cold-start supervised fine-tuning. Semantic- and Stylistic-aware Data Enrichment. Given an industrial dataset D consisting of origi- nal headlines and their corresponding ad content, we first employ open source LLMs to annotate each headline with its semantic keyword and stylis- tic type2, resulting in a dataset D\u2032 composed of quadruples in the format \u27e8ad content, semantic key- word, stylistic type, headline\u27e9. We then fine-tune a generator \u03c0\u03b8gen with \u27e8ad content, semantic keyword, stylistic type\u27e9as input and headline as the target label, enabling it to generate headlines conditioned on both semantic and stylistic cues. 2Throughout the paper, we define an ad headline style along three dimensions: directness (direct vs. indirect), emoji usage (with emoji vs. without emoji), and rhetorical type (question, exaggeration, metaphor, or statement). Combining these dimensions yields a total of 16 distinct headline styles. Controlled Diverse Headline Generation. For each ad content, we prompt an LLM to gener- ate multiple semantically distinct keywords con- ditioned on the ad content, each paired with a ran- domly selected stylistic type. These semantic key- words and style pairs, combined with the ad con- tent, are fed into \u03c0\u03b8gen to produce diverse headline sets in both meaning and tone. Finally, we further perform an LLM-based verification step to ensure that each generated headline covers the required se- mantic keywords and matches the assigned stylistic type. Only headlines that pass this verification are retained for subsequent training. Dataset Construction and Training.

    "headline covers the required se- mantic keywords and matches the assigned stylistic type. Only headlines that pass this verification are retained for subsequent training. Dataset Construction and Training. The syn- thetic dataset consists of ad content as input and a set of multiple headlines as output, structured in a consistent template format, as illustrated in Figure 2. During cold-start SFT, we input ad con- tent into \u03c0\u03b8sft and train it to generate multiple di- verse headlines in a structured format, allowing the model to produce semantically and stylistically varied outputs in a single pass. 3.2 Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning While SFT with synthetic data can encourage ba- sic diversity, supervised learning alone often leads to repetitive outputs and mediocre phrasing (Kirk et al., 2024). To overcome this, we adopt multi- objective reinforcement learning with a tailored reward function, a widely used approach for balanc- ing and optimizing multiple competing objectives in RLHF (Wu et al., 2023; Dai et al., 2024). 3 rf | iim ec \u00ab S S 3.2.1 Reward Design We design fine-grained reward functions to guide the model in generating diverse, faithful, and en- gaging headlines, with the overall reward averaged across five components. Further details on the re- ward function design and reward model training are provided in Appendix A. Diversity Reward. This reward combines seman- tic and stylistic diversity. Semantic diversity is mea- sured as the complement of the average pairwise BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002), while stylistic diversity reflects the coverage of predefined style types. The overall reward is computed as: rdiversity = 1 \u2212Pair-BLEU(Y ) + Coverage(Y ) 2 , where Y = {y1, . . . , yN} is the set of generated headlines. Quality Reward. We evaluate the quality of each headline in terms of faithfulness to the input docu- ment, using a fine-tuned model that outputs a faith- fulness score between 0 and 1. The reward reflects the proportion of headlines that meet or exceed a given faithfulness threshold. CTR Reward. To reflect user satisfaction, we use a CTR prediction model trained on historical user interaction logs to score each generated head- line. The user preference reward is the average CTR score across all generated headlines. Quantity Reward. This reward encourages the model to output the predefined number of head- lines by explicitly comparing the actual count with the specified target number. The reward grows lin- early with the number of generated headlines and saturates when the target number is reached. Format Reward. This reward is higher if the model is able to generate the headlines in a correct and easily parsed JSON format, making it straight- forward and efficient to extract each headline. 3.2.2 RL Optimization We formulate headline generation",
    "generated headlines and saturates when the target number is reached. Format Reward. This reward is higher if the model is able to generate the headlines in a correct and easily parsed JSON format, making it straight- forward and efficient to extract each headline. 3.2.2 RL Optimization We formulate headline generation as a policy learn- ing task, where the model \u03c0\u03b8 generates N head- lines per content x in a single pass, producing out- puts Y = {y1, . . . , yN}. During RL optimization, we repeatedly sample headline sets, compute the composite reward, and update the model using the GRPO algorithm (Shao et al., 2024): max \u03b8 Ex\u223cD, Y \u223c\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7|x) [R(x, Y )]\u2212\u03b2DKL (\u03c0\u03b8\u2225\u03c0\u03b8sft) , where R(x, Y ) denotes the composite reward for the generated set Y , \u03b2 controls the strength of the KL penalty, and \u03c0\u03b8sft is the reference model. During inference, each input advertising content is passed through \u03c0\u03b8 to generate a set of headlines for online serving. 4 Experiments 4.1 Experimental Setup Datasets. To our knowledge, no publicly avail- able large-scale dataset exists specifically for the advertising domain. Therefore, we constructed an industrial dataset by collecting commercial ad logs from a leading content-sharing platform for both training and evaluation. Further details regarding dataset statistics, construction, and preprocessing can be found in Appendix B. Baselines. We chose Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct as a base model (Qwen, 2025) to conduct SFT and RL training and generate multiple ad headlines. Additional experimental settings are provided in Appendix C. To comprehensively evaluate our ap- proach, we compared it against two categories of baselines. First, we include state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models, such as GPT- 4o (OpenAI, 2024), Claude-3.5-Sonnet (Anthropic, 2024), DeepSeek-V3 (DeepSeek-AI, 2025), and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (Qwen, 2025). Second, we consider fine-tuning-based methods, including Pos- sibility Exploration Fine-Tuning (PEFT) (Mai and Carson-Berndsen, 2024), applied to our gener- ated dataset. All models were tested on the same datasets under controlled settings. Evaluation Metrics. We adopt a dual-aspect evaluation framework that considers both diversity and quality. To assess diversity, we measure both lexical and semantic variation among generated ti- tles using Pairwise BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), Self-BLEU (Zhu et al., 2018), Distinct N-Gram (Li et al., 2015), and Cosine Similarity (Salton and McGill, 1986)3.

Subscripts show differences compared with DIVER, with red indicating worse and green indicating better performance. 4.2 Main Results As shown in Table 1, DIVER demonstrates supe- rior performance over other methods across most diversity metrics. Specifically, it achieves the low- est scores for both Pairwise-BLEU and Self-BLEU, indicating minimal redundancy among generated titles, and covers the largest proportion of target styles. Meanwhile, our approach maintains a high quality score that is on par with advanced base- lines such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet and DeepSeek V3. Compared to prompting and fine-tuning strategies, DIVER consistently produces ad headlines that are more diverse and stylistically rich while remaining faithful to the original content. These findings un- derscore the capability of our approach to produce ad headlines that balance diversity and quality. 4.3 Ablation Studies To evaluate the contribution of each component in our framework, we perform ablation studies by selectively removing the semantic- and stylistic- aware data augmentation pipeline (w/o Data), the multi-objective reinforcement learning phase (w/o RL), or both (w/o Both). As shown in Table 2,",

As shown in Table 2, removing either the augmented data or the RL stage leads to noticeable declines in both diversity and faithfulness. Excluding both components leads to the weakest performance, while DIVER achieves the best balance of diversity and quality, with the highest quality score, broadest style coverage, and lowest redundancy, highlighting the value of data augmentation and RL optimization. 4.4 Analysis of Multi-objective RL We further analyze the effectiveness of each reward function within the multi-objective RL. As shown in Table 2, removing the diversity reward (w/o Di- versity) leads to a significant decrease in all diver- sity metrics, while minimal improvement in head- line quality, indicating its key role in promoting output variety.

Quality) improves diversity but sharply reduces faithfulness and informativeness, highlighting the quality signal\u2019s importance. Removing CTR, quan- tity, or format rewards leads to declines in style coverage, diversity, or overall performance, indi- cating that all components are vital for balancing diversity and quality. 4.5 Online Case Study Table 3 shows diverse ad headlines generated by DIVER. For each advertisement, the model gener- ates multiple candidate titles that cover different expressions or emphases, reflecting varied user per- spectives (e.g., male or female) and interests (e.g., functional vs. aesthetic appeal, practical tips vs. emotional resonance). This demonstrates its ability to produce a wide range of high-quality and diverse ad headlines for online personalization. 4.6 Online A/B Test We have deployed DIVER on the Explore Feed of Xiaohongshu, a large-scale content sharing plat- form, where advertising performance is primarily measured by advertiser value (ADVV) (Chai et al., 2025; Timmaraju et al., 2023) and click-through rate (CTR). During online serving, we first generate 30 ad headlines with DIVER. To enable personal- ization, we select the headline most semantically similar to the user profile. Online A/B testing re- sults, as shown in Table 4, demonstrate the practi- cal effectiveness of DIVER. Specifically, models using high-temperature sampling and SFT with- out synthetic data achieve moderate improvements over the base model in both ADVV (+2.2%) and CTR (+0.7%). DIVER, combining synthetic data, cold-start SFT, and multi-objective RL, achieves a further boost, with ADVV increasing by 4.0% and CTR by 1.4%. These results show that our ap- proach enhances both headline quality and diversity while delivering business impact. 5 Conclusion This paper addresses the challenge of generating ad headlines that are both high-quality and diverse, which is crucial for attracting and engaging var- ious user segments. By introducing a semantic- and stylistic-aware data generation pipeline and a multi-stage, multi-objective optimization frame- work combining SFT and RL, our method effec- tively balances diversity and quality. We have suc- cessfully deployed DIVER on a large-scale content- sharing platform, achieving significant gains in core metrics for the advertising system. 6 Limitations Although DIVER performs well in generating di- verse, high-quality ad headlines, several limitations remain. Synthetic data may introduce noise or stylistic bias, limiting personalization and gener- alization. Diversity in long-tail categories suffers from data scarcity, and fixed reward metrics may overlook nuanced user preferences.",

Synthetic data may introduce noise or stylistic bias, limiting personalization and gener- alization. Diversity in long-tail categories suffers from data scarcity, and fixed reward metrics may overlook nuanced user preferences. Deployment also faces challenges in latency, scalability, and adapting to user trends. Future work will focus on enriching long-tail data, incorporating richer signals, and adopting more adaptive rewards to im- prove practical effectiveness. Ethical Considerations All datasets used in this study used are properly licensed and contain no private or sensitive user information. Generated ad headlines require adver- tiser approval before use, and we apply rigorous post-processing, including quality control and risk assessment, prior to online deployment. An online blacklist system further ensures rapid removal of any problematic content. These measures collec- tively safeguard user privacy, content integrity, and platform safety throughout our framework.

Details about Rule-based Rewards. We formu- late diversity, quantity, and format rewards as rule- based rewards. For the diversity reward, seman- tic diversity is computed as the average pairwise BLEU score within the generated set, i.e, Pair-BLEU(Y ) = 1 Z N X i=1 N X j=1 i\u0338=j BLEU(yi, yj) , where Z = N \u00b7 (N \u22121). Style diversity is measured by the proportion of distinct style cat- egories presents in the generated headlines, where we prompt DeepSeek-V3 to classify the style of the headline. The quantity reward encourages gen- erating at least T headlines, defined as rquantity = min(1, N/T). The format reward is 1 if the output is valid JSON; otherwise, it is 0. Details about Quality Reward. To promote high-quality headline generation, we use a human- labeled quality reward. Headlines sampled via high-temperature SFT are labeled as high-quality (1) or not (0) and used to train a binary classifier fquality(\u00b7) with content and headline as input, op- timized using binary cross-entropy. The quality reward during RL is the average predicted score across all headline-content pairs. Details about CTR Reward. To optimize user satisfaction, we train a CTR-based reward model using online interaction logs. For each 10,000 notes, multiple headlines are generated via high- temperature SFT, and user interaction data is used to label the top and bottom third of headlines by CTR as positive and negative samples. This yields 40,000 headline pairs to train a CTR",
    "CTR-based reward model using online interaction logs. For each 10,000 notes, multiple headlines are generated via high- temperature SFT, and user interaction data is used to label the top and bottom third of headlines by CTR as positive and negative samples. This yields 40,000 headline pairs to train a CTR prediction model fCTR(h, x) with headline h and content x as input and optimize with a pairwise margin loss: L = 1 N N X i=1 max(0, 0.3 \u2212s+ i + s\u2212 i ) , where N represents the batch size, s+ i = fCTR(h+ i , xi) and h+ i is the positive headline for the content xi. s\u2212 i = fCTR(h\u2212 i , xi) represents the predicted score for the negative headline. All user data is anonymized. During RL training, the CTR reward is the average predicted score across all generated headline and content pairs. B Dataset Construction and Processing This section introduces the dataset used for our ad headline generation task. Raw Data. Our dataset comprises commercial ad notes from a major content-sharing platform in China. To ensure privacy and compliance, all per- sonal information was anonymized. Each instance includes the original title, content, topics, caption, and taxonomy, offering key semantic and stylistic cues for headline generation. Preprocessing. To ensure data quality and repre- sentativeness, we prioritized titles with high CTR while filtering out those with inflated CTR due to excessive exposure. We also balanced category dis- tribution, removed duplicate or near-duplicate ads based on string similarity, and cleaned records with missing fields, repetition, or encoding errors. Split and Statistics. The dataset was chronologi- cally split into training and test sets to reflect real- world usage. Table 5 presents key statistics.

Built on top of generative AI capabilities, Agentic AI represents a major shift toward autonomous, goal-driven systems that can reason, retrieve, and act. However, they also inherit the bias present in both internal and external information sources. This significantly affects the fairness and balance of retrieved information, and hence reduces user trust. To address this critical challenge, we introduce a novel Bias Mitigation Agent, a multi-agent system designed to orchestrate the workflow of bias mitigation through specialized agents that optimize the selection of sources to ensure that the retrieved content is both highly relevant and minimally biased to promote fair and balanced knowledge dissemination. The experi- mental results demonstrate an 81.82% reduction in bias compared to a baseline naive retrieval strategy.

ACM ISBN 978-1-4503-XXXX-X/2018/06 https://doi.org/10.1145/XXXXXXX.XXXXXXX a variety of prompting techniques have emerged, shaping the way users interact with LLMs. The zero-shot prompting allows LLMs to generate responses without explicit examples provided within the prompt. Kojima et al. [12] demonstrated that LLMs are not only capable of generating effective responses, but also show intrinsic reasoning abilities when prompted using the zero shot technique. Similarly, Few-Shot prompting involves offering the model a small, explicitly defined set of examples within the prompt, guiding the model\u2019s understanding, and improving output accuracy and rea- soning capabilities [3]. To further enhance the capabilities of LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as an effec- tive extension to traditional prompting techniques. RAG combines retrieval systems with generative language models, enabling the models to access external knowledge sources dynamically during response generation [13]. This technological leap serves as the bedrock for rapidly emerg- ing field of agentic AI, representing a significant paradigm shift towards autonomous systems. Unlike earlier AI applications, these agents are designed not just to respond or generate, but to rea- son, plan, retrieve information, utilize tools, and execute complex, multi-step tasks to achieve specific goals autonomously. However, as agentic AI systems increasingly rely on LLMs and external infor- mation sources to inform their reasoning and actions, they inherit and often amplify their critical vulnerability: bias [1]. Bias refers to the consistent imbalance and unjust representation that arises from responses derived from sources that disproportionately privilege or disadvantage specific groups, often mirroring historical or societal inequalities. LLMs are known to capture and reflect the societal biases present in their vast training dataset leading to output that can perpetuate stereotypes related to gender, race, ethnicity, politi- cal leaning, and other characteristics [6]. Furthermore, the external knowledge that the agents utilize is itself not neutral. News articles, and other online documents frequently contain skewed perspec- tives, misinformation, or systemic biases [15]. This propagation of bias directly undermines user trust, compromises system reliability, and poses significant risks of generating harmful or inequitable outcomes [7]. While various techniques exist for mitigating bias within the LLMs themselves such as Zhang et al. [26] presents a model-level debiasing technique using preference optimization algorithm and a debiased preference dataset to address modality bias, where the model over-relies on one modality. These methods often fall short in the dynamic context of Agentic AI workflows. Now a days, the challenge is to actively managing the bias ingested from constantly changing external sources during task execution. Existing agent frameworks often prioritize task completion and information rele- vance, latency over robust and integrated mechanisms to evaluate arXiv:2508.18724v1 [cs.AI] 26 Aug 2025 KDD\u201925, August 03-07, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada Karanbir Singh, Deepak Muppiri, and William",

This gap highlights a critical need for novel approaches that address bias directly at the point of information retrieval within agentic architectures. To address this gap, we introduce the Bias Mitigation Agent, a novel multi-agent framework specifically designed to operate within Agentic AI workflows. Our approach automates the bias mit- igation process by optimizing the selection of potential information sources prior to ingestion. We propose two techniques for source selection: a zero-shot approach and a few-shot approach, both designed to dynamically assess and mitigate bias during agent oper- ation, thus enhancing fairness, reliability, and overall system trust- worthiness. Our results show that this bias reduction is achieved without a corresponding loss in information relevance, showcasing the potential of our approach to promote the development of more responsible, trustworthy, and equitable Agentic AI systems. The rest of the paper details the related work and architecture of the Bias Mitigation Agent. Also, we present results of comprehen- sive experiments designed to validate its effectiveness, demonstrat- ing significant quantitative improvements in retrieving unbiased documents across various scenarios compared to baseline agentic retrieval. 2 Related Work In this section, we discuss the existing work that was done to identify and mitigate bias from AI driven systems. These tech- niques can be categorized based on the stage of the AI lifecycle at which they are implemented: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. In addition to these traditional categories, we also include prompt and agentic bias mitigation approaches to capture emerging work that leverages prompt engineering and autonomous agents to address bias. 2.1 Pre-processing techniques Pre-processing techniques aim to mitigate biases within datasets before they are used for training models, thereby reducing the risk of perpetuating systemic unfairness and thus inherently produc- ing fair models. Kamiran and Calders [10] proposed three data preprocessing techniques: Massaging, Reweighting, and Sampling to address discrimination and mitigate bias in classification tasks. De-Arteaga et al. [5]removed gender-related words from a set of bi- ographies which resulted in significant improvement in the fairness of a classifier used to predict corresponding occupations. Raza et al. [16] introduced Dbias, an open-source Python package designed to detect and mitigate biases in news articles. Dbias pipeline is made up of three core modules: bias detection, bias recognition, and de-biasing. The pipeline ensures that pre-processed data is free of bias, resulting in fairer models during training. 2.2 In-processing techniques While pre-processing techniques focus on",
    "Python package designed to detect and mitigate biases in news articles. Dbias pipeline is made up of three core modules: bias detection, bias recognition, and de-biasing. The pipeline ensures that pre-processed data is free of bias, resulting in fairer models during training. 2.2 In-processing techniques While pre-processing techniques focus on data preparation, in- processing approaches tackle bias directly during model training or inference. The idea is to penalize the model if it favors bias and hence it controls the loss function to minimize bias. For example, Rekabsaz et al. [17] develop AdvBert, a BERT based ranking model that uses adversarial training to simultaneously predict relevance and suppress protected attributes in content retrieved by IR sys- tems. Jaenich et al. [9] modify the ranking process using policies to ensure that different document categories are ranked fairly and hence improving fairness metrics by 13% in IR systems. Singh and Joachims [18] propose a generic fairness-aware learning-to-rank (LTR) framework using a policy-gradient method to enforce fair- ness constraints within a listwise LTR setting. Building on this, Zehlike and Castillo [25] integrate fairness into listwise LTR by in- corporating a regularization term into the model\u2019s utility objective. 2.3 Post processing techniques Post processing introduces fairness after the model or ranking output is generated. Yang and Stoyanovich [23] proposed fairness measures for ranked outputs and incorporated these measures into an optimization framework to improve fairness while maintaining accuracy. Zehlike et al. [24] introduced FA*IR, a post-processing algorithm to ensure group fairness in the retrieved documents by guaranteeing a minimum proportion of protected candidates while maximizing utility in IR systems. 2.4 Prompting techniques The way users interact with LLMs, and the instructions given to the model, can significantly influence bias expression. Prompt engi- neering techniques aim to guide the model towards fairer outputs by providing specific instructions (e.g., \"avoid stereotypes,\" \"provide balanced views\"), setting context, or using role-playing prompts. Ma et al. [14] proposed a novel search strategy based on greedy search to identify the near-optimal prompt to improve the performance of LLM\u2019s. Kamruzzaman and Kim [11] explores prompting techniques inspired by dual process theory to reduce social biases in LLM\u2019s, techniques such as human and machine like personals, explicit debiasing instructions and chain of though prompting are used to influence the model output to reduce stereotypical responses. 2.5 Agentic mitigation techniques The autonomy and interactive nature of Agentic AI require specific mitigation approaches.

    "reliance on external informa- tion, strategies focusing on bias-aware information retrieval and source selection are crucial. This can involve integrating bias de- tectors as tools within the agent\u2019s framework to evaluate potential sources before using the information [19]. Borah and Mihalcea [2] proposes a multi-agent approach, where a metric is developed to assess the presence of bias and then self-reflection and supervised fine-tuning strategies are employed to mitigate bias. Xu et al. [22] tackles bias mitigation using a multi-objective approach within a multi-agent framework(MOMA) to mitigate bias. Multiple agents are deployed and perform interventions on the bias-related contents of the query. The approach we present uses agentic mitigation techniques, where multiple agents, such as knowledge, bias detector, source selector, and writer, interact and perform specific tasks to miti- gate bias in the output provided to the user without degrading performance. Bias Mitigation Agent: Optimizing Source Selection for Fair and Balanced Knowledge Retrieval KDD\u201925, August 03-07, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada Figure 1: Architecture of a Supervisor-Based Multi-Agent System for Bias Mitigation. The diagram depicts the life cycle of the agent from user\u2019s query to final answer coordinated by the manager agent. The Knowledge Agent retrieves documents, the Bias Detection Agent evaluates retrieved documents for bias, and the Source Selector Agent chooses the optimal unbiased sources. Finally, the Writer Agent synthesizes a coherent, unbiased answer, which is presented back to the user. 3 Approach This section outlines the architecture and operational design of the Bias Mitigation Framework, a multi-agent system constructed using LangGraph [8] which supports stateful workflows to manage inter- agent communication and control flow. The framework is designed to enhance fairness and transparency in knowledge-retrieval tasks by orchestrating a set of specialized agents through a centralized control mechanism. At its core, the system consists of a Manager Agent (\ud835\udc40), a set of Worker Agents (\ud835\udc4a), and a shared state of the system (S). Each worker agent \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc4ais responsible for a specific task such as doc- ument retrieval, bias detection, source selection, etc. The Manager Agent supervises the execution flow, maintains system state, and coordinates decisions based on intermediate outcomes. The framework supports three operational modes, enabling dif- ferent strategies for source selection: \u2022 No Source Selection: In this baseline mode, the system retrieves the most relevant document on the basis of vector similarity to the user query. The document is then passed to the writer agent without performing any source selection. \u2022 Zero-Shot: In this mode, the system retrieves multiple can- didate documents and evaluates them based on relevance and bias. The source selector agent makes a decision based solely on these metrics using its parametric knowledge and reasoning capability. This mode provides a lightweight fair- ness mechanism without requiring",
    "selection. \u2022 Zero-Shot: In this mode, the system retrieves multiple can- didate documents and evaluates them based on relevance and bias. The source selector agent makes a decision based solely on these metrics using its parametric knowledge and reasoning capability. This mode provides a lightweight fair- ness mechanism without requiring any kind of in-context learning. \u2022 Few-Shot: This advanced mode leverages labeled examples to guide the source selector agent in making informed de- cisions. It combines bias and relevance scores with prior demonstrations to achieve more consistent and nuanced se- lections, especially in domains with subjective or ambiguous content. By supporting these three modes, the framework enables flexible trade-offs between computational efficiency, fairness enforcement, and generalization capability. In the next subsections, the internal state, behavior of the Manager Agent, and the specialized functions of the Worker Agents are defined. 3.1 State The framework maintains an internal state to facilitate structured decision-making between agents. This state captures the evolving system context, supports transitions, enforces retry logic, and im- plements guardrails to ensure that the final user response is both relevant and fair. We define the state S as a tuple, as presented in Equation 1: S = (C, \ud835\udefc,\ud835\udf05, \ud835\udf07, \ud835\udf1a) (1) KDD\u201925, August 03-07, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada Karanbir Singh, Deepak Muppiri, and William Ngu where: \u2022 C = {\ud835\udc501,\ud835\udc502, . . . ,\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b} \u2286D is the set of candidate documents retrieved from the vector store, where D represents the complete corpus of documents. \u2022 \ud835\udefc\u2208C denotes the document selected for final answer gen- eration. \u2022 \ud835\udf05\u2208N is the current retry attempt. \u2022 \ud835\udf07\u2208N specifies the maximum number of retries allowed. \u2022 \ud835\udf1a\u2208S captures the most recent rejection reason (e.g., all candidates rejected due to bias or low relevance). Each document \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\u2208D is further modeled as a tuple, as defined in Equation 2: \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56= (\ud835\udf12, \ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udefd,\ud835\udefe) (2) where: \u2022 \ud835\udf12is the textual content of the document. \u2022 \ud835\udf0c\u2208[0, 1] is the relevance score with respect to the user query. \u2022 \ud835\udefd\u2208[0, 1] is the bias confidence score, which represents the system\u2019s confidence in its bias assessment. \u2022 \ud835\udefe\u2208{0, 1} is a binary label that indicates whether the docu- ment is biased (\ud835\udefe= 1) or unbiased (\ud835\udefe= 0). This formalism enables the framework to track a comprehensive and interpretable state across multiple agent interactions and adapt the retrieval process in response to fairness constraints. 3.2 Manager Agent <System Prompt with source selection> You are a Supervisor Agent responsible for coordinating multiple specialized agents in a multi-agent system.

Figure 2: System prompt used for manager when source se- lection is enabled. The manager agent is the coordinator within the Bias Mitigation Framework. It is responsible for maintaining the current state of the system, directing the sequence of agent invocations, and enforcing retry policies in the event of retrieval/selection failures. The agent is guided by system-level prompts, which vary depending on the execution mode. These prompts are illustrated in Figures 2 and 3. <System Prompt without source selection> You are a Supervisor Agent responsible for coordinating multiple specialized agents in a multi-agent system.

Figure 3: System prompt used for manager when source se- lection is disabled. 3.3 Worker Agents The Worker Agents are specialized components of the Bias Miti- gation Framework. Unlike the Manager Agent, which controls the orchestration and high-level control flow, these agents focus on specific tasks. The framework consists of the following worker agents: 3.3.1 Knowledge Agent. This agent is implemented as a tool-calling agent that interfaces with ChromaDB [4], which acts as a retriever. Its primary responsibility is to fetch the top-\ud835\udc58documents from the corpus based on vector similarity to the user query \ud835\udc5e. The agent operates differently depending on whether source selection is enabled. In case of no source selection mode, the agent retrieves a single document \ud835\udc51\u2208D that maximizes relevance and is automatically chosen as the selected source \ud835\udefcwithout using any sophisticated process to mitigate bias, reflecting the typical behavior of the cur- rent LLM-based information retrieval systems in production as presented in the following equation 3: \ud835\udefc= \ud835\udc51= arg max \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\u2208D \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc56 (3) Here, \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc56denotes the relevance score of the document \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56. When source selection is enabled, the agent retrieves a set of",
    "mitigate bias, reflecting the typical behavior of the cur- rent LLM-based information retrieval systems in production as presented in the following equation 3: \ud835\udefc= \ud835\udc51= arg max \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\u2208D \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc56 (3) Here, \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc56denotes the relevance score of the document \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56. When source selection is enabled, the agent retrieves a set of candidate documents C \u2286D to allow downstream agents to assess both relevance and bias. If all candidate documents \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\u2208C are rejected due to high bias or low relevance, then the system retries to retrieve ideal candidates C. In the retry phase, the agent per- forms query expansion, transforming the original query \ud835\udc5einto an improved query \ud835\udc5e\u2032 based on the rejection reason \ud835\udf1a. The new query \ud835\udc5e\u2032 is embedded as \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc5e\u2032, and a new set of candidate documents is se- lected. The resulting set of candidates is passed on to downstream agents for further evaluation. 3.3.2 Bias Detection Agent. This Agent is responsible for evalu- ating the presence and severity of bias at the source level. When source selection is enabled, the manager forwards the candidate set C retrieved by the knowledge agent to the agent. Each candidate Bias Mitigation Agent: Optimizing Source Selection for Fair and Balanced Knowledge Retrieval KDD\u201925, August 03-07, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada document \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\u2208C is then analyzed using a pre-trained text classifi- cation model called Dbias [16]. For each candidate document, the agent assigns the following: \u2022 A bias confidence score (\ud835\udefd\ud835\udc56\u2208[0, 1]), which quantifies the system confidence in the detected bias. \u2022 A binary label (\ud835\udefe\ud835\udc56\u2208{0, 1}), where \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc56= 1 indicates that the document is biased, and \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc56= 0 indicates that it is unbiased. These values are then used to update the current state S. In the case of no source selection mode, the agent operates on the selected document \ud835\udefc, applying the same analysis pipeline. This ensures that even in the absence of comparative selection, the system retains awareness of potential bias in the final chosen source. 3.3.3 Source Selection Agent. The agent is responsible for iden- tifying the most suitable document from the candidate set C by evaluating both the relevance and the bias metrics. This agent is invoked only when the system operates in modes that enable source selection, specifically zero-shot and few-shot. Zero Shot. In this mode, the agent applies a rule-based selection strategy and uses the parametric knowledge and reasoning ability of the underlying model to select a suitable source \ud835\udefcto answer the user\u2019s query \ud835\udc5e. During the first attempt, it adheres to strict selection criteria as defined in equation 4 where only documents with \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc56= 0 (unbiased) and \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc56\u22650.7 (high confidence in the determination) are considered. Among these, the document with the highest relevance score \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc56is selected. \ud835\udefc= arg",
    "\ud835\udefcto answer the user\u2019s query \ud835\udc5e. During the first attempt, it adheres to strict selection criteria as defined in equation 4 where only documents with \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc56= 0 (unbiased) and \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc56\u22650.7 (high confidence in the determination) are considered. Among these, the document with the highest relevance score \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc56is selected. \ud835\udefc= arg max \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\u2208C\u2032 \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc56, where C\u2032 = {\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\u2208C | \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc56= 0 \u2227\ud835\udefd\ud835\udc56\u22650.7} (4) If no candidate meets the selection criteria, the agent updates the current state S with the rejection reason \ud835\udf1aand the entire retrieval and selection process is executed again by the manager agent. If the system reaches its final attempt, the agent applies relaxed selection rules. This allows the system to still generate an answer even under constrained document conditions. Few Shot. In this mode, the agent uses in-context examples to guide its decision making. It is provided with a set of labeled in- stances that illustrate how to select the optimal document based on combinations of (\ud835\udefd\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udefe\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc56) values. These examples encode decision patterns that help the agent generalize the source selection logic beyond simple thresholding mechanisms. Given a set of candidates C, the agent evaluates each candidate \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56based on its similarity to previous examples and selects the most appropriate document that meets the dual criteria of high relevance and minimal bias. Formally: \ud835\udefc= arg max \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\u2208C \ud835\udc53few-shot(\ud835\udefd\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udefe\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc56) (5) where \ud835\udc53few-shot is a learned or example-conditioned scoring func- tion implicitly encoded via prompt demonstrations. Similarly to the zero-shot mode, if no candidate meets the selec- tion criteria, then the system attempts to retry and pick the suitable candidate as the selected source \ud835\udefc. 3.3.4 Writer Agent. The agent is responsible for generating the final response to the user\u2019s query \ud835\udc5e. It takes the selected document User Query \ud835\udc5e Initialize State S Knowledge Agent Bias Detection Agent Source Selection Enabled? Source Selection Agent Writer Agent Final Answer Source Selected? yes no yes no Figure 4: Execution flow of the Bias Mitigation Framework across all operational modes \ud835\udefc, as determined by the system, and synthesizes a coherent and contextually grounded response. It is provided with the original user query \ud835\udc5eand the selected source document \ud835\udefcas part of a structured system prompt. The agent is explicitly instructed to rely only on the content of the provided source for its answer generation. This helps ensure factual accuracy and reduces bias by limiting the response to the selected source. The writer agent marks the final stage of the pipeline. Upon generating a satisfactory response, the manager agent terminates the execution and returns the output to the user. Together, these Worker Agents form a tightly integrated and modular pipeline within the Bias Mitigation Framework. Each agent is designed to fulfill a distinct and",

Together, these Worker Agents form a tightly integrated and modular pipeline within the Bias Mitigation Framework. Each agent is designed to fulfill a distinct and well-scoped responsibility, en- abling separation of concerns and ease of extension. By delegat- ing complex tasks such as retrieval, bias evaluation, source selec- tion, and response generation to specialized agents, the system ensures robustness, adaptability, and transparency across diverse user queries and fairness constraints. Figure 4 elaborates on the end-to-end execution flow, highlighting how these agents interact in different operating modes to ensure reliable and bias minimized answer to the user\u2019s query \ud835\udc5e. 4 Experimentation This section evaluates the performance of the Bias Mitigation Agent in its ability to reduce bias while maintaining relevance to the orig- inal user query. The agent uses annotated news articles sourced from the MBIC [21] and BABE datasets [20] to evaluate its bias detection and mitigation capabilities. We curated 112 queries to validate the bias mitigation capabilities of the agent. To conduct these experiments, we utilized OpenAI\u2019s GPT series models such as GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, and GPT-4.1-mini as the underlying rea- soning engines. The following sections provide a detailed analysis of each approach and present their respective outcomes.

As shown in Table 1 has the fastest response time among the methods, averaging 12.06 seconds per query (\u00b1 2.45) among all models and modes. It achieved a relevance score of 0.181 (\u00b1 0.131) when using GPT-4.1-mini. However, this speed and relevance came at the expense of fairness, with 49.11% of the outputs labeled biased using GPT-4o-mini, 56.25% using GPT- 4.1, and 52.68% using GPT-4.1-mini as shown in Figure 5. The bias classifier\u2019s average confidence score for bias in this mode is 0.8402 (\u00b1 0.1464), 0.858 (\u00b1 0.145), and 0.833 (\u00b1 0.163) using GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, respectively.

GPT-4o-mini performs strongest on bias mitigation over- all, especially under Zero-Shot prompting. 4.2 Zero-Shot In case of GPT-4o-mini, the zero-shot mode achieved the lowest bias rate at 8.929%, significantly outperforming the baseline by approxi- mately 81.82% as presented in Figure 5. The beat average relevance score was 0.366 (\u00b1 0.367), which is even better than the baseline model in terms of utility of the answers to the queries between all models and modes. However, the zero-shot mode incurred the highest latency, averaging 41.38 seconds (\u00b1 13.89) for GPT-4o-mini, 28.66 seconds (\u00b1 13.41) for GPT-4.1, and 35.45 seconds (\u00b1 15.98) for GPT-4.1-mini, as given in Table 1. It also has taken multiple hops in 70.54%, 21.43%, and 26.79% of queries using GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, and GPT-4.1-mini as depicted in Figure 6 respectively. The high retry rate suggests that it adopts a more cautious and itera- tive selection strategy due to the lack of in-context information. Lastly, its average bias confidence was 0.805 (\u00b1 0.1431) using GPT- 4o-mini, 0.841 (\u00b1 0.130) using GPT-4.1, and 0.837 (\u00b1 0.123) using GPT-4.1-mini. 4.3 Few-Shot The few-shot mode utilizes in-context examples to improve se- lection accuracy. Figure 5 shows that in case of GPT-4o-mini, it achieved a bias rate of 14.3%, demonstrating a substantial improve- ment over the baseline mode by 69.48%.

As mentioned in Table 1, the average relevance score of 0.236 (\u00b1 0.251) was achieved, which is higher than the baseline mode for all models. The major improvement came with the average latency which is 37.79 seconds (\u00b1 11.40), 26.93 seconds (\u00b1 11.99), and 30.58 seconds (\u00b1 13.63) using GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini; therefore, it is slightly faster than the zero-shot mode while all the time, as shown in Table 1. Also, Figure 6 shows that it is more decisive as it only retried 29.46%, 18.75%, and 16.07% of the time using GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, and GPT-4.1-mini. In summary, when comparing both models, GPT-4.1-mini consis- tently outperformed GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1 in relevance, achieving the highest average relevance score of 0.366 (\u00b1 0.367) in zero-shot mode which supports its superior ability to generate contextually aligned responses. On the other hand, in terms of bias reduction, GPT-4o-mini with zero-shot mode achieved the lowest bias rate overall at 8.93%, although with increased latency and variability. 5 Conclusion In this paper, we introduce the Bias Mitigation Agent, a novel multi- agent framework designed to enhance fairness and trust in agentic information retrieval systems by optimizing the source selection process.

GPT-4o- mini shows the highest retry activity, especially under Zero- Shot, while GPT-4.1-mini exhibits a more balanced retry pro- file. our system enables dynamic and transparent decision-making for mitigating bias in real time. We evaluated three operational modes, No Source Selection, zero-shot and few-shot across 112 queries using annotated datasets using GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini. The results showed that GPT-4o-mini achieved the lowest overall bias rate (8.93%) in the zero-shot mode, while GPT-4.1-mini consistently outperformed in relevance, with a maximum average relevance score (0.366 \u00b1 0.367) in the zero-shot mode. The modular design of the framework allows for extensibility, making it adaptable for future integrations with more advanced bias detectors, domain-specific retrievers, and additional modalities.

    "EMMM, Explain Me My Model! Explainable Machine Generated Text Detection in Dialogues *Angela Yifei Yuan1, *Haoyi Li1, Soyeon Caren Han1, Christopher Leckie\u20201 1The University of Melbourne {angela.yuan, haoyil4}@student.unimelb.edu.au, {caren.han, caleckie}@unimelb.edu.au Abstract The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in customer service introduces new risks, as malicious actors can exploit them to conduct large-scale user impersonation through machine-generated text (MGT). Current MGT detec- tion methods often struggle in online conversational settings, reducing the reliability and interpretability essential for trust- worthy AI deployment. In customer service scenarios where operators are typically non-expert users, explanation become crucial for trustworthy MGT detection. In this paper, we propose EMMM, an explanation-then-detection framework that balances latency, accuracy, and non-expert-oriented in- terpretability. Experimental results demonstrate that EMMM provides explanations accessible to non-expert users, with 70% of human evaluators preferring its outputs, while achiev- ing competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models and maintaining low latency, generating outputs within 1 sec- ond. Our code and dataset are open-sourced1. 1 Introduction Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized hu- man\u2013AI interaction, enabling highly realistic conversations across a wide range of applications. However, this progress also brings serious security risks: malicious actors can ex- ploit LLMs to impersonate users and launch large-scale at- tacks on online platforms. Such misuse can disrupt critical services such as emergency response and customer support, leading to denial-of-service incidents and operational fail- ures (OWASP 2025). As LLMs continue to proliferate, re- liable and explainable detection of machine-generated text (MGT) in conversational settings has become essential for safeguarding platform reliability and user trust. Existing de- tectors focus on isolated text passages, and they often strug- gle to adapt to the dynamic and interleaved structure of real-world conversations. Moreover, trust in MGT detec- tion systems, especially in online conversational environ- ments, requires explanations that are interpretable to diverse users, including non-experts. In such settings, explanations must be clear and accessible to support understanding of *These authors contributed equally. \u2020Corresponding author 1https://github.com/AngieYYF/EMMM-explainable-chatbot- detection model behavior, review flagged cases, and inform modera- tion decisions. To address this, we propose EMMM, a frame- work specifically designed for real-time MGT detection in conversational settings. By leveraging conversation struc- ture, EMMM achieves high detection accuracy while of- fering multi-level, multi-dimension, and multi-strategy ex- planations tailored for broad user accessibility. We iden- tify three key challenges unique to explainable MGT detec- tion in conversational settings. First, asymmetric detection in dialogues, where interactions are interleaved but detec- tion targets only one party, creates an unusual input struc- ture that limits the model from using full conversational context and necessitates specialized handling. Second, user- friendly explanations for non-experts remain limited, as cur- rent methods frequently use technical metrics such as feature weights (Shah et al. 2023;",
    "but detec- tion targets only one party, creates an unusual input struc- ture that limits the model from using full conversational context and necessitates specialized handling. Second, user- friendly explanations for non-experts remain limited, as cur- rent methods frequently use technical metrics such as feature weights (Shah et al. 2023; Schoenegger, Xia, and Roth 2024) which are inaccessible to service operators without technical backgrounds. Third, local attribution explanations in MGT detection models are difficult to interpret due to the absence of ground-truth, whereas globally aggregated explanations lack the granularity needed for instance-level interpretation. To address these challenges, we propose EMMM, an explanation-driven framework for interpretable LLM chat- bot detection in conversational settings. EMMM integrates (1) Multi-dimensional inputs (behaviors and language), op- erates at (2) Multi-level interaction (turn and dialogue), and employs (3) Multi-strategy explanation (local natu- ral language explanations, and semi-global visual insights). Guided by speech act theory (Austin 1975), EMMM ex- plicitly incorporates dialogue acts into its design. It pro- cesses each incoming user utterance through turn-level and dialogue-level detection modules, selectively aggregating important features across turns. The system generates an ex- planation report that combines highlighted features, natural language reasoning, and semi-global visualizations, as illus- trated in Figure 1. This approach effectively addresses asym- metric detection by isolating and selectively processing the target party\u2019s utterances within dialogue turns. The gener- ated explanation report enhances accessibility for non-expert users by articulating raw attribution data in natural language, and improves MGT detection interpretability by incorporat- ing semi-global model insights to balance local relevance with global interpretability. Contributions of EMMM can be summarized as follows: arXiv:2508.18715v1 [cs.CL] 26 Aug 2025 Figure 1: A demonstration of EMMM framework online detection and non-expert oriented explanation. \u2022 EMMM is Dialogue-Aware. EMMM leverages con- versation specific features to deliver multi-dimension, multi-level, and multi-strategy explanations. Grounded in speech act theory, it models dialogue structure and intent to enhance interpretability. EMMM supports both online and offline chatbot detection, achieving a balance between detection performance and explanation quality. \u2022 EMMM is Efficient. EMMM produces explanation re- ports online in under 1 second by combining a sequen- tial selector\u2013predictor pipeline with offline preprocess- ing, achieving the time efficiency required for deploy- ment in real-world service platforms. \u2022 EMMM is Interpretable. EMMM generates non-expert user friendly natural language explanation reports and includes visualizations of contextualized semi-global model behaviors to enhance model interpretability. We evaluate interpretability via qualitative analysis and a hu- man survey, showing strong user preference of 69% over a baseline attribution approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework to tackle the challenging problem of explainable MGT detec- tion for non-expert users in conversational settings, paving the way for practical, human-aligned AI safety solutions.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework to tackle the challenging problem of explainable MGT detec- tion for non-expert users in conversational settings, paving the way for practical, human-aligned AI safety solutions. 2 Related Work MGT Detection A wide range of methods have been explored for MGT de- tection, which aims to classify whether a given text was pro- duced by a human or by a LLM. Approaches include wa- termarking techniques that embed hidden signals in gener- ated content (Lu et al. 2024; Kirchenbauer et al. 2023), as well as zero-shot and supervised classification models. For example, Binoculars (Hans et al. 2024) is a statistical zero- shot method using two language models to compute an AI- likelihood score based on entropy differences, requiring no training data. In contrast, supervised models excel in spe- cialized tasks by learning meaningful patterns from labeled training data (Wu et al. 2025; Bafna et al. 2024). Existing work on MGT detection primarily focuses on text passages, overlooking the complexity and interpretative richness of online dialogues. To address this, we propose EMMM tailored for real-time detection of LLM chatbots in online dialogues, leveraging dialogue-specific features to provide explanations that non-expert users can interpret. Explaining MGT Detection Explaining a MGT detection model involves understanding its decision-making process to foster user trust and evaluate model performance (Luo et al. 2024). There are two com- mon local explanation approaches, attribution-based expla- nations and Natural Language Explanations (NLE). Attribution-based Explanations Attribution methods as- sign importance scores to input features for a specific pre- diction (Sundararajan, Taly, and Yan 2017; Tsai, Yeh, and Ravikumar 2023). This is the primary method used in ex- isting MGT detection work, identifying importance of ex- tracted attributes in feature-based detection (Shah et al. 2023), or tokens and phrases in pretrained language model (PLM)\u2013based approaches (Schoenegger, Xia, and Roth 2024). Token and phrase attribution has been widely applied in tasks such as sentiment analysis and reading comprehen- sion, where the importance scores are expected to align with intuitively relevant input regions for interpretability (Tsang, Rambhatla, and Liu 2020). However, MGT detection lacks ground-truth important tokens, making interpretation more challenging. Global aggregation of local explanations can reveal broader model patterns to assist interpretation (Mor, Belinkov, and Kimelfeld 2024) but lacks relevance to indi- vidual predictions. We address this by providing semi-global model insights contextualized by target samples, enabling a higher-level yet relevant understanding of model behavior. Natural Language Explanations (NLE) NLE methods generate textual explanations for model predictions. Unlike raw attribution scores, which can be difficult for users to in- terpret, they aim to produce explanations that better",

Natural Language Explanations (NLE) NLE methods generate textual explanations for model predictions. Unlike raw attribution scores, which can be difficult for users to in- terpret, they aim to produce explanations that better align with human understanding and values. These methods fall into two categories: generation-based and template-based. In Explanation During detection, the model gives each token and action a score that shows how much it influenced the prediction. Aggregating Language Use If the utterance is detected as human-generated, the scores are usually at or below the threshold (shown in blue or no color). If it's detected as Al-generated, the scores are generally above the threshold (shown in red). The utterance performs actions. The following word clouds represent common language patterns contrubuting toward Al and Human classification respectively, Token-Based Explanation when expressing these actions. The model considers \"user: Hi, I'm looking for a vacation package from Calgary to St. Louis from August 17 to August 31 for one person. Any options?\" likely to be Al-generated. This is because 53.57% of its tokens exhibit patterns typically found in Al responses. | | | | | | | | | Al Human | For instance, in sentence 2, the token \"?\" appears in the end, immediately following \"options\" \u2014 a phrase structure commonly alright ho to be back \u00bb 1 want to | | | | | | | | | | observed in Al communication. i'm looking at tl,\u2019 20 to ced a you se be eee by. \"s a\" \u2018pt embe Cm Such usage patterns contribute to the model's decision, as they reflect stylistic or syntactic choices characteristic of Al Cc a n y' O u h e l p ? saves Like, to on aug ust .<str_date> to-28 tte . \u00b0 7 e <str_date> t utterances Pno specific dates dom \"t match my is that the dates don can heey Sua fom september 12 \u00ab is that doesn \u2018 ? are there any ee a t ember of Peny other longer \"ve been. hiding hav any re Conime ndati on Sp? a PN \u00a9 ees, a are those the same period i would \u00a7 p w 4 any.

While flexible, they often require datasets with labeled ex- planations for training (Yordanov et al. 2022; Marasovic et al. 2022). This poses a challenge for MGT detection due to the lack of NLE-labeled data, and limited understand- ing of the differences between human and LLM chatbots in dialogue settings for NLE labeling. Prior attempts at NLE annotation targeted text passages and relied on domain ex- perts, which is costly and not feasible at scale (Ji et al. 2024; Russell, Karpinska, and Iyyer 2025). Template-based ap- proaches offer a more practical alternative to enhance inter- pretability of raw explanation data, by defining explanation sentence templates filled in per sample (Zhang and Chen 2020). We propose a novel template using attribution in- sights to generate human-readable and interpretable expla- nations efficiently. This approach does not require prior in- tuition about the detection task for NLE annotation. Explanations for Non-experts Human-understandable explanations are widely recognized for their benefits, including improved efficiency and broader stakeholder coverage (Cambria et al. 2023). They aim to convey a model\u2019s decision-making process to non-expert users, often through natural language (Burton, Moubayed, and Enshaei 2023) or intuitive visualizations (Kang et al. 2025) that make complex model behavior more accessible. Recent work has incorporated human\u2013computer interaction (HCI) principles to guide the design of explanations, with naturalness, flexibility, and usefulness consistently emerging as critical factors (Chromik and Butz 2021; Ji et al. 2024). Building on these insights, our research focuses on these three aspects in designing explanation reports, resulting in explanations that are better aligned with human values.",

Building on these insights, our research focuses on these three aspects in designing explanation reports, resulting in explanations that are better aligned with human values. 3 Our Framework - EMMM Due to the unique characteristics of multi-turn dialogues and the need for transparency in model decisions, we propose EMMM, an explainable detection framework designed to address key challenges in MGT detection within conversa- tional settings. EMMM stands for Multi-Dimensional and Multi-Level detection and explanation, and Multi-Strategy explanation reporting. The overall process of EMMM is il- lustrated in Figure 2 and can be summarized as follows for each turn during an online conversation: 1. Arrival of new user utterance: A new user utterance arrives, with sensitive information masked. 2. Dialogue acts extraction: dialogue acts (DAs) are ex- tracted from the user utterance. 3. Turn-level detection: Multi-dimensional detection is performed using the DAs and the utterance respectively. 4. Attribution explanation: Important features (DAs and tokens) from the current turn are identified. 5. Aggregate important features across turns: DAs and utterances from all turns are concatenated, while unim- portant features are replaced by mask tokens. 6. Dialogue-level detection: Detection is performed using the masked dialogue-level features. 7. Explanation report: An explanation report is generated. During offline chatbot detection, all utterances are readily available to undergo steps 2 to 5 before the framework pro- ceeds to step 6 for dialogue-level detection. With the overall workflow established, the following sec- tions describe the core components of EMMM, detailing how it realizes its objectives through: (i) Multi-Dimensional detection and explanation, integrating both linguistic signals and user behavior for richer interpretability; (ii) Multi-Level detection and explanation, enabling efficient hierarchical de- tection across turns and dialogues; and (iii) Multi-Strategy explanation reporting, delivering natural language local ex- planations complemented by semi-global visual insights for enhanced transparency. Multi-Dimensional Detection and Explanation Speech act theory states that language use not only con- veys information but also performs actions through ut- terances (Austin 1975). Dialogue Acts (DAs) encode the speaker\u2019s intent and the pragmatic function of each utter- ance. For example, the DA (inform, hotel, area, west) indi- cates a user informing a hotel area preference. Existing ap- proaches to MGT detection and explanation predominantly \u2018THE UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE Hello, how can | help you?

    "for a guesthouse in the east with free WIFI. | have a few options that match your criteria. ... Bu rely on raw tokens, overlooking such structured communica- tive functions that offer a behavior-oriented perspective be- yond surface-level linguistic cues. This motivates our use of DA extraction to capture user intent and support richer Multi-Dimensional explanations. We omit the value element (e.g., \u201cwest\u201d) to abstract away from specific slot values and focus on the underlying behavioral intent. Multi-Level Detection and Explanation Multi-turn dialogues arrive incrementally, and users expect real-time feedback. As feature attribution costs grow expo- nentially with accumulating features across turns, dialogue- level explanations become computationally expensive. To enable efficient Multi-Level explanation, EMMM employs a sequential selector\u2013predictor design (Luo et al. 2024): the selector identifies important features from turn-level attribu- tions, which are concatenated and passed as the dialogue- level explanation to the dialogue-level predictor. This elim- inates the need to recompute the full explanation with each new utterance, and remains faithful by ensuring the predictor relies only on the provided explanations. Multi-Strategy Explanation Report Our proposed explanation reporting integrates two comple- mentary strategies: local narrative explanations and contex- tualized semi-global visual insights. Unlike prior single- modality approaches, this combination unites natural lan- guage narratives with visual representations, yielding expla- nations that enhanced the understanding of non-expert users. An example explanation report is shown in Figure 1. Narrative Explanation For narrative explanations, we design a lightweight natural language template to meet the requirement of low computational complexity. It includes a background introduction providing context about the input and classification task, as well token-level and DA-level ex- planations that use natural language to aid human interpre- tation of the attributions. Inspired by HCI principles for ex- plainable AI (Chromik and Butz 2021) and discourse anal- ysis techniques (Liew et al. 2024), we prioritize three crite- ria: naturalness, flexibility, and usefulness. Naturalness cap- tures how easily users can comprehend the model\u2019s output. Flexibility reflects the ability to convey multiple perspec- tives and information types. Usefulness measures the effec- tiveness of the explanation to resolve users\u2019 potential confu- sion about detection results. Discourse-aware elements, such as highlighting rhetorical patterns, help bridge the gap be- tween technical attributions and non-expert understanding. The template was iteratively refined with input from experts and user feedback, to ensure clarity and accessibility without compromising efficiency. Contextualized Semi-global Aggregation To comple- ment the local narrative explanation, we propose Contex- tualized Semi-Global Visualization, which addresses the limited relevance of global model insights to specific tar- get samples. Existing methods aggregate local explanations across datasets to derive global insights, but often fail to re- flect the context of individual samples, limiting their support for instance-level user understanding.

This contextualized aggregation produces semi-global insights that better align with the target sample. Algorithms 1 and 2 describe the computation of DA-based aggregation scores across a dataset and their use in the online explanation process for a target utterance. A feature refers to a token or phrase extracted from text spans associated with a specific DA. During the offline phase (Algorithm 1), local attribution scores are computed for each token in the dataset using attribution methods, and phrase-level scores are ob- tained by averaging the attributions of constituent tokens. Features are grouped by DA type, and attribution scores are aggregated across features within the same group using global aggregation methods, producing DA-specific attribu- tion profiles for each class. The top ranked features per DA for the AI and Human classes are recorded with their associ- ated scores. During online application (Algorithm 2), semi- global important features are extracted by retrieving and ac- cumulating scores of the top features for each DA in the tar- get utterance. This DA-aware aggregation balances the in- terpretability of global model insights with the contextual relevance of local explanations. Implementation details, in- cluding feature matching between DAs and text spans, and word cloud construction, are provided in Appendix A.

    "A. EMMM Implementation EMMM supports flexible integration of different detection models and feature attribution methods. We conducted ex- tensive experiments based on detection performance to de- termine an effective configuration. The chosen implementa- tion fine-tunes a DistilGPT2 model (Sanh et al. 2019) for both turn-level act-based and utterance-based detection. For feature attribution, we apply Faith-SHAP (Tsai, Yeh, and Ravikumar 2023) to identify up to three dialogue acts and three tokens per utterance with the highest absolute attribu- tion scores. The turn-level detection models are further fine- tuned using the most influential acts and tokens across all turns to enable dialogue-level detection. Act and token em- beddings are combined via average fusion and passed into the final classification layer. DA extraction uses a supervised model (Zhu et al. 2023) for the SPADE dataset, and few shot prompting Qwen2.5-7B (Qwen Team 2024) for Frames. Ex- perimental details are provided in Appendix B. 4 Experimental Methodology Datasets We experiment on two datasets. SPADE (Li et al. 2025) is the only benchmark for LLM chatbot detection in conversa- tional settings, containing hotel-domain bona fide from the MultiWOZ dataset (Eric et al. 2020) and LLM-generated di- alogues. We use its End-to-End Conversation dataset, where two LLM instances simulate a conversation, acting as sys- tem and user respectively to achieve the user goal (Li et al. 2025). To expand domain coverage, we extend its data generation framework to the travel-domain Frames dataset (Schulz et al. 2017) using Qwen2.5-32B (Qwen Team 2024). This results in a new dataset comprising 1364 pairs of bona fide and synthetic dialogues. Dataset genera- tion details are provided in Appendix D. We randomly di- vide each dataset by dialogue ID into training, validation, and test sets in a 70%/15%/15% ratio. Evaluation Metrics The framework is evaluated on four key criteria essential for human-aligned deployment of LLM chatbot detection mod- els in real-world applications: \u2022 Detection Performance is measured by Macro-F1 score, where higher values indicate better performance. Super- vised non-deterministic models are run four times, and results are averaged. \u2022 Explanation Relevance is measured by AOPCk(G, c) metric (Mor, Belinkov, and Kimelfeld 2024), which quantifies the impact of the top k features from aggre- gation G on class c predictions. Higher scores reflect stronger relevance and alignment with model behavior. \u2022 Interpretability is evaluated via a human survey, com- paring user preference between EMMM explanation re- port and the baseline attribution explanation. \u2022 Time Complexity for each step of the framework is mea- sured in seconds per utterance.

For pretrained super- vised models, we evaluate RADAR (Hu, Chen, and Ho 2023) and ChatGPTDroberta (Guo et al. 2023) using their of- ficially released weights without additional fine-tuning. We also compare against supervised models trained on the tar- get datasets, including Raidarllama (Mao et al. 2024) using their llama2 7b chat implementation, entropy-based detec- tion (Gehrmann, Strobelt, and Rush 2019; Li et al. 2025) computed with TF-IDF features, and both random forest and multilayer perceptron (MLP) trained on TF-IDF embed- dings. Model and training details are in Appendix B. For explanation interpretability evaluation, our explana- tion report is compared against the content of local feature attribution methods, which is the primary existing approach for explaining MGT detection models (Shah et al. 2023; Schoenegger, Xia, and Roth 2024). 5 Experimental Results Detection Performance: Does EMMM detect MGT accurately? During detection, user utterances are extracted from the di- alogues and concatenated as input to the detection models. Table 1 presents the Macro-F1 score of detection models. Our framework, EMMM, maintains state-of-the-art detec- tion performance, achieving an average Macro-F1 of 0.9858. As detailed in Section 3, EMMM employs a sequential se- lector\u2013predictor pipeline designed to provide efficient and detailed interpretability, avoiding the costly generation of explanations for the entire dialogue. Despite using only three tokens and three dialogue acts per utterance, EMMM consistently outperforms zero-shot, pre-trained supervised, and most fully supervised baselines. This shows that our proposed framework offers reliable detection performance while advancing the efficiency and explainability required for real-world, human-aligned deployment. Table 2 compares detection performance under differ- ent attribution methods and feature budgets per utterance.

Best scores per group are bolded, second-best are underlined. The attribution methods include Faith-SHAP (Tsai, Yeh, and Ravikumar 2023), Shapley Taylor Interaction Index (Sun- dararajan, Dhamdhere, and Agarwal 2020), and Integrated Gradients (Sundararajan, Taly, and Yan 2017), covering both white-box techniques and model-agnostic approaches that approximate the Shapley values (Shapley 1953). Faith- SHAP consistently ranks first or second in Macro-F1, demonstrating its reliability and effectiveness in identify- ing salient features. Nevertheless, all attribution methods achieve strong performance under strict interpretability con- straints (> 0.9 Macro-F1), underscoring the framework\u2019s ro- bustness across different implementations. Explanation Relevance: Are aggregated explanations relevant to local predictions? This study applies two aggregation metrics: (1) AGG, pro- posed for global aggregation of local explanations (Mor, Be- linkov, and Kimelfeld 2024), and (2) log odds ratio with in- formative Dirichlet prior (LOR), designed to identify dispro- portionate word usage between two corpora (Monroe, Co- laresi, and Quinn 2008). Based on feature attributions in the training dataset, we define two corpora: the AI corpus, con- taining features with positive attribution toward AI predic- tions, and the Human corpus, containing features with neg- ative attribution. For AGG, originally applied to \u201canchors\u201d Figure 4: An example comparison of contextualized semi- global and global aggregation. selected as important features for a prediction of class c, we analogously define the anchor frequency of a token t for class c as its frequency in the corresponding corpus of the class c. LOR uses the two corpora directly as input. Figure 3 presents the results of the area over the perturba- tion curve (AOPC), of an EMMM turn-level utterance-based detection model. Aggregating local explanations based on dialogue acts yields higher AOPC scores than global aggre- gation, with one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank tests on paired per-sample AOPCk values across k \u226420 yielding p < 0.05 in all settings of datasets, classes, and aggregation metrics. In particular, AOPC scores are lower for human-predicted samples, which aligns with prior studies showing that hu- man language exhibits greater linguistic variability (Mu\u02dcnoz- Ortiz, G\u00b4omez-Rodr\u00b4\u0131guez, and Vilares 2024).

    "how AI models make decisions. mative for understanding local predictions. For qualitative analysis, Figure 4 illustrates an example of DA-based and global aggregation. The left word cloud shows the top 20 phrases per DA, while the right shows the top 20 global phrases. The phrases are ranked by frequency- weighted LOR, highlighting high-frequency phrases dispro- portionally contributing to a class. Text size is scaled by both the weighted score and phrase length for clearer visu- alization. DA-based aggregation reveals phrases more rele- vant to the current utterance when comparing AI and human classifications. For example, AI-contributing features in- clude question-oriented phrases such as \u201cany options?\u201d and \u201cany recommendations?\u201d when stating travel needs, whereas human-contributing features tend to convey needs directly without posing questions, and may include personal con- text like \u201cmy wife\u201d, \u201cfriends\u201d, etc. In contrast, global aggre- gation highlights the most influential class-specific phrases across the dataset but lacks specificity to the target utter- ance. While long-form texts can be grouped by topic, task- oriented dialogues benefit from grouping by dialogue acts to capture relevant and detailed contextual explanations. Interpretability: Do humans prefer EMMM\u2019s explanations? We conducted a human survey to evaluate the interpretabil- ity of our output explanations. In this experiment, we ran- domly selected four representative samples, each covering a different dataset and prediction class. All 13 participants were asked to review these samples, resulting in a total of 52 survey responses. For each survey, participants in- dicate their preference between our framework\u2019s generated explanation and a baseline attribution-based explanation. A sample of our explanation is shown in Figure 1. The base- line attribution-based explanation displays the top 10 most important tokens and 3 dialogue acts (DAs) per utterance, sorted by descending absolute attribution scores. Attribution scores are provided for both tokens and DAs. Further details about the survey design are provided in Appendix C. To as- sess how well our explanations support both expert and non- expert users, we divided participants into two groups: one with prior knowledge of how AI models typically make de- Step Module SPADE Frames 2 DA Extraction 0.8449 3.4771 3 Turn-level Detection 0.0336 0.0335 4 Attribution Explanation 0.5157 0.4334 5,6 Dialogue-level Detection 0.3599 0.3633 7 Explanation Report 0.4379 0.3893 4,7 Explanation 0.9536 0.8227 1-7 Framework 2.1921 4.6966 Table 3: Breakdown of framework average time complexity per utterance in seconds.

    "training. Figure 5 summarizes the survey results. In general, 69% of the participant responses preferred the explanations gen- erated by our framework over attribution-based methods. Participants without prior knowledge of how AI models make decisions showed an even stronger preference for our framework (71.42%), compared to those with relevant background knowledge (66.67%). These results suggest that our explanation framework offers general advantages across user groups, particularly in enhancing accessibility and in- terpretability for non-technical users. This highlights its po- tential for real-world applications where explanations need to be interpretable by a broad audience. To further support our conclusion, we evaluate the explanations generated by EMMM based on three HCI principles, with the score ratios provided in Appendix C. Time Complexity: Can it run in real time? We evaluated the time complexity of our detection explana- tion framework by averaging the runtime over 100 randomly selected utterances from each dataset. Table 3 provides a de- tailed breakdown of the time consumed by each step within the framework. Report generation is highly efficient, completing within 0.5 second by leveraging pre-computed aggregation scores and natural language templates. The overall explanation pro- cess, including attribution and report generation, remains under one second, demonstrating suitability for near real- time applications. Notably, dialogue act extraction is the pri- mary bottleneck, especially for the Frames dataset where LLM-based extraction takes over 3 seconds. This step can be replaced by a supervised model for greater efficiency, as shown by SPADE with runtime under one second. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we present EMMM, the first explainable chat- bot detection framework tailored for LLM-generated con- tent in conversational settings. EMMM addresses critical challenges in chatbot detection, including dialogue-specific structure and the interpretability gap for non-expert users. Through a dialogue-aware architecture and an efficient se- lector\u2013predictor pipeline, EMMM achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy while delivering turn and dialogue-level explanations within real-time constraints.

Singa- pore: Association for Computational Linguistics. A Contextualized Semi-global Aggregation Text-DA Matching The function ExtractFeaturesPerDA(D, DA) in Algorithm 1 extracts all token or phrasal features in all user utterances in the dataset D that are matched to a specific DA. Given an utterance (Tutt) and the associated DAs (DAutt with |DAutt| \u22651), we aim to find utterance text spans asso- ciated with each DA. An embedding-based approach is used to find matching pairs of utterance tokens and DAs: 1. Convert each DAi (intent, domain, slot, value) to a text string TDA,i in format \u201c{intent or intent description} {slot and optionally (slot description)} {value}\u201d. For ex- ample, (inform, travel, or city, Gotham City) is converted to \u201cinform or city (Origin city) Gotham City\u201d. Whereas non-natural language intents like \u201cnobook\u201d is replaced by their description of \u201cbooking is",
    "to a text string TDA,i in format \u201c{intent or intent description} {slot and optionally (slot description)} {value}\u201d. For ex- ample, (inform, travel, or city, Gotham City) is converted to \u201cinform or city (Origin city) Gotham City\u201d. Whereas non-natural language intents like \u201cnobook\u201d is replaced by their description of \u201cbooking is failed\u201d. 2. Encoder inference on entire utterance (Tutt), and on each individual DA text (TDA,i \u2208DAutt). This study uses a paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2 model (Reimers and Gurevych 2019) fine-tuned for 3 epochs on a balanced dataset of positive and negative samples using CosineS- imilarityLoss. For each utterance in the training set, pos- itive samples have it paired with their associated DAs (converted to text strings and concatenated), whereas negative samples have it paired with concatenated DAs of a randomly sampled utterance. 3. Extract token embeddings for each utterance token (tutt \u2208Tutt), and for each DA token (tDA \u2208TDA,i) 4. Calculate cosine similarity for each pair of utterance and DA tokens: {cos sim(tutt, tDA)|tutt \u2208Tutt, tDA \u2208 TDA,i, TDA,i \u2208DAutt} 5. Similarity between an utterance token and an entire DA is defined as the maximum similarity score be- tween the utterance token with each DA token within the DA: s(tutt, TDA,i) = max{cos sim(tutt, tDA)|tDA \u2208 TDA,i} 6. Cross-Domain Similarity Local Scaling (CSLS) (Lam- ple et al. 2018) adjusts similarity scores by increas- ing those for features with few close neighbors and de- creasing those for features with many. This reduces the influence of tokens that are broadly similar to many DAs, or vice versa, ensuring more relevant matches are prioritized. The CSLS-adjusted similarity is computed as: scsls(tutt, TDA,i) = 2 \u00b7 s(tutt, TDA,i) \u2212r(tutt) \u2212 r(TDA,i), where r(tutt) is the average of top k = 5 similarity scores between tutt and TDA,i \u2208DAutt, with r(TDA,i) computed analogously. 7. For each utterance token tutt, match it with any DA TDA,i that satisfies the condition: scsls(tutt, TDA,i) \u2265 mintutt + 0.9 \u00d7 (maxtutt \u2212mintutt), where mintutt and maxtutt denote the minimum and maximum scsls the token tutt has across all TDA,i \u2208DAutt. If a DA is matched to continuous text spans, n-gram phrases can be extracted. To enable investigation of phrase structure rather than specific values such as dates or lo- cations, these texts are replaced with special tokens (e.g., <str date>) whenever they exactly match the value compo- nent of the DAs. Word Cloud Display The top phrases selected based on aggregation scores may overlap and hinder explanation interpretation. For example, \u201clooking forward to it!\u201d, \u201clooking forward\u201d, \u201cforward\u201d may all be returned as important features. For clearer visualiza- tion, the word cloud displays features retained upon the fol- lowing de-duplication procedure: 1. Filter duplicates: retain phrases that either (1) do not have any",

For clearer visualiza- tion, the word cloud displays features retained upon the fol- lowing de-duplication procedure: 1. Filter duplicates: retain phrases that either (1) do not have any other phrases containing it or (2) do not con- tain any other phrases. For example, \u201clooking forward to it!\u201d and \u201cforward\u201d would be returned, whereas \u201clooking forward\u201d would be removed to reduce duplications. 2. Merge phrase: merge any two phrases if there exists a consecutive overlap from the 2 ends for a minimum of K = 2 tokens. For example, \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to\u201d would be merged with \u201clooking forward to it!\u201d as \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it!\u201d to further reduce replications. B Experimental Details This section details the model configurations and training specifics for both our EMMM framework and the base- line models. All experiments were conducted on a 80GB NVIDIA A100 GPU. Whenever applicable, randomness is controlled using a seed of 2025. EMMM Framework Implementation This section outlines the procedure of configuration setting for the framework implementation, and examines the robust- ness of framework performance upon different configura- tions. Detection performance reported is based on the val- idation set. Table 4 summarises the final framework imple- mentation alongside the alternative options examined. Module Alternative Implementations PLM distilgpt2, distilroberta-base, roberta-base Fusion average, concatenate, max Attribution Faith-SHAP, STII, Integrated Gradient Table 4: Chosen framework implementation is bolded. PLM Following prior work (Schoenegger, Xia, and Roth 2024; Bafna et al. 2024), PLMs are fine-tuned to serve as detection models during both turn-level and dialogue-level detection. Three PLMs are assessed based on their turn-level detection performance, as reported in Table 5. Overall, distilgpt2 and distilroberta-base demonstrate rel- atively high and stable performance across different datasets and tasks, with distilgpt2 slightly outperforming in three out of four settings. Roberta-base tends to have more un- stable convergence. Distilgpt2 is selected as the base PLM in framework implementation. PLM DA Utterance SPADE distilgpt2 0.6350 (0.0077) 0.9181 (0.0000) distilroberta-base 0.6440 (0.0035) 0.9141 (0.0000) roberta-base 0.5465 (0.1229) 0.7775 (0.0000) Frames distilgpt2 0.7372 (0.0067) 0.9789 (0.0000) distilroberta-base 0.7248 (0.0038) 0.9781 (0.0000) roberta-base 0.5635 (0.1125) 0.9802 (0.0000) Table 5: Comparison of Macro-F1 scores using different PLM for turn-level DA-based and utterance-based detection.

From Figure 6, different fusion techniques exhibit similar performance, indicating that the framework is relatively robust to the fusion method used. Average fusion shows slightly better performance than concatenation and max fusion, and is therefore used in the framework implementation. Figure 6: Comparison of Macro-F1 scores using different fusion methods for online detection when different number of turns are available progressively. Feature attribution The three feature attribution methods compared, along with their configurations, are summarized below: \u2022 Faith-SHAP (Tsai, Yeh, and Ravikumar 2023): 200 per- turbations per sample. \u2022 Shapley Taylor Interaction Index (STII) (Sundararajan, Dhamdhere, and Agarwal 2020): 50 perturbations per sample, with at least 1 perturbation per feature. The re- maining perturbations are distributed equally across fea- tures, rounding up as necessary to ensure equal alloca- tion. \u2022 Integrated gradient (Sundararajan, Taly, and Yan 2017): 100 integration steps. To select a feature attribution method, offline dialogue- level detection performance is evaluated using varying num- bers of token and DA features per utterance, selected based on the rankings of their absolute attribution scores. As shown in Table 6, Faith-SHAP consistently ranks first or sec- ond, and is thus adopted in the framework implementation. Explanation 1DA + 1token 3DA + 3token SPADE Faith-SHAP 0.9470 (0.0118) 0.9619 (0.0039) STII 0.8871 (0.0045) 0.9334 (0.0135) Integrated gradient 0.9006 (0.0106) 0.9742 (0.0024) Frames Faith-SHAP 0.9890 (0.0012) 0.9963 (0.0012) STII 0.9933 (0.0044) 0.9963 (0.0012) Integrated gradient 0.9854 (0.0017) 0.9976 (0.0000) Table 6: Macro-F1 scores for different explanation methods and maximum number of features per utterance. Standard deviations reported in brackets. Best scores per group are bolded, second-best are underlined. Hyperparameters and Training Table 7 summarizes the baseline and EMMM model hyper- parameters and training details. C Human Survey The human survey was designed to evaluate the non-expert- oriented explanations generated by our proposed frame- work, EMMM. Participants were asked to select their pre- ferred explanation for a given user utterance. Figure 7 illus- trates the traditional attribution-based explanations used as a baseline for comparison. Both baseline and EMMM expla- nations are presented with the target utterance with tokens color-coded by the attribution scores as shown at the top of Figure 1. To further validate our framework, we assess the alignment of EMMM\u2019s explanations with the three HCI principles introduced in Section 3 (naturalness, flexibility, and usefulness). Participants rated the generated explana- tions on a 5-point preference scale (where 5 indicates perfect alignment). As shown in Table 8, EMMM achieves consis- tently high average scores across all three criteria, demon- strating strong adherence to human-centric explanation de- sign principles.

As shown in Table 8, EMMM achieves consis- tently high average scores across all three criteria, demon- strating strong adherence to human-centric explanation de- sign principles. These results empirically demonstrate that our proposed method effectively delivers user-centered in- terpretability. D Dataset Construction We applied the End-to-End Conversation Framework (Li et al. 2025) using Qwen2.5-32B (Qwen Team 2024) to gen- erate synthetic dialogues based on bona fide samples from the Frames dataset (Schulz et al. 2017). Table 9 provides an overview of the statistics of the synthetic dataset generated. The End-to-End Conversation Framework involves two LLMs that simulate a dialogue by taking on the roles of user and system to collaboratively pursue the user\u2019s goal (Li et al. 2025).

To avoid the system repeatedly confirming suc- cessful searches and resulting in overly short dialogues, we guide dialogue progression by supplying the system with both user goals and their outcomes. The goal template used aligns with the description of original Frames dataset con- struction (Schulz et al. 2017).

Table 10 presents the prompt structure used to extract goals and outcomes from bona-fide dialogues. To ensure the system does not reference unre- vealed user goals, we introduce an admin LLM that mon- itors the current goal based on dialogue history, mirroring the dynamic goal updates mechanism in the original Frames data collection process.

Components Prompt Goal Generate the progression of goals and outcomes for the user in the dialogue. **GOAL**: Defines user\u2019s requirements for vacation packages, including origin, destination(s), dates, number of travelers, budget, flexibility, and preferences. Each goal should reflect either: 1. The initial request from the user, or 2. An alternative suggested by the user after the system fails to meet the previous goal. If a goal was unsuccessful, the user either ended the dialogue or continued with an **alternative goal**, which must begin with: \u201cIf nothing matches your constraints, ...\u201d Please differentiate between multiple options within the same goal and alternative goals. They are characterized as follows: 1. Options within the same goal: The user modifies previously specified constraints voluntarily to explore and compare different options, even when the system has already returned packages that match their earlier constraints. 2. Alternative goal: The user modifies constraints as a fallback because the system was unable to find any matching packages with the original constraints. This must start with \u201cIf nothing matches your constraints, ...\u201d. Alternative goals can also include multiple options within the same goal. Goal Templates: For the initial goal: <GOAL>Find a vacation between [START DATE] and [END DATE] for [NUM ADULTS] adults and [NUM CHILDREN] kids. You leave from [ORIGIN CITY]. You want to go to [DESTINATION CITY]. You are travelling on a budget and would like to spend at most $[BUDGET]. </GOAL> For any subsequent goal: <ALT GOAL>If nothing matches your constraints, [describe alternative criteria change like chang- ing dates, destinations, budget, etc.] </ALT GOAL> Outcome **OUTCOME**: Defines the vacation packages or suggestions the system returned",

Components Prompt Task Task: Simulate as an user with a particular goal and generate one response to a task oriented dialogue system. Response must start with \u201cuser: \u201d. After you achieved all your goals, end the conversation and generate \u201c[END]\u201d token. If you think the system cannot help you or the conversation falls into an infinite loop, generate a \u201c[STOP]\u201d token. The response must be one line only! The information you can ask for or provide (include everything is not mandatory): [ontology slot value] Information with \u201cmask token\u201d specified must be replaced by corresponding token in your response.

Example Here are demonstration dialogues unrelated to your own goal: [demonstrations] Do not copy anything from the demonstration! Goal Here is your goal: [goal] Move through the goals in sequential order when preceding goals cannot be completed. Response You should end conversation only once a booking is successfully made by the system, or that none of the goals can be satisfied. Do not generate \u201dEND\u201d when requesting a booking.

    "Published as a conference paper at COLM 2025 Filtering for Creativity: Adaptive Prompting for Multilingual Riddle Generation in LLMs Duy Le, Kent Ziti, Evan Girard-Sun, Sean O\u2019Brien, Vasu Sharma, Kevin Zhu Algoverse AI Research Kevin@algoverse.us Abstract Multilingual riddle generation challenges large language models (LLMs) to balance cultural fluency with creative abstraction. Standard prompting strategies\u2014zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought\u2014tend to reuse memo- rized riddles or perform shallow paraphrasing. We introduce Adaptive Originality Filtering (AOF), a prompting framework that filters redundant generations using cosine-based similarity rejection, while enforcing lexical novelty and cross-lingual fidelity. Evaluated across three LLMs and four lan- guage pairs, AOF-enhanced GPT-4o achieves 0.177 Self-BLEU and 0.915 Distinct-2 in Japanese, signaling improved lexical diversity and reduced redundancy compared to other prompting methods and language pairs. Our findings show that semantic rejection can guide culturally grounded, creative generation without task-specific fine-tuning. 1 Introduction Large Language Models (LLMs) excel across many natural language processing tasks but often falter in creative generation within multilingual settings (Zhang (2025); Ismayilzada et al. (2024)). This limitation is especially apparent in bilingual riddle generation, where outputs are frequently rote and easily found online. To address this, we propose Adaptive Originality Filtering (AOF)\u2014a prompting framework that promotes cultural specificity and lexical novelty without fine-tuning. AOF employs a semantic rejection mechanism to discard formulaic outputs and iteratively prompt the model until it produces a response that is both original and culturally coherent. In contrast to existing strategies like zero-shot, few-shot Brown et al. (2020a), and chain-of-thought prompting Wei et al. (2023), which often yield paraphrased common riddles, AOF actively steers generation toward novelty and cultural fidelity. We ask: Can prompting alone enable culturally aware, original bilingual generation in LLMs? To explore this, we apply AOF to three state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, LLaMA 3.1, DeepSeek) across four language pairs, benchmarking against four standard prompting baselines. We evaluate using metrics for lexical diversity (Distinct-n), redundancy (Self- BLEU), bilingual semantic alignment (Cross-Lingual BERTScore), and syntactic validity. Results show that AOF significantly improves both originality and cross-cultural alignment. By injecting an external filtering loop into prompting, AOF offers a lightweight, scalable path toward more creative and culturally attuned multilingual generation (see Figure 1). 2 Related Work Most prior research emphasizes riddle solving rather than generation. Panagiotopoulos et al. (2024) and Heavey et al. (2024) developed multilingual inference models for riddle solving but did not extend to generative tasks. Xu et al. (2022) incorporated cultural embeddings for Chinese riddle comprehension, while Smith et al. (2022) evaluated NLG models on static benchmarks without multilingual or generative scope.

The process begins with enforcing constraints on novelty and structure. Model outputs are then checked for semantic similarity using MiniLM, with a threshold score of < 0.75 determining acceptance. Outputs that fail are regenerated (Retry), while accepted samples undergo final evaluation. not figurative or culturally grounded generation. Sentence-level encoders Xia et al. (2019); Gritta & Iacobacci (2021) improve alignment but lack capacity for creative language. Dufter (2021) noted that such embeddings often collapse metaphorical nuance essential to cultural generation. Creative Language Generation Creative generation research has largely focused on ideation and open-domain tasks Ma et al. (2025). Cox et al. (2021; 2023) used structured prompts for idea diversity, while Huang et al. (2023) improved multilingual output via cross-lingual-thought prompting without filtering. Constraint-based methods like Yang et al. (2022) and Laverghetta Jr et al. (2024) use decoding control or heuristics to boost diversity. Structural prompting has also gained traction: de Wynter et al. (2023) introduced recursive meta-prompts, Verma et al. (2024) identified abstraction limits in ReAct prompting, and Liu et al. (2024) applied paraphrasing under semantic constraints. Atmakuru et al. (2024) bench- marked narrative creativity under fixed templates, highlighting rejection-based filtering as a viable originality enhancer. Prompting for Originality and Structure Standard approaches prioritize structure over creativity. Few-shot prompting Brown et al. (2020a;b) and CoT Wei et al. (2023) improve reasoning but often replicate training artifacts. Iterative methods like Self-Refine Madaan et al. (2023), Tree-of-Thought Yao et al. (2023), and Reflexion Krishna et al. (2023) enhance fluency and factuality through retries but rarely enforce novelty. Constraint-driven prompting offers stronger generative control. COLD decoding Mou et al. (2022), EditCoT Wang et al. (2024), and Sketch-of-Thought Aytes et al. (2025) use template- based completions, while DeLorean Liu et al. (2023) integrates symbolic constraints. These techniques target structure but overlook cultural fidelity. In contrast, our method enforces novelty during decoding via cosine-based filtering and supports cross-lingual generation of culturally resonant riddles. 2 onstraints: ovel + Structure Eval BLEU, Dist., POS [Retry [accept Published as a conference paper at COLM 2025 3 Methodology This section describes the components of our multilingual riddle generation framework, including our originality-enforcing prompting method, a centralized automatic evaluation metric, human annotation protocols, experimental design, and fine-tuning our model. 3.1 Adaptive Originality Filtering (AOF) Prompting Traditional prompting",
    "[Retry [accept Published as a conference paper at COLM 2025 3 Methodology This section describes the components of our multilingual riddle generation framework, including our originality-enforcing prompting method, a centralized automatic evaluation metric, human annotation protocols, experimental design, and fine-tuning our model. 3.1 Adaptive Originality Filtering (AOF) Prompting Traditional prompting strategies such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Few-Shot improve logical coherence but frequently fall short in producing structurally novel and semantically diverse riddles. Prior work has shown that LLMs often reproduce internet riddles or paraphrase entries from BiRdQA Zhang & Wan (2022), defaulting to overused scaffolds such as \u201cI have...\u201d and \u201cWhat am I?\u201d. To address this, we propose Adaptive Originality Filtering (AOF), a prompting method designed to enforce semantic novelty, syntactic variation, and cross-lingual fidelity. Semantic Filtering. Each generated riddle rgen is compared against a reference set D = {ri}N i=1 using cosine similarity in embedding space. A candidate is accepted only if: S(rgen, D) < \u03b8, with \u03b8 = 0.75. The full formulation and reasoning for .75 appears in Appendix J.1. Rejection Sampling Loop. AOF employs rejection sampling: if a candidate fails the novelty filter, it is discarded and regenerated. This process repeats until a valid output is produced or a retry cap is reached. See Appendix J.2 for pseudocode. Prompt Constraints. Prompts used in AOF enforce specific closure formats, grammatical variation, and discourage common answers. Template rules are detailed in Appendix J. 3.2 Experimental Setup We evaluate generation across multiple LLMs and prompting strategies, comparing struc- tural, semantic, and fluency metrics in five languages. Models Evaluated. We benchmark GPT-4o, LLaMA 3.1, and DeepSeek Reasoning (R1), all queried under identical settings (temperature 0.7, token limit 3000). Prompting Strategies. We compare Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Adversar- ial Wallace et al. (2019); Ribeiro et al. (2018), and AOF prompting. Full details are provided in Appendix K. Dataset. BiRdQA Zhang & Wan (2022) provides a bilingual corpus of 15,365 riddles in English and Chinese. We sample balanced subsets and align multilingual answers. Metrics. Automatic metrics include Self-BLEU (repetition), Distinct-2 (diversity), BERTScore (alignment). Human validation is included in Appendix A. 3.3 Fine-Tuning of the GPT-4o Model Objective and Motivation This fine-tuning aimed to improve GPT-4o-2024-08-06\u2019s per- formance on riddle comprehension and generation across multiple languages. Riddles involve more than surface-level matching\u2014they require metaphor understanding, logical contradiction, and creative misdirection.

Riddles were presented in a multiple-choice format, and the model was fine-tuned using cross-entropy loss. For complete details on dataset preprocessing, training setup, and training set expansion, see Appendix I. Multiple-Choice Framing Overview Riddles were framed in a four-option multiple-choice format to encourage fine-grained discrimination between plausible distractors. This setup shaped the model\u2019s reasoning strategies and generalization capabilities. A full analysis of framing effects is provided in Appendix I.5. Prompting Strategies We evaluated five prompting strategies on the fine-tuned model: Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Adversarial, and Adaptive Originality Filter- ing (AOF). These were held consistent with the pretrained experiments. See Table 21 for full prompt templates. Model Comparison Overview We compared the fine-tuned GPT-4o to several pretrained baselines\u2014GPT-4o (pretrained), LLaMA 3.1, and DeepSeek R1\u2014using identical prompts and evaluation metrics. For detailed results and methodological discussion, see Appendix I.4. 4 AOF Pretrained Evaluations We evaluate riddle generation across three pretrained models using five prompting selecting riddle one example per method. This section blends automatic metrics with qualitative observations to assess metaphor, creativity, and syntactic variation. Representative riddles are provided in Appendices D\u2013G. For detailed quantitative results\u2014token length, Self- BLEU, Distinct-2, and syntactic validity\u2014see Appendix B. 4.1 English GPT-4o achieves moderate repetition (Self-BLEU: 0.413) as shown in Table 5 and high lexical diversity (Distinct-2: 0.852), balancing structural cohesion with surface novelty. Compared to LLaMA 3.1 (0.471 / 0.727) and DeepSeek R1 (0.339 / 0.845), its generation reflects a middle ground: less repetitive than LLaMA, but more structurally conventional than R1. The riddle in Row 1 of Table 6 incorporates contrastive metaphor in a coherent frame, supporting findings that figurative ambiguity paired with consistent syntax enhances interpretability Lakoff & Johnson (1980); Shutova (2013). This reflects controlled creativity, where lexical risk is constrained by structural regularity Binsted (1996). LLaMA 3.1 displays the strongest phrasal variation among the three models, as evidenced by a higher Distinct-2 (0.727), though with a moderate increase in repetition (Self-BLEU: 0.471). In Row 2, the riddle demonstrates rhythmic structure and concept layering, leverag- ing symmetry and internal metaphor to guide reader inference. This aligns with cognitive accounts linking memorable riddles to rhythmic and conceptual salience Koestler (1964). The AOF method appears to help LLaMA 3.1 decouple fixed templates from overused lexical forms, allowing for recompositional variety without semantic drift Fauconnier & Turner (2002). DeepSeek R1 exhibits the lowest repetition (Self-BLEU: 0.339) and highest token diversity (Distinct-2: 0.845), outperforming both GPT-4o and LLaMA 3.1 in novelty. The output in Row 3 exemplifies conceptual inversion and abstract framing, using oppositional imagery to support lateral interpretation. This",

DeepSeek R1 exhibits the lowest repetition (Self-BLEU: 0.339) and highest token diversity (Distinct-2: 0.845), outperforming both GPT-4o and LLaMA 3.1 in novelty. The output in Row 3 exemplifies conceptual inversion and abstract framing, using oppositional imagery to support lateral interpretation. This mirrors classic riddle mechanics involving duality and semantic misdirection Koestler (1964). While diversity of this magnitude sometimes correlates with fluency degradation Zhang et al. (2021), AOF appears to regulate R1\u2019s output sufficiently to retain syntactic legibility Xu et al. (2018), enabling expressive reformulations without loss of coherence. 4 Published as a conference paper at COLM 2025 4.2 Japanese GPT-4o GPT-4o\u2019s performance on metrics like self-BLEU and Distinct-n under AOF ranks around average relative to standard baselines\u2014reflecting more on metric saturation than prompting inadequacy (Yao et al. (2025), Schmidtov\u00b4a et al. (2024)). AOF resolves key flaws in traditional prompts, such as the egocentric \u201cI\u201d-imagery in chain-of-thought and overfitting in few-shot examples. These gains are not fully captured by current metrics. As shown in Table 10, GPT-4o under AOF adopts a distinct structure: a punchy first sentence followed by a more elaborate second, enhancing narrative pacing and engagement. LLaMA 3.1 While LLaMA 3.1 shows limited improvement on automated metrics using AOF, this reflects model expressiveness more than prompt quality. AOF mitigates egocentric phrasing and rote repetition seen in baseline prompts, yielding subtler gains beyond surface metrics. For instance, Table 10 features a clever use of the homophone \u300c\u3064\u308b\u300dto suggest both decorative twine and the crane (\u9db4)\u2014symbols deeply embedded in Japanese culture and Shinto ritual, such as \u3057\u3081\u7e04(shimenawa) An (2023). DeepSeek R1 DeepSeek R1\u2019s middling scores on self-BLEU and Distinct-n under AOF say more about its stylistic tendencies than the prompt\u2019s design Li et al. (2024). AOF corrects core issues in baseline methods\u2014overuse of first-person voice in chain-of-thought and example mimicry in few-shot\u2014enabling richer creativity not fully reflected in metrics. Table 10 presents a vivid example: a fish\u2019s mouth described as a \u201cquiet tree\u201d where birds sing, merging the surreal and natural in a poetically disorienting twist. 4.3 Arabic GPT-4o GPT-4o shows moderate repetition (Self-BLEU: 0.497) as shown in Table 5 and good lexical variety (Distinct-2: 0.780) with Adaptive Originality Filtering (AOF), clearly performing better than common methods like few-shot, zero-shot, chain-of-thought, and ad- versarial prompts. Unlike chain-of-thought prompts, which tend to produce straightforward, predictable metaphors, AOF helps GPT-4o create riddles with imaginative and abstract images\u2014such as something that\u2019s present but unseen\u2014as illustrated in (Figure 2, Row 1). This approach fits naturally with traditional Arabic riddles, known for their symbolic and reflective style Al-Khatib (1988). LLaMA 3.1 LLaMA 3.1 strikes an effective balance between repetition (Self-BLEU: 0.374) and creativity (Distinct-2: 0.927) through AOF,",

LLaMA 3.1 LLaMA 3.1 strikes an effective balance between repetition (Self-BLEU: 0.374) and creativity (Distinct-2: 0.927) through AOF, addressing issues often found in chain- of-thought and adversarial prompts, which frequently yield predictable or overly vague outputs. Its riddles are relatable and culturally resonant, using clear metaphors drawn from everyday life, like \u201da strong wind\u201d that can\u2019t enter a house, as shown in (Figure 2, Row 2). This connects directly to familiar poetic traditions in Arabic, avoiding common pitfalls like repetitive phrasing or loss of meaning Al-Jahiz (869). DeepSeek R1 DeepSeek R1, while somewhat repetitive (Self-BLEU: 0.585), achieves no- table depth in metaphorical expression (Distinct-2: 0.583) under AOF. This method effec- tively tackles problems seen in zero-shot, few-shot, and adversarial prompting, such as repetitive or simplistic metaphors. For example, DeepSeek R1 creatively portrays a rooftop as an eye \u201dfed by the city,\u201d as seen in (Figure 2, Row 3), mixing urban imagery with striking vi- sual symbolism. This clever blending of abstract ideas and real-world images strongly aligns with Arabic poetry, known for its layers of meaning and subtle metaphors Al-Marzouki (2012). By encouraging culturally rich riddles, AOF clearly boosts the originality and depth of DeepSeek R1\u2019s outputs compared to simpler prompting strategies Xu et al. (2018). 4.4 French GPT-4o GPT-4o\u2019s pretrained riddles are grammatically solid and easy to understand, but they often feel like lifted translations of English puzzles. For example, it offers the riddle in Row 1 of Table 17, a fluent but familiar \u201ccloud\u201d trope. The phrasing remains 5 Published as a conference paper at COLM 2025 straightforward, with minimal use of inversion or enjambment that one might expect in classic French \u00b4enigmes Chan (1996). Even when prompted for more creativity, GPT-4o tends to default back to elemental imagery\u2014wind, water, shadows\u2014rather than exploring urban or abstract concepts. Answerability is never in doubt, but the surface novelty and cultural resonance remain modest. This is reflected in a Self-BLEU of 0.413 and Distinct-2 of 0.852 as shown in Table 5, suggesting moderate repetition and relatively strong lexical variety. DeepSeek R1 DeepSeek R1 generates concise and structurally consistent riddles, yet it leans heavily on classic \u201criver\u201d or \u201cecho\u201d formats. A typical example, shown in Row 2, feels like a direct adaptation of childhood puzzles, with little lexical or rhythmic inno- vation Meulemans (2005). Attempts to push deeper\u2014such as referencing time, memory, or abstract concepts\u2014often collapse back into familiar patterns. Even in adversarial or chain-of-thought modes, R1 seldom ventures beyond these safe metaphors. The result is always coherent but predictable,",
    "direct adaptation of childhood puzzles, with little lexical or rhythmic inno- vation Meulemans (2005). Attempts to push deeper\u2014such as referencing time, memory, or abstract concepts\u2014often collapse back into familiar patterns. Even in adversarial or chain-of-thought modes, R1 seldom ventures beyond these safe metaphors. The result is always coherent but predictable, with cultural idioms and advanced metaphorical shifts under-utilized. This pattern yields a low Self-BLEU of 0.339 and a high Distinct-2 of 0.845, indicating minimal paraphrastic overlap and strong surface novelty. LLaMA 3.1 LLaMA 3.1 shows the greatest stylistic range\u2014some riddles stumble through literal phrasing, while others introduce intriguing wordplay. Row 3 plays with poetic misdirection (\u201cdanse\u201d / \u201cris\u201d), while Row 4 experiments with digital metaphor (\u201ccurseur\u201d), reflecting a willingness to stretch genre boundaries. These flashes of originality are countered by examples that revert to stilted syntax or literal templates. Overall, LLaMA\u2019s pretrained outputs blend moments of genuine creativity with occasional lapses into generic phrasing, suggesting strong potential but inconsistent performance. The variation is mirrored in its Self-BLEU score of 0.471 and Distinct-2 of 0.727, balancing moderate repetition with decent surface diversity Veale (2011). 4.5 Chinese GPT-4o GPT-4o\u2019s pretrained Chinese riddles are grammatically correct and logically coherent, but they often translate English metaphors without adapting to the script-specific strategies typical of traditional \u706f\u8c1c. As shown in Row 1 of Table 13, the imagery is literal and binary, missing multi-layered allusions like radical-based clues or idiomatic rhythm Chan (1996); Sun (2006). When prompted for variation, GPT-4o maintains syntactic fluency but rarely ventures into lexical innovation. With a Self-BLEU of 0.280 and Distinct-2 of 0.869 as in shown in Table 5, it balances mild repetition with surface diversity but lacks deeper cultural anchoring. DeepSeek R1 DeepSeek R1 outputs elegant, fluent couplets with strong adherence to classical poetic symmetry, as shown in Row 2. While it maintains strong rhythm and antithesis, its metaphors remain shallow\u2014favoring form over lexical novelty. Even when attempting radical-based clues (Row 3), the effort often feels literal rather than layered. Despite this, R1 exhibits high diversity (Distinct-2: 0.674) and moderate repetition (Self- BLEU: 0.433), suggesting a capacity for expressive phrasing that falls short of fully exploiting Chinese script-level wordplay Xu et al. (2018). LLaMA 3.1 LLaMA 3.1 demonstrates the richest cultural range. Row 4 blends visual and semantic metaphor in a style reminiscent of folk riddles, while Row 5 shows explicit use of radical-based structure. This script-aware design reflects deeper integration with Chinese morphological conventions Li (2008). Although some outputs revert to generic \u201c\u65e0... \u80fd...\u201d templates or awkward logic, LLaMA\u2019s outputs remain stylistically diverse (Distinct-2: 0.776) and moderately novel (Self-BLEU: 0.428). This suggests that the AOF prompt enables meaningful variation while retaining cultural fidelity Fauconnier & Turner (2002). 6 Published",

One bolded cell per language pair shows the best combined performance (lowest Self-BLEU and highest Distinct-2). 5 Fine-Tuned vs. Pretrained Riddle Generation We compare GPT-4o before and after fine-tuning across five prompting strategies. Quantita- tive metrics\u2014token length, Self-BLEU, and Distinct-2\u2014are complemented by qualitative analysis of metaphorical framing, structural variation, and bilingual phrasing. Representa- tive pairs are shown in Appendices D\u2013G. 5.1 English Fine-tuning reduces token length (e.g., Zero-Shot: 1112\u2192799) and Self-BLEU (0.391\u21920.233) while maintaining Distinct-2 (0.787\u21920.835). Pretrained outputs often mirror real-world riddles through polysemy or personification (Table 7, Row 1), while fine-tuned variants adopt metaphorical abstraction and cleaner phrasing. Few-shot fine-tuning increases expres- siveness via metaphorical phrases like \u201cunseen roads,\u201d though at the cost of verbosity (Row 2). CoT prompts benefit most: binary contrasts replace triplet lists, yielding minimal length (730 tokens) and high lexical spread (Distinct-2 = 0.831, Row 3). AOF produces the most novel riddles with metaphorical stillness (e.g., \u201cquietest word\u201d) and the strongest metrics overall (Self-BLEU = 0.260, Distinct-2 = 0.893, Row 4). Adversarial fine-tuning intensifies abstraction, shifting from clouds to time-as-erosion metaphors (Row 5), with moderate Self-BLEU (0.320) and strong Distinct-2 (0.810). 5.2 Japanese Fine-tuning enhances morphosyntactic fluency and metaphorical depth across all prompting methods. In Zero-Shot (Table 11, Row 1), redundancy declines (Self-BLEU: 0.431\u21920.364) and alignment with Japanese poetic rhythm improves. Few-shot prompts (Row 2) exhibit clearer clause structure and cultural framing, raising Distinct-2 (0.605\u21920.778). CoT outputs (Row 3) shift from formulaic \u201cI. . . \u201d templates to more idiomatic bilingual logic, improving Self-BLEU (0.532\u21920.386) and shortening length (1169\u2192753).

Adversarial riddles (Row 4) gain fluency and metaphor variation while reducing structural awkwardness. AOF (Row 5) yields 7 Published as a conference paper at COLM 2025 the largest qualitative improvement, enhancing metaphor density and cultural cadence alongside a major Self-BLEU drop (0.483\u21920.177) and Distinct-2 increase (0.697\u21920.915). 5.3 Chinese Fine-tuning enhances metaphorical depth and structural variety. In Zero-Shot (Table 14, Row 1), the shift from rigid constructions (e.g., \u201c\u65e0...\u80fd...\u201d) to smoother phrasing results in lower Self-BLEU (0.335\u21920.315). Few-shot fine-tuning (Row 2) preserves metaphor (e.g., fruit riddles) but avoids repetitive idioms, maintaining high Distinct-2 (0.787). CoT outputs (Row 3) become more concise (1169\u2192860 tokens) and morphosyntactically fluent. Adversarial prompts (Row 4) retain metaphor but improve cadence and cohesion (Self-BLEU: 0.363\u21920.400). AOF (Row 5) again leads in lexical variety (Distinct-2: 0.934) and minimal redundancy (Self-BLEU: 0.163), producing abstract yet bilingual-consistent metaphors. 5.4 Arabic In zero-shot (Table 3, Row 1), fine-tuned riddles replace rigid \u201cX without Y\u201d scaffolds with rhythmic phrasing and internal rhyme, reducing Self-BLEU (0.391\u21920.260) and raising Distinct-2 (0.752\u21920.893). Few-shot outputs (Row 2) drop repetitive clause frames in favor of enjambment and root variation, yielding more lexical diversity (Distinct-2: 0.910) and lower redundancy (Self-BLEU: 0.245). CoT riddles (Row 3) become more compact and id- iomatic, improving Distinct-2 (0.828) while reducing Self-BLEU (0.412\u21920.326). Adversarial prompting (Row 4) shifts from binary contrast to triadic parallelism and poetic misdirection, achieving the lowest Self-BLEU (0.177) and highest Distinct-2 (0.915). AOF (Row 5) sustains peak diversity (0.893) while filtering out formulaic phrasing, better aligning with Arabic poetic conventions. 5.5 French Fine-tuning reduces overuse of literal templates like \u201cQu\u2019est-ce qui...\u201d and enhances lex- ical diversity across all prompts. Zero-Shot outputs (Table 18, Row 1) shift from for- mulaic rhythms to varied idiomatic constructions (Self-BLEU: 0.451\u21920.256, Distinct-2: 0.833\u21920.892). Few-shot fine-tuned riddles (Row 2) are more concise (2982\u21922005 tokens) and metaphorically fresh. CoT (Row 3) yields the strongest tradeoff: shorter outputs (753 tokens), lower Self-BLEU (0.444\u21920.326), and improved diversity (Distinct-2: 0.733\u21920.831). Adversarial fine-tuning (Row 4) avoids clunky phrasing while maintaining misdirection. AOF (Row 5) produces the most idiomatic and semantically novel French riddles, with Self-BLEU dropping to 0.260 and Distinct-2 peaking at 0.893. 6 Fine-Tuned Riddle Comparison to Real World We evaluate fine-tuned riddle generations across five prompting strategies by comparing them to their closest literary or folkloric counterparts. This comparison focuses on structural fidelity, metaphorical depth, and cultural alignment. Language-specific analyses are pro- vided in Appendix A, which details how fine-tuned outputs differ from real-world riddles in phrasing, abstraction, and stylistic form. 7 Conclusion This paper introduced Adaptive Originality Filtering (AOF), a prompting framework de- signed",

Language-specific analyses are pro- vided in Appendix A, which details how fine-tuned outputs differ from real-world riddles in phrasing, abstraction, and stylistic form. 7 Conclusion This paper introduced Adaptive Originality Filtering (AOF), a prompting framework de- signed to overcome originality limits in bilingual riddle generation. Evaluated across four language pairs, five prompting paradigms, and three LLMs, AOF consistently outperformed baselines in lexical diversity (Distinct-n), semantic novelty (Self-BLEU), and cross-lingual alignment. Fine-tuned GPT-4o with AOF produced the highest-quality outputs, outperform- ing both its pretrained version and open-weight models. Human evaluations confirmed that AOF-generated riddles were more metaphorically rich, structurally coherent, and culturally resonant\u2014especially in French, Japanese, Chinese, and Arabic. These findings demonstrate 8 Published as a conference paper at COLM 2025 that filtering-based prompting, particularly when combined with fine-tuning, provides a robust path toward semantically novel and linguistically sound multilingual generation. AOF marks a practical advance in prompt design for creative, cross-lingual NLP tasks. Limitations Dataset Scope We restrict our study to the BiRdQA dataset, covering 6,614 English and 8,751 Chinese riddles with multiple-choice answers. While genre-diverse, its figurative focus narrows generalizability to broader creative tasks (e.g., storytelling, allegory). Our multilingual evaluation spans five languages (EN\u2013ZH\u2013AR\u2013JA\u2013FR), excluding lower-resource or mor- phologically rich ones like Finnish or Swahili. Prompting and Sampling We fix sampling parameters (e.g., temperature, token limit) across all models to ensure comparability, potentially masking prompt\u2013parameter effects. AOF\u2019s MiniLM-based filter- ing emphasizes surface-level novelty, risking semantic redundancy undetected by cosine distance\u2014particularly in non-English outputs. Fine-Tuning Setup Our fine-tuning on GPT-4o uses BiRdQA\u2019s multiple-choice framing, enhancing structural fluency but biasing toward riddle types favoring clarity over ambiguity. Although stylistic gains are evident in token length and Self-BLEU, we omit extrinsic human metrics like puzzle difficulty or solver accuracy. Evaluation Constraints Human evaluations cover only five languages due to cost, limiting cultural generalizabil- ity. Syntactic validity checks apply solely to AOF generations, leaving other strategies unchecked structurally. Lastly, while AOF excels in novelty-structure balance, deeper human validation (e.g., creativity ratings, solve rates) remains future work. Ethics Statement Language Equity and Cultural Representation This work evaluates riddle generation across five languages\u2014English, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, and French\u2014selected for linguistic diversity and resource availability. However, our dataset and prompts reflect biases inherent to internet-derived corpora and may not fully capture the cultural or idiomatic richness of underrepresented communities. For example, certain metaphorical forms or idiomatic patterns may be overrepresented in English and underdeveloped in Arabic or Japanese, despite efforts to balance qualitative evaluation across languages. Creative Attribution and AI Authorship Riddles generated in this study may closely resemble publicly available riddles from folk- lore, educational resources, or crowdsourced riddle repositories.

    "forms or idiomatic patterns may be overrepresented in English and underdeveloped in Arabic or Japanese, despite efforts to balance qualitative evaluation across languages. Creative Attribution and AI Authorship Riddles generated in this study may closely resemble publicly available riddles from folk- lore, educational resources, or crowdsourced riddle repositories. Although our Adaptive Originality Filtering (AOF) method actively screens for semantic overlap, we acknowledge that latent training data exposures or structural mimicry may inadvertently echo human- created content. As such, we recommend that users and downstream applications of our system avoid commercial use or publication of model outputs without further originality assessment or attribution checks. 9 Published as a conference paper at COLM 2025 Data Privacy and Responsible Fine-Tuning The BiRdQA dataset used for training and evaluation contains no personally identifiable in- formation (PII). All riddles are anonymized and synthetically framed as general-knowledge metaphors. Our fine-tuning process adheres to OpenAI\u2019s guidelines for API use and oper- ates within approved token limits and safety thresholds. No user data or private content was used in training, generation, or evaluation. Misuse Risks and Interpretability While riddle generation appears benign, the creative ambiguity inherent in figurative tasks can be exploited for misinformation or manipulation, especially in politically or culturally sensitive contexts. Models capable of abstract generation may also fabricate plausible but misleading information. We caution against deploying this system in high-stakes educational, psychological, or legal settings without adequate interpretability safeguards or human oversight.

A Appendix: Fine-Tuned AOF Riddle Comparison to Real World A.1 English As shown in Table 8, Row 1, the fine-tuned riddle reimagines the original with more abstract and layered associations. Rather than relying on negated literalism, it introduces concepts like memory and time using metaphorical compression and cross-sensory cues. This approach reflects principles of conceptual integration theory, where blending disparate domains enhances figurative depth Fauconnier & Turner (2002).

    "abstract and layered associations. Rather than relying on negated literalism, it introduces concepts like memory and time using metaphorical compression and cross-sensory cues. This approach reflects principles of conceptual integration theory, where blending disparate domains enhances figurative depth Fauconnier & Turner (2002). In contrast, the real-world version is more direct, using structural opposition to achieve its effect Gentner (1983).Row 2 presents another clear shift in stylistic strategy. The real-world riddle uses static reversal\u2014a common riddle trope\u2014while the fine-tuned variant introduces paradox and disappearance as metaphors for guidance. This relies on spatial embodiment, a known technique in metaphor production Lakoff & Johnson (1980), and adds ambiguity through indirectness. Such compositional layering suggests that AOF prompts can foster more interpretively open and stylistically creative riddles than conventional examples. A.2 Japanese The riddles in AOF are guided towards direct metaphors with complex, creative, and unique word choice and sentence structure, while having creative answers like memory and beehive in Table 12 Teng & Xu (2023). These generations surpass past riddle generations flaws like lack of originality in sentence structure, just changing the pronouns or verbs to make it more creative, and etc. These riddles contrast with traditional Japanese riddles which rely on phonetic ambiguity and cultural nuance like in Table 12 where the first row features how phonetically similar words feature different meanings and the riddle in the second row yields different ways of reading through phonetically similar readingsAn (2023). A.3 Chinese Fine-tuned AOF riddles in Chinese often leverage character structure through radical-based puns and vivid imagery. For instance, the coral riddle in Table 15 blends \u201csea\u201d imagery with radical hints (\u6d77\u5e95\u85cf\u68ee\u6797...) to guide the solver\u2014a strategy supported by prior work on character-pun alignments in riddle composition Tan et al. (2016). By contrast, traditional \u706f\u8c1c(e.g., \u201c\u53e3\u888b\u91cc\u6709\u4e2a\u5706...\u201d for \u201c\u6708\u4eae\u201d) rely on simple perceptual clues and tonal balance Wei & Lee (2021). This comparison suggests that our approach enhances cultural depth by embedding multi-layered orthographic play into poetic metaphors while preserving reader accessibility. A.4 Arabic (Figure 4, Row 5) AOF stands out for its fresh language and metaphorical clarity. One riddle\u2014\u201dSomething that\u2019s full when it eats, and thirsty when it drinks\u201d\u2014relies on a simple yet clever contradiction that invites reflection. It draws on the tradition of using everyday logic to confuse and amuse, evoking the style of oral riddles that play with basic physical experiences. The second riddle\u2014\u201dI light up the night and disappear by day, visible yet unseen... What am I?\u201d\u2014is more poetic, using contrast and imagery to express something elusive and symbolic. It captures the feel of classical Arabic algh\u00afaz not through root-based punning but through layered metaphor and rhythm. Together, these examples show how AOF preserves 14 Published as a conference paper",

It captures the feel of classical Arabic algh\u00afaz not through root-based punning but through layered metaphor and rhythm.

(2022). A.5 French Fine-tuned AOF riddles in French lean into unexpected domain shifts and internal echo. The AOF example repurposes the concept of a \u201ctypo\u201d as a buzzing bee, combining internal rhyme (\u201cjardin/des mots\u201d, \u201cbourdonnant/lettres\u201d) and metaphorical layering, driving semantic playfulness and rhythmic balance (Table 19, Row 1). Internal rhyme notably enhances poetic cohesion and cognitive engagement Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2025). In contrast, canonical French \u00b4enigmes tend toward binary negation and elemental imagery (Table 19, Row 2). For instance, \u201cJe vole sans ailes, je pleure sans yeux...\u201d relies on simple antithesis without cross-domain metaphorical transfer. The AOF variant\u2019s richer conceptual mapping aligns with findings that cross-domain metaphor and internal structure boost interpretability and novelty in poetic forms Lakoff & Johnson (1999); Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2025).

It includes 6,614 English riddles and 8,751 Chinese riddles, each paired with four answer options. Riddles were shuffled at each epoch to prevent memorization, and no synthetic augmentation was applied. Its linguistic diversity\u2014spanning syntactic constructions, cultural idioms, and metaphorical phrasing\u2014made BiRdQA suitable for riddle-based fine-tuning. All data were Unicode- normalized and deduplicated, and stratified sampling ensured balanced language represen- tation. I.2 Training Strategy Fine-tuning was framed as a supervised multi-class classification problem. The model selected one correct answer out of four using cross-entropy loss. The following hyperpa- rameters were used: \u2022 Temperature: 0.7 \u2022 Token Limit: 3000 \u2022 Initial Accuracy: 37\u201359%",
    "deduplicated, and stratified sampling ensured balanced language represen- tation. I.2 Training Strategy Fine-tuning was framed as a supervised multi-class classification problem. The model selected one correct answer out of four using cross-entropy loss. The following hyperpa- rameters were used: \u2022 Temperature: 0.7 \u2022 Token Limit: 3000 \u2022 Initial Accuracy: 37\u201359% on development set Training followed a three-stage pipeline: base fine-tuning, early stopping on dev perfor- mance, and multilingual test evaluation to check generalization. I.3 Appendix:Training Set Expansion To improve abstraction and metaphor handling, the English and Chinese development sets were merged into the training pool. This added examples with closely related distractors and borderline ambiguity. After retraining, test accuracy rose to 97%. These improvements suggest the model internalized deep riddle logic, moving beyond sur- face pattern recognition and toward more sophisticated reasoning involving contradiction and misdirection. I.4 Model Comparison Methodology I.4.1 Baseline Models We benchmarked the fine-tuned GPT-4o against three models: \u2022 Pretrained GPT-4o (2024-08-06): Unadapted baseline. \u2022 LLaMA 3.1: An open-weight multilingual model with strong reasoning ability. \u2022 DeepSeek R1: A reasoning-optimized model focusing on step-wise logical align- ment. Each model received the same riddles under consistent prompting strategies to ensure fair comparison. I.4.2 Evaluation Procedure All models were tested under five prompting strategies (Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Chain-of- Thought, Adversarial, AOF) with identical templates (Table 21). Metrics included: \u2022 Accuracy (multiple choice prediction) 29 Published as a conference paper at COLM 2025 \u2022 Token Length (verbosity) \u2022 Self-BLEU (semantic diversity) \u2022 Distinct-2 (lexical uniqueness) Qualitative evaluations by human reviewers assessed metaphor handling, distractor dis- crimination, and cultural idiomatic fluency. I.4.3 Summary of Findings Fine-tuned GPT-4o consistently outperformed all baselines across metrics. Key observations: \u2022 Accuracy: Rose from 59% (pretrained) to 97% (fine-tuned). \u2022 Reasoning: Demonstrated superior metaphor resolution and logical contradiction handling. \u2022 Naturalness: Generated riddles more closely matched idiomatic structures in both English and Chinese. I.5 Impact of Multiple-Choice Framing Retaining a multiple-choice structure during fine-tuning had a pronounced effect on the model\u2019s ability to reason through ambiguity. Unlike generative formats where any output is valid if semantically relevant, the multiple-choice setup forced the model to: \u2022 Distinguish between semantically similar options \u2022 Engage in elimination-style reasoning \u2022 Learn disambiguation strategies aligned with riddle logic This setup simulated test-like conditions where distractors were deliberately constructed to reflect surface-level similarity (e.g., phonetic overlaps, shared imagery, or logical decoys). The model improved not only in accuracy but in inferential depth. Moreover, this format likely enhanced the model\u2019s sensitivity to misdirection\u2014a core feature of riddles\u2014by requiring it to reject reasonable but incorrect answers. We observed that this effect carried over to open-ended generation: the model became more likely to embed internal contradiction or layered metaphor, hallmarks of real-world riddles.

    "this format likely enhanced the model\u2019s sensitivity to misdirection\u2014a core feature of riddles\u2014by requiring it to reject reasonable but incorrect answers. We observed that this effect carried over to open-ended generation: the model became more likely to embed internal contradiction or layered metaphor, hallmarks of real-world riddles. In sum, multiple-choice framing served both as a task constraint and as a pedagogical scaffold, encouraging the model to develop strategies beyond rote keyword matching. J Appendix: AOF Prompt Template and Constraints The Adaptive Originality Filtering (AOF) prompt enforces explicit structural rules to maxi- mize diversity, creativity, and cultural fit. Specifically: \u2022 Syntactic Variety: At least half of the riddles must use poetic, declarative, or metaphorical forms. Fewer than 3 per batch may end in \u201cWhat am I?\u201d \u2022 Answer Filtering: Outputs with generic answers (e.g., shadow, time, echo, fire, breath) are discarded. \u2022 Cross-Lingual Parity: Translations must preserve ambiguity or metaphor across both languages. \u2022 Novelty Filter: Semantic similarity to known riddles must fall below a threshold (\u03b8 = 0.75), as measured against BiRdQA Zhang & Wan (2022). 30 Published as a conference paper at COLM 2025 J.1 Semantic Similarity Filtering Equation A candidate riddle rgen is compared to a reference dataset D = {ri}N i=1 via: S(rgen, D) = max ri\u2208D cos(\u03d5(rgen), \u03d5(ri)) (1) where \u03d5(\u00b7) is an embedding function (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2). A candidate passes if S < \u03b8 = 0.75.

    "Attention2Probability: Attention-Driven Terminology Probability Estimation for Robust Speech-to-Text System Yangfan Du1*, Jun Zhang2, Bin Wang2, Jin Qiu2, Lu Huang2, Yuan Ge1, Xiaoqian Liu1, Tong Xiao1,3\u2020, Jingbo Zhu1,3 1School of Computer Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China 2ByteDance 3NiuTrans Research, Shenyang, China duyangfan neu@outlook.com xiaotong@mail.neu.edu.cn Abstract Recent advances in speech large language models (SLMs) have improved speech recognition and translation in general domains, but accurately generating domain-specific terms or neologisms remains challenging. To address this, we propose Attention2Probability: attention-driven terminology proba- bility estimation for robust speech-to-text system, which is lightweight, flexible, and accurate. Attention2Probability converts cross-attention weights between speech and termi- nology into presence probabilities, and it further employs cur- riculum learning to enhance retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, to tackle the lack of data for speech-to-text tasks with ter- minology intervention, we create and release a new speech dataset with terminology to support future research in this area. Experimental results show that Attention2Probability significantly outperforms the VectorDB method on our test set. Specifically, its maximum recall rates reach 92.57% for Chinese and 86.83% for English. This high recall is achieved with a latency of only 8.71ms per query. Inter- vening in SLMs\u2019 recognition and translation tasks using Attention2Probability-retrieved terms improves terminology accuracy by 6\u201317%, while revealing that the current utiliza- tion of terminology by SLMs has limitations. Code, Data, Models \u2014 https://github.com/bytedance/Attention2Probability Introduction Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) (Kim, Hori, and Watanabe 2017) and Speech Translation (ST) (Xu et al. 2021) are vital for real-world applications like meeting transcription and simultaneous interpretation. Advances in Speech Large language Models (SLMs) have significantly improved their performance in general scenarios such as daily conversations (Tang et al. 2023; Chu et al. 2023). How- ever, in specialized domains such as medicine or gaming, SLMs often struggle to generate accurate technical termi- nology (Yang et al. 2024). A straightforward strategy involves leveraging collected terminological datasets to fine-tune SLMs, thereby enabling them to acquire domain-specific vocabulary (Chen et al. 2024). However, terminology evolves rapidly as new terms *Work done during internship at ByteDance. \u2020Corresponding author.

    "are jointly input into the speech large language model. emerge and old ones become obsolete daily (Coupland 2014; Morgan 2025). Fine-tuning is time-consuming, and data collection is difficult, making this approach poorly suited for dynamic terminology intervention. With SLMs\u2019 in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, new methods avoid fine-tuning by incorporating potential terms into prompts to enhance terminology generation accuracy (Lakomkin et al. 2024; Gong et al. 2024). ICL demon- strates notable efficacy in terminology intervention but ex- hibits high prompt sensitivity: accurate candidate terms can serve as references for SLMs, thereby enhancing the accu- racy of terminology generation. Consequently, the core chal- lenge lies in retrieving relevant terms. To address the retrieval challenge in speech scenarios, recent works such as Seal (Sun et al. 2025) adopt Vector DataBase (VectorDB) for terminology retrieval, inheriting the RAG framework (Lewis et al. 2020; Gao et al. 2023). However, unlike text-centric RAG methods, these solutions must incorporate speech-text modal alignment strategies. This adaptation is critical because the inherent modality gap between speech and text precludes direct application of con- arXiv:2508.18701v1 [cs.CL] 26 Aug 2025 ventional VectorDB techniques (Gong et al. 2025). However, VectorDB methods face significant issues: \u2022 High Training Cost: Training modality alignment mod- els for speech and text requires large-scale datasets and entails extended training durations. \u2022 Poor Retrieval Accuracy: VectorDB performs retrieval based on cosine similarity, but it\u2019s not equivalent to the probability of terms appearing in audio, resulting in sub- optimal recall rates. To address these limitations, we propose the Atten- tion2Probability (A2P) method. As shown in Figure 1, A2P completely eliminates the VectorDB used in prior ap- proaches, replacing it with a cross-attention mechanism. This mechanism computes attention weights between the speech input and candidate terms, converting these weights directly into the probability of each term\u2019s presence in the speech. Based on these probabilities, the Top-k most probable terms are selected to identify the terms most likely present in the speech. These terms are appended to the prompt, explicitly informing the SLM of likely relevant terms to guide accurate generation of the target-language terminol- ogy. Crucially, without requiring any dedicated modal align- ment training, A2P achieves high terminology recall accu- racy. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: \u2022 We depart from conventional VectorDB approaches by introducing a cross-attention mechanism for terminology retrieval, providing a new paradigm for future research in this domain. \u2022 We have constructed a dedicated speech recognition and translation terminological dataset by leveraging MegaTTS (Jiang et al. 2025) and open-source terminol- ogy translation data, and will publicly release it. \u2022 Our proposed A2P framework achieves high terminology recall accuracy. \u2022 We critically examine limitations in current methods, laying a foundation for further exploration",

Related work Textual Terminology Translation For traditional machine translation tasks, achieving termi- nology translation typically involves two approaches: con- strained generation and data augmentation. Constrained generation methods enforce the model to generate target ter- minology during the inference stage through a series of con- straint mechanisms (Hokamp and Liu 2017; Post and Vilar 2018; Hasler et al. 2018). For instance, during beam search, score rewards are assigned to translation candidates contain- ing terminology to boost the ranking of terminology-related candidates. The data augmentation schemes are further divided into two types: Placeholder and Code-Switch. The Placeholder method replaces terms in the source text with special tokens, and then replaces these special tokens with target terms after translation (Dinu et al. 2019; Bergmanis and Pinnis 2021). Code-Switch method doesn\u2019t use special tokens; instead, it directly replaces source-language terms with target terms (Crego et al. 2016; Michon, Crego, and Senellart 2020). These methods can effectively improve the terminol- ogy generation accuracy in textual terminology translation. However, they are not applicable to speech: constrained gen- eration methods are time-consuming (Beurer-Kellner, Fis- cher, and Vechev 2024), while data augmentation methods are difficult to implement due to modal differences. Speech Tasks with Terminology Intervention A common paradigm for speech tasks with terminology in- tervention involves three steps: first training for modal align- ment, then retrieving terms via VectorDB, and finally adding the terms to prompts to intervene in SLM generation (Yang et al. 2024; Feng et al. 2025). The differences lie in the methods for modal alignment. For instance, Seal adopts con- trastive learning (Sun et al. 2025), while BR-ASR (Gong et al. 2025) uses CLAP (Elizalde et al. 2023). A few works don\u2019t follow this paradigm; Locate-and-Focus retrieves au- dio frames containing terms via semantic similarity, then performs replacement using Code-Switch-like techniques and additionally adds special tokens (Wu et al. 2025). These methods share the commonality of retrieving terms based on semantic similarity, which is simple and feasible. However, due to the rigor of terminology, we require every character to be completely accurate. Yet, semantic similar- ity methods tend to recall words semantically similar to the real terms, which is not the result we expect. Furthermore, all the aforementioned works are tested on general-domain datasets, which differ significantly from real-world termi- nology scenarios. Therefore, our proposed A2P method di- rectly calculates the probability of term occurrence instead of relying on semantic similarity,",

Furthermore, all the aforementioned works are tested on general-domain datasets, which differ significantly from real-world termi- nology scenarios. Therefore, our proposed A2P method di- rectly calculates the probability of term occurrence instead of relying on semantic similarity, and avoids scenario differ- ences by training on terminology data. Method In this section, we commence with the formal problem for- mulation, followed by an introduction to the multi-modal feature extraction scheme. Subsequently, we detail the prin- ciples of the proposed A2P and its associated training loss function. We then elaborate on the curriculum learning strat- egy implemented during training. Finally, we delineate the operational workflow of the Retriever during inference. The overall architecture of the Retriever is shown in Fig. 2. Problem Formulation In terminology retriever tasks, we define the training data as Dtrain = {speech, src terms}, where src terms refers to the terminology in the same language as the speech. During inference, the data is defined as Dinfer = {speech, term bank}, where the term bank contains both src terms and their corresponding tgt terms. Our pro- posed A2P framework consists of four key stages: Multi- modal Feature Extraction, Cross-Modal Retriever Training, Curriculum learning, and Terminology-Augmented Infer- ence. Each stage will be introduced sequentially in the fol- lowing sections. Term Word Feature Speech Feature Cross-Attn Token-Level Pooling Linear & Sigmoid Figure 2: The overall architecture of the Retriever in the A2P method. Multi-modal Feature Extraction There exists a modality gap between raw speech signals and textual data. To address this gap, we seek to align speech and text features within a shared latent space. The multimodal model Qwen2-Audio-Instruction exhibits the capacity for joint comprehension of both speech and textual modalities, indicating that its feature space inherently encodes repre- sentations of both. Accordingly, we utilize the audio en- coder from Qwen2-Audio-Instruction to extract speech fea- tures, while textual inputs are directly processed via standard embedding layers. Our framework processes each modality through dedicated pathways: hs = f audio \u03b8 (speech) \u2208Rd (1) ht = gtext \u03d5 (src term) \u2208Rd (2) where f audio \u03b8 and gtext \u03d5 represents the parameter of Qwen2- Audio-Instruction\u2019s audio-encoder and embedding mod- ule. d-dimensional is the embedding dimension of Qwen2- Audio-Instruction. f audio \u03b8 and gtext \u03d5 are kept frozen during training. Cross-Modal Retriever Training Inspired by advancements in the field of speech tasks with terminology intervention, we propose a speech retriever ar- chitecture. Using a cross-attention mechanism, our model computes the attention weights between speech signals and different candidate terms. These attention weights directly indicate the probability of each term\u2019s presence in the speech. The specific formula is as follows: Sattn =",
    "tasks with terminology intervention, we propose a speech retriever ar- chitecture. Using a cross-attention mechanism, our model computes the attention weights between speech signals and different candidate terms. These attention weights directly indicate the probability of each term\u2019s presence in the speech. The specific formula is as follows: Sattn = MHA(hs, ht) (3) where MHA is the multi-head cross attention, hs and ht are the feature of speech and terms. While we have obtained attention weights between terms and speech signals, these weights remain inherently token- level due to the initial term processing through a tokenizer. However, our optimization objective requires computing the SARS COV 2 speech speech SARS-COV-2 Figure 3: Schematic of token-level pooling. For example, a multi-word term like \u201dSARS-COV-2\u201d is tokenized by the to- kenizer into subword units. Token-level pooling aggregates these subword representations, thus preserving the term\u2019s se- mantic integrity and allowing the retriever to focus on the holistic information of the term. probability of term occurrence in the speech, which necessi- tates aggregating term-level information beyond token-level representations. To address this, we propose an effective pooling method: sum the token-level weights to obtain the overall attention weight of the speech towards terms. To ensure the stability of subsequent training, we normalize the attention weight based on the lengths of the speech and term, as illustrated in Figure 3. The specific formula is as follows: Smasked = Sattn \u2299Mspeech \u2299Mtext (4) Ssum = L X i=1 Smasked[i] (5) Msum = L X i=1 Mtext (6) Spooled = Ssum Msum + \u03f5 (7) where Mspeech and Mtext respectively represent the mask matrices of speech features and text features, and \u03f5 is a min- imal number used to avoid the situation where the denomi- nator is zero. First, we extract the relevant signals using mask matrices to eliminate irrelevant positions in Eq. 4. Subsequently, sum- mation along the term-length dimension utilizes the actual term length to prevent gradient instability caused by high- dimensional interactions, where division by the term length serves as dimensional reduction regularization. This design explicitly converts fine-grained token correlations into ro- bust term-level representations while maintaining numerical stability throughout the training process. In the end, we im- plement a residual connection (He et al. 2016) to preserve original semantic information. Sfinal = ht + Spooled (8) \u02c6y = \u03c3(Linear(Sfinal)) (9) To address data scarcity in speech-to-text tasks with ter- minology intervention, we calculate the loss of positive and negative samples simultaneously. This helps the model learn to recognize terms present in the speech while distinguishing absent terms, thereby improving retrieval robustness. The formalized loss function combines dual objectives: L = E(s, t+)[\u2212log \u02c6y+] | {z } Positive term maximization + E(s, t\u2212)[\u2212log(1 \u2212\u02c6y\u2212)] | {z",
    "of positive and negative samples simultaneously. This helps the model learn to recognize terms present in the speech while distinguishing absent terms, thereby improving retrieval robustness. The formalized loss function combines dual objectives: L = E(s, t+)[\u2212log \u02c6y+] | {z } Positive term maximization + E(s, t\u2212)[\u2212log(1 \u2212\u02c6y\u2212)] | {z } Negative term minimization (10) Where \u02c6y+/t+ denote positive samples (term present in speech) and \u02c6y\u2212/t\u2212represent negative samples (term absent). Curriculum Learning Due to the highly heterogeneous length distribution of real- world terms, a retriever without well-initialized parameters struggles to effectively learn both short and long terms si- multaneously. To tackle this training challenge, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy (Bengio et al. 2009; Wang, Chen, and Zhu 2021), by organizing the training process into three successive stages: \u2022 Word-level: In this stage, terms within the training data consist of randomly selected individual words from the text. The fine-grained nature and uniform length of these terms significantly reduce the learning difficulty of A2P, facilitating initial parameter estimation. \u2022 Phrase-Level: Building upon the acquired ability to de- tect fine-grained terms, this stage utilizes randomly se- lected sequences of 1 to 4 consecutive words within the text as terms. The objective is to progressively enhance the A2P sensitivity in terms of varying lengths. \u2022 Real-Term Level: Following the preceding stages, the retriever possesses well-initialized parameters. Conse- quently, this final stage employs authentic terms for train- ing, ensuring robust recall capability under real-world conditions. Terminology-Augmented Inference During deployment, the trained retriever performs efficient cross-modal matching between input speech and a prede- fined terminology bank term bank = tm i=1 containing m terms. The retrieval process is formalized as: p(ti|speech) = \u03c3(\u03c8\u03b8(speech, ti)), \u2200i \u2208[0, m] (11) K = argtopk 1\u2264i\u2264m (p(ti|speech)) (12) Tretrieved = term bank[k], \u2200k \u2208K (13) where \u03c8\u03b8 represents the retriever parameters, Eq. 11 is used to compute the presence probability of terms from the termi- nology base within the speech, utilizing the Retriever. These terms are then ranked by descending probability, and the in- dices of the Top-K terms are retrieved. These indices query the terminology base to obtain the candidate term set. Upon retrieving candidate terms Tretrieved, we spell them into the prompt and inject this knowledge by leveraging the ICL capabilities of LLM.

Experiments Dataset To date, there are no open-source datasets for speech-to-text tasks with terminology intervention. Even datasets for tex- tual terminology translation are extremely scarce. Therefore, we devise an alternative strategy: We repurpose entities from Named Entity Recognition (NER) datasets as terms, and then utilize MegaTTS to gen- erate corresponding speech for their textual definitions. As shown in Table 1, we collect data from both Chinese and English, and also evaluate the performance of these two lan- guage directions in subsequent tasks. Such as Wikiann (Pan et al. 2017), MSRA-NER (Levow 2006), Few-nerd (Ding et al. 2021) and CMeEE (Du, Jia, and Zan 2022). Given the limited data volume achievable via the first strategy, we further augment our data by leveraging the Lib- riSpeech (Panayotov et al. 2015) and Aishell-2 (Du et al. 2018) datasets, designating certain words or phrases within their utterances as terms. This approach enables the cost- effective acquisition of large-scale data. To evaluate model performance, we utilize the Chinese- English terminology translation test set from the ma- chine translation dataset ComMT (Luo et al. 2025). This high-confidence dataset comprises carefully curated terms sourced from authoritative benchmarks, including WMT and DAS, with domain coverage concentrated in news and medicine. Consistent with the prior experimental configura- tion, we also synthesize bidirectional speech corpora using MegaTTS. Experimental setups Pre-processing For speech data, LibriSpeech has a sam- pling rate of 16 kHz, while other TTS-generated speech data use a sampling rate of 24 kHz. During speech loading, all data is uniformly resampled to 16 kHz. For terminology data, the word-level terms in LibriSpeech are sourced from the all rare subset in Rare5k (Le et al. 2021), while phrase- level terms are constructed by randomly selecting text spans from utterances. For Aishell-2, words or phrases are ran- domly selected to facilitate both word-level and phrase-level training. Terms in TTS-generated data correspond to entity names from the original NER datasets. All data undergoes feature extraction strictly following the default configuration of Qwen2-Audio-Instruction, with the original vocabulary retained without modification. Model Setting We employ the Qwen2-Audio-Instruction model as our SLM. The instruction-tuned variant is selected because terms are dynamically incorporated into the prompt, necessitating robust instruction-following capabilities, par- ticularly in handling dynamically constructed prompts. For the audio encoder, we utilize the",

The instruction-tuned variant is selected because terms are dynamically incorporated into the prompt, necessitating robust instruction-following capabilities, par- ticularly in handling dynamically constructed prompts. For the audio encoder, we utilize the pretrained weights from Qwen2-Audio-Instruction. To ensure compatibility with the encoder, the hidden dimension of the cross-attention re- triever is accordingly set to 4096. The Retriever employs only a single-layer cross-attention mechanism, with the multi-head attention configured with 32 heads and a dropout rate of 0.1. Retriever Training and Inference During training, the batch size is set to 32, with a maximum term bank capac- ity of 100 terms per batch. We train with a maximum of 50 epochs and a learning rate of 1e-4. The initial learning rate is 1e-7, accompanied by 500 warmup steps. The CosineAn- nealingLR scheduler is adopted for learning rate decay. Op- timization used AdamW with hyperparameters \u03b21=0.9, \u03b22= 0.98, and weight decay = 0.01. During inference, the Retriever operates on a terminology bank comprising all 583 terms from the test set. All models are trained on 8 Nvidia Tesla A100-80G GPUs. We imple- ment our models based on the Accelerator. Instruction Fine-Tuning When intervening in ASR and ST tasks with terminology, robust instruction-following capabilities become essential for the SLM due to the added terminology. To ensure effective terminology utiliza- tion, we perform instruction fine-tuning on Qwen2-Audio- Instruction. The Niutrans1 dataset from Table 1, containing parallel English-Chinese corpora, is used for fine-tuning. To enhance the SLM\u2019s instruction adherence, ASR and ST tasks are ran- domly interleaved during training. Furthermore, terminol- ogy presentation is randomly assigned to four conditions: no terminology, entirely correct terminology, entirely incorrect terminology, and partially correct terminology. We use the LlamaFactory toolkit for training, with 3 epochs and a learning rate of 2e-6 (Zheng et al. 2024). We employ full fine-tuning within the DeepSpeed framework (Rajbhandari et al. 2020), setting the stage parameter to 3. Baseline Systems To validate the effectiveness of our ap- proach, we conduct comparative experiments against a con- 1challenge.xfyun.cn/topic/info?type=machine-translation-2024 ventional VectorDB solution. The Chroma VectorDB is em- ployed, utilizing cosine similarity for distance computation, with the SONAR modality alignment model selected as the SOTA open-source baseline. We adopt the HNSW algorithm for indexing, while other parameters are configured using Chroma\u2019s default settings. To further investigate the impact of the audio en- coder on Retriever performance, we evaluate three alterna- tive encoders: Qwen-Audio-Chat and SONAR.

Notably, as SONAR inherently outputs dense embeddings, pooling op- erations are omitted for the specific encoder. Results and Analysis In this section, we will first present the recall rate of Re- triever under different Settings and analyze the performance differences between A2P and VectorDB. Next, we will ana- lyze the impact of curriculum learning on the Retriever. Af- ter that, we analyze what effects different Audio-Encoders have on the Retriever and analyze the reasons. Then, we will analyze the changes in recall performance and recall speed under different sizes of terminology databases. Last but not least, the changes in LLM performance before and after using recall terms to intervene in speech recognition and speech translation will be demonstrated. Main Results of the A2P Method Table 2 presents the recall rates of various approaches un- der multiple conditions. It is observable that the A2P ap- proach achieves high terminology recall accuracy with spe- cific audio encoders, surpassing the VectorDB method by a substantial margin. A2P exhibits an absolute performance advantage, particularly when retrieving fewer terms. We conduct an analysis to understand this phenomenon, revealing an intriguing insight: the VectorDB method funda- mentally doesn\u2019t perform retrieval; instead, it identifies se- mantically similar vectors within the embedding space. Core Limitation of VectorDB Approach The VectorDB finds the term vectors closest to the speech vector using co- sine similarity. The similarity between terms and speech in the semantic space does not equal the probability of the term occurrence in the speech. This occurs because com- pressing the audio into a single vector makes the seman- tic information highly concentrated. As a result, during re- trieval, the VectorDB often recalls terms that are semanti- cally relevant but not present in the original audio. Advantages of of A2P The A2P method is explicitly op- timized to detect terms that are present within the speech signal. This optimization objective results in retrieved terms having a significantly higher probability of actual occur- rence in the speech. The Impact of Audio-Encoder Further Analysis from Table 2: A pronounced performance discrepancy is observed across different audio encoders.

We attribute this limitation to SONAR extraction of ultra- high-dimensional features, which exceeds the modeling ca- pacity of our lightweight A2P architecture (80M parame- ters). Scaling the Retriever to parameter magnitudes com- parable to SeamlessM4T (e.g., billion-scale) might enable effective utilization of SONAR feature representations. Qwen-Audio-Chat exhibits disparate performance: it ap- proaches VectorDB performance on Chinese but underper- forms on English. We hypothesize this stems primarily from imbalances in its training data, likely reflecting greater Chi- nese data abundance during training. These findings ad- dress the question posed in the Introduction. Firstly, modal- ity alignment proves critical for cross-modal retrieval, di- rectly impacting performance. Secondly, some SLMs in- herently possess this alignment capability without requiring dedicated training. The existing Qwen2-Audio-Instruction model already demonstrates strong inherent alignment. Different Sizes of Terminology Databases Speed Table 3 presents the average retrieval time per query for both methods. The VectorDB solution consistently outperforms the A2P approach across all tested terminology database scales. Further analysis of A2P\u2019s latency reveals that approximately 60% of the processing time is consumed by the Top-k selection algorithm. Top-k operation, with its O(N log K) time complexity, represents the primary com- putational bottleneck in the A2P pipeline. Furthermore, it can be clearly observed from Table 3 that the latency of A2P increases with the expansion of the vo- cabulary size, which is attributed to the increased compu- tational load. By contrast, the retrieval speed of VectorDB remains consistently stable. Moreover, we argue that the re- trieval speed can be further enhanced by adopting more ef- ficient indexing methods (e.g., GPU-optimized indexes), a performance that A2P cannot match. 1 2 3 4 50 60 70 80 90 100 Recall / % A2P-ZH A2P-EN VectorDB-ZH VectorDB-EN Figure 4: The trend of the recall rate when k=50 as the ter- minology database size increases is shown below.

Recall Within the same language, A2P consistently out- performs the VectorDB approach across all metrics, as shown in Fig. 4. Furthermore, while A2P maintains robust performance on Chinese, it exhibits a more pronounced de- cline on English. We attribute this divergence to fundamen- tal differences in language typology. The typological distinction between Chinese (an isolating language) and English (a fusional language) leads to dras- tically different semantic representations (Wiltschko 2008). This manifests in terminology retrieval: terms phonetically similar to English roots or affixes are highly susceptible to false recalls. As the database grows, such false recalls be- come more prevalent, consequently causing significant per- formance degradation in English. Ablation Study Table 4 presents an ablation study on the impact of curricu- lum learning stages on the A2P final performance. Key ob- servations are as follows: \u2022 Directly training the A2P on real-term datasets during the initial phase yields no measurable performance. \u2022 When trained solely at the word-level, the Retriever demonstrates limited recall capability.

These experiments indicate that authentic data constitutes the critical success factor for the Retriever, while word-level and phrase-level training primarily mitigate data scarcity limitations. Our generated audio corpus (\u223c100k samples) likely falls below the scaling law threshold required for op- timal Retriever performance. Consequently, a Curriculum Learning training pipeline may become unnecessary when sufficient authentic data is available. Furthermore, ablating the token-level pooling drastically reduced the overall recall of A2P to below 1%. We attribute this to inherent redundancy in token-level attention weights.

The simple linear structure struggles to capture the holistic semantics of terms from this complex information. The re- sult strongly validates the design rationale behind the A2P architecture. The Influence of A2P on ASR and ST Table 5 presents the performance changes for ASR and ST tasks after terminology intervention using Qwen2-Audio- Instruction. The A/B metric represents text quality versus terminology generation accuracy. For ASR, Character Error Rate (CER) is used for Chinese evaluation, and WER for English. For ST, BLEU scores are used for both languages. Terminology generation accuracy showed significant im- provement across both tasks. For ASR, accuracy increased by approximately 6% on average in English and 5% in Chi- nese. The improvement is more pronounced in ST tasks, with English-to-Chinese translation gaining about 12% and Chinese-to-English improving by 13%. While the intervention approach achieves strong perfor- mance in ASR, limitations remain in ST. Notably, interven- tion improves both BLEU scores and terminology accuracy in ST, yet the terminology accuracy remains unsatisfactory. The complexity of ST for SLM contributes to the terminol- ogy accuracy being significantly lower than the recall rates in ST. This indicates that many correctly retrieved terms are not effectively utilized by the SLM. However, these results also demonstrate the challenging nature of our proposed dataset for current SLMs. Furthermore, SLM performance doesn\u2019t strictly improve with increasing terminology volume. For example, increas- ing terms from 30 to 40 degraded performance in English ASR but improved it in Chinese ASR. We attribute this phe- nomenon primarily to limitations in the SLM\u2019s ICL capa- bilities. Insufficient ICL capabilities of SLM likely hinder maintaining ASR/ST performance when processing numer- ous terms. These findings reveal new challenges for speech-to-text tasks with terminology intervention. (1) How can terminology accuracy in ST tasks be effec- tively increased? (2) How can SLMs preserve baseline ASR/ST perfor- mance when handling multiple terms? Conclusion This paper first addresses the data scarcity issue in terminology-augmented ASR and ST tasks by generating a labeled dataset using open-source MT, NER data, and MegaTTS. The public release of this dataset is expected to significantly advance research in this domain. Subse- quently, to mitigate terminology retrieval accuracy limita- tions, we propose the A2P methodology, which effectively circumvents two critical constraints inherent in VectorDB approaches while achieving superior recall rates in exper- imental evaluations. Notwithstanding these advancements, A2P currently exhibits high latency compared to VectorDB in retrieval throughput. Crucially, we demonstrate that sys- tematic incorporation of retrieved terminology into SLM architectures significantly enhances terminology generation accuracy across both ASR and ST tasks.

    "Knowing or Guessing? Robust Medical Visual Question Answering via Joint Consistency and Contrastive Learning Songtao Jiang1,5, Yuxi Chen1, Sibo Song2, Yan Zhang1, Yeying Jin3, Yang Feng4, Jian Wu1,6, and Zuozhu Liu1,6(B) 1 Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China 2 Alibaba Group, Zhejiang, China 3 National University of Sinapore, Sinapore 4 Angelalign Technology Inc., Shanghai, China 5 ChohoTech Inc., Hangzhou, China 6 Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Medical Imaging Artificial Intelligence, Zhejiang, China Abstract. In high-stakes medical applications, consistent answering across diverse question phrasings is essential for reliable diagnosis. However, we reveal that current Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) ex- hibit concerning fragility in Medical Visual Question Answering, as their answers fluctuate significantly when faced with semantically equivalent rephrasings of medical questions. We attribute this to two limitations: (1) insufficient alignment of medical concepts, leading to divergent rea- soning patterns, and (2) hidden biases in training data that prioritize syntactic shortcuts over semantic understanding. To address these chal- lenges, we construct RoMed, a dataset built upon original VQA datasets containing 144k questions with variations spanning word-level, sentence- level, and semantic-level perturbations. When evaluating state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like LLaVA-Med on RoMed, we observe alarming perfor- mance drops (e.g., a 40% decline in Recall) compared to original VQA benchmarks, exposing critical robustness gaps. To bridge this gap, we propose Consistency and Contrastive Learning (CCL), which integrates two key components: (1) knowledge-anchored consistency learning, align- ing Med-VLMs with medical knowledge rather than shallow feature pat- terns, and (2) bias-aware contrastive learning, mitigating data-specific priors through discriminative representation refinement. CCL achieves SOTA performance on three popular VQA benchmarks and notably im- proves answer consistency by 50% on the challenging RoMed test set, demonstrating significantly enhanced robustness. Code will be released.

Through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on Med-VQA training sets, these models achieve strong performance on downstream tasks. However, as illustrated in Fig. 1, our preliminary tests reveal a critical limitation: When questions are perturbed with varying levels of modifications while preserving semantic equivalence, models often produce inconsistent answers.

    "preserving semantic equivalence, models often produce inconsistent answers. This inconsis- tency severely restricts their applicability in real-world clinical settings, where diverse and interactive query formulations are common. Moreover, it raises fun- damental concerns about current Med-VQA evaluation framework: Is the model truly knowing the answers, or is it merely memorizing response patterns and guessing correctly by chance? To investigate further, we augmented the diversity of the original training data by introducing word-level perturbations. As shown in Fig. 1, vanilla SFT with more varied training data provides only marginal improvements in robust- ness against perturbations, with performance still significantly deviating from the original evaluation results. This yields two key insights: (1) the lack of diver- sity in training data contributes to the inconsistency issue [?,12], and increasing diversity can mildly mitigate it [25]; and (2) the current SFT paradigm, with its single autoregressive objective, has inherent limitations, as increasing data diver- sity alone provides minimal robustness gains. These findings highlight the need for a more robust Med-VQA evaluation framework and training methodology. To address these challenges, we first construct the RoMed dataset as shown in Fig. 2, a new Med-VQA dataset encompassing training and testing sets across four major medical modalities: CT, MRI, X-Ray, and Pathology. For the training set, we enhance diversity by introducing multi-level perturbations at the word, sentence, and semantic levels, enriching the original Med-VQA training data. For the test set, we reconstruct a more comprehensive VQA benchmark based on mainstream Med-VQA datasets. Unlike traditional datasets [32, 30] that fo- cus solely on accuracy, we incorporate evaluation metrics such as the Coefficient of Variation (CV) and Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) to assess answer con- sistency, providing a more robust evaluation framework. Furthermore, we propose Joint Consistency and Contrastive Learning (CCL) to address the limitations of the current SFT paradigm.

Additionally, by treating perturbed questions as positive samples and using other questions in the same batch as negative samples, CCL guides the model to perform com- parative understanding by leveraging contrastive learning objective [15]. This dual-objective approach mitigates potential overfitting in the model\u2019s repre- sentations and significantly enhances its generalization capabilities, making it more robust and reliable for real-world clinical applications. Extensive experi- ments and analyses demonstrate that CCL not only significantly enhances Med- VQA performance but also markedly reduces MAD and CV, thereby improving model robustness. CCL achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) accuracy and robust- ness on widely-used benchmarks, including Rad-VQA [16], SLAKE [19], and PathVQA [8]. \u2018 \u2014lHead: 26.1% : me ark ' mM) [Necks 16%) $ i 1 ' \\ As Chest! 167%] | waren % : !

    "first describe the construction of the RoMed dataset, address- ing the lack of robustness evaluation in current Med-VQA systems. To tackle the limited generalization of vanilla SFT, we introduce our Joint Consistency and Contrastive Learning (CCL) framework, which optimizes Med-VLM repre- sentation learning by integrating consistency and contrastive objectives. 2.1 RoMed Datasets Construction Our study reveals that current Med-VQA systems often fail to answer seman- tically equivalent perturbed questions correctly (see Fig. 1), despite accurately answering the original questions. This suggests that the reported accuracy on existing Med-VQA benchmarks may not reliably reflect the true knowledge level of Med-VLMs. To address this limitation, we construct a more diverse and robust evaluation dataset for Med-VQA (see Fig. 3 a). First, we inte- grate widely used Med-VQA datasets, including Rad-VQA [16], SLAKE [19], and PathVQA [8], which cover various organs and modalities. Building on these datasets, we introduce perturbations at three levels: word-level, sentence-level, and semantic-level, using a medical multi-agent collaboration system. Specifi- cally, we leverage three models to generate high-quality perturbations, combining both general-purpose and domain-specific VLMs. For the medical multimodal agent, we employ HuatuoGPT-Vision-34B [5], a leading medical VLM, which provides domain-specific medical knowledge by generating captions for the given medical images. For the medical reasoning agent, we use HuatuoGPT-o1 [4], a single-modal LLM with advanced reasoning capabilities. This agent takes the captions and question-answer pairs as input to produce intermediate reasoning steps for sampling correct reasoning processes. Finally, we utilize GPT-4o as the general meta-agent, a state-of-the-art closed-source model, to integrate feedback from both the medical multimodal and reasoning agents, generating three lev- els of perturbed questions along with their corresponding answers. After this process, we validate the constructed questions by feeding them back to GPT- 4o, ensuring they align with the same medical knowledge as the original ques- tions and do not require additional knowledge beyond what is needed to answer the original questions correctly. Following this validation step, we construct the RoMed dataset, as shown in Fig. 2. Since perturbed questions are derived from the original ones, an ideal robust VLM should consistently answer all variants correctly within each question cluster. To quantify consistency, we introduce two metrics: Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD), defined as MAD = 1 N PN i=1 |xi \u2212\u00b5|, and Coefficient of Variation (CV), defined as CV = \u03c3 \u00b5 \u00d7 100%, where N is the number of questions in a cluster, xi is the model\u2019s answer to the i-th question, \u00b5 is the mean of the answers, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation. 2.2 Joint Consistency and Contrastive Learning Knowledge-Anchored Consistency Learning Let q denote the original question, tokenized into text tokens Tq.

    "the model\u2019s answer to the i-th question, \u00b5 is the mean of the answers, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation. 2.2 Joint Consistency and Contrastive Learning Knowledge-Anchored Consistency Learning Let q denote the original question, tokenized into text tokens Tq. The corresponding image I is encoded Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length 5 into visual tokens VI using a visual encoder (e.g., CLIP-ViT). The multimodal input X is formed by concatenating Tq and VI, i.e., X = [Tq; VI]. The input X is fed into the LLM backbone, generating outputs Y. The autoregressive loss Loriginal is computed as: Loriginal = \u2212PT t=1 log P(yt | y<t, X), where T is the out- put sequence length and yt is the token at position t. To enhance the alignment with medical knowledge, we perform consistency learning by introducing per- turbations at three levels: word-level, sentence-level, and semantic-level. These perturbations are constructed through multi-agent collaboration based on the original question. For each perturbed question qi (i \u2208{w, s, sem}), the perturbed input Xi = [Tqi; VI] is used to compute the total consistency loss: Lconsistency = Loriginal + X i\u2208{w,s,sem} \u2212 T X t=1 log P(yt | y<t, Xi) ! . Bias-Aware Contrastive Learning To eliminate bias in the training data and calibrate the model\u2019s representation, we employ contrastive learning as part of the CCL framework. Specifically, the original question q and its per- turbed versions at three levels (qw, qs, and qsem) are treated as positive sam- ples, while other questions in the same batch serve as negative samples. The hidden state embedding H for the original input is obtained by feeding the mul- timodal input X = [Tq; VI] into the LLM backbone and applying mean pooling: H = M(LLM(X)), where M(\u00b7) denotes the mean pooling operation. Similarly, for each perturbed question qp (with p \u2208{w, s, sem}), the corresponding hidden state embedding is H+ p = M(LLM([Tqp; VI])). The embeddings of unrelated questions in the batch are denoted as H\u2212 j . The contrastive loss Lctr is: Lctr = \u2212 X p\u2208{w,s,sem} log exp(sim(H, H+ p )/\u03c4) exp(sim(H, H+ p )/\u03c4) + PN j=1 exp(sim(H, H\u2212 j )/\u03c4) , where H\u2212 j represent the embedding of the j-th negative sample, sim(\u00b7, \u00b7) denote the cosine similarity, \u03c4 > 0 be a temperature hyperparameter, and N is the total number of negative samples. The overall loss is defined as L = Lctr+Lconsistency 2 . 3 Experiments Evaluation Datasets and Metrics. To validate the effectiveness of our pro- posed CCL in enhancing traditional VQA performance, we conducted experi- ments on mainstream Med-VQA datasets, including Rad-VQA [16], SLAKE [19], and PathVQA [8].

To validate the effectiveness of our pro- posed CCL in enhancing traditional VQA performance, we conducted experi- ments on mainstream Med-VQA datasets, including Rad-VQA [16], SLAKE [19], and PathVQA [8]. These datasets cover CT, MRI, Chest-Xray, and Pathology modalities, encompassing both open-ended (free-form answers) and closed-ended (yes/no) question settings. For open-ended questions, we used Recall as the eval- uation metric, while Accuracy was employed for closed-ended questions, consis- tent with prior research. Additionally, to assess the robustness of current Med- VLMs, we utilized our constructed RoMed dataset. Beyond Recall and Accuracy, 6 Songtao Jiang et al.

We compare our method with several strong baselines: (1) CLIP- based methods (e.g., PubMedCLIP [7]), which achieve SOTA performance but are limited by their reliance on candidate words for open-ended questions; (2) Medi- cal foundation models (e.g., BiomedGPT [30]), which leverage generative multi- modal pretraining but lack multi-turn dialogue capabilities due to their non-LLM architecture; (3) VLM-based models (e.g., LLaVA-Med, LLaVA-v1.5 [17, 21]), which excel in VQA accuracy and interactive dialogue but prioritize precision over robustness. In contrast, our CCL method offers a plug-and-play enhance- ment for medical models, seamlessly integrating with VLM-based approaches to provide multi-turn dialogue support, improved accuracy, and enhanced robust- ness, making it ideal for real-world clinical applications.

As shown in Tab. 1, our CCL method, when integrated with the top-performing LLaVA-Med [17], achieves SOTA performance across three benchmarks. Notably, it excels in challenging open-ended questions, demonstrating its effectiveness as a plug-and-play module for robust VQA in clinical settings. VQA Robustness Performance Comparison. We evaluated our approach on the RoMed VQA benchmark, which introduces variations to assess robustness under diverse clinical queries. As shown in Tab. 2, LLaVA-Med\u2019s accuracy drops significantly (e.g., RAD-VQA [16] recall decreases by nearly 50%). In contrast, with CCL, the model maintains high performance, reducing accuracy loss to within 20% (Fig. 4). This highlights the limitations of current VQA frameworks and underscores CCL\u2019s ability to enhance both performance and robustness for real-world applications. 3.1 Ablation and Analysis Ablation of Joint Learning.

This highlights the limitations of current VQA frameworks and underscores CCL\u2019s ability to enhance both performance and robustness for real-world applications. 3.1 Ablation and Analysis Ablation of Joint Learning. We conducted experiments to validate the com- plementary roles of consistency learning and contrastive learning in our method. As shown in Tab. 3, the absence of either loss leads to a performance degrada- tion. Contrastive learning plays a critical role in refining robust representations, while consistency learning ensures the model acquires knowledge across varied question formulations and establishes better alignment with medical knowledge. The combination of both components achieves the optimal performance. Can SFT Improve VQA Robustness? To verify that our performance im- provements are attributable to CCL rather than additional training data, we compared the performance of LLaVA-Med with CCL and vanilla SFT, both trained on the RoMed trainset. As shown in Fig. 5, vanilla SFT on a larger dataset fails to effectively enhance model robustness. This demonstrates the ef- fectiveness of CCL, which leverages consistency learning to acquire new knowl- edge while utilizing contrastive learning to refine representations. Representation Visualization Comparison. As shown in Fig. 4 (e) and (f), we observe that in vanilla LLaVA-Med, the embeddings of the three levels of variations and the original questions are widely separated, indicating that the representations fail to capture the shared features across different formulations. This sensitivity to perturbations could lead to misdiagnoses in real-world clinical applications with diverse query formulations. In contrast, with CCL, the model\u2019s 8 Songtao Jiang et al.

This makes it better suited for high-stakes clinical scenarios. Effect of Scaling Data. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method on larger- scale data, we expanded the original VQA questions by generating two additional variations per level (word-level, sentence-level, and semantic-level), resulting in a dataset twice the size of RoMed training data. This allowed us to explore the trade-off between performance and cost. As shown in Tab. 4, adding one variation per level significantly improves the model\u2019s VQA performance and robustness. However, doubling the dataset size yields only marginal gains. Considering the training time overhead, expanding by one variation per level enables the model to achieve strong generalization capabilities through CCL. 4 Conclusion This work reveals the fragility of Med-VLMs in providing consistent answers to semantically equivalent medical questions, attributing it to insufficient con- cept alignment and training data biases. To address these challenges, we con- Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length 9 struct RoMed, a dataset with diverse perturbations, and propose Consistency and Contrastive Learning (CCL), which enhances robustness by aligning models with medical knowledge and reducing biases, achieving state-of-the-art perfor- mance.

These rules are derived from extensive Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), which includes attack signatures and behavioral patterns obtained through automated tools and manual threat analysis, such as sandboxing. The CTI is then transformed into actionable rules for the IDS engine, enabling real-time detection and prevention. However, the constant evo- lution of cyber threats necessitates frequent rule updates, which delay deployment time and weaken overall security readiness. Recent advancements in agentic systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential for autonomous IDS rule generation with internal evaluation. We introduce FALCON, an autonomous agentic framework that generates deployable IDS rules from CTI data in real-time and evaluates them using built-in multi-phased validators. To demonstrate versatility, we target both network (Snort) and host-based (YARA) mediums and construct a comprehensive dataset of IDS rules with their corresponding CTIs. Our evaluations indicate FALCON excels in automatic rule generation, with an average of 95% accuracy val- idated by qualitative evaluation with 84% inter-rater agreement among multiple cybersecurity analysts across all metrics. These results underscore the feasibility and effectiveness of LLM-driven data mining for real-time cyber threat mitigation. Index Terms\u2014Cybersecurity, Intrusion Detection, Rule Gen- eration, Large Language Models, Agentic AI I. INTRODUCTION Every year, approximately 7 trillion intrusion attempts are made globally, with over 90% of breaches exploiting known vulnerabilities that are not patched in time [1]. Signature- based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are engineered to continuously monitor computer networks and hosts to search for signs of suspicious activity and enable real-time threat detection through a set of predefined rules. These IDS rules include signatures of malicious attacks along with behavioral information. Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts are responsible for developing these IDS rules through a structured threat analysis process. This process involves several phases, such as using automated tools for signature extraction, moni- toring threat behavior in controlled environments (sandboxes), and others. All findings during this monitoring phase are accumulated as Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) to support rule generation. The CTI is thoroughly examined to pinpoint ma- licious behaviors and create signatures for effortless detection and prevention, ultimately leading to the creation of final and actionable IDS rules. This signature-based IDS rule-generation process is consistent for both networks and hosts.

    "examined to pinpoint ma- licious behaviors and create signatures for effortless detection and prevention, ultimately leading to the creation of final and actionable IDS rules. This signature-based IDS rule-generation process is consistent for both networks and hosts. Despite their effectiveness, existing IDS rule generation process faces significant challenges with adapting to today\u2019s rapidly evolving cyber threat landscape. Attackers continu- ously adapt their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), resulting in a rapid increase in both the number of rules that match new attack signatures and behaviors [2]. Furthermore, existing rules become less effective. Any delay in addressing persisting threats can leave systems vulnerable, resulting in significant consequences, such as financial losses, operational disruptions, or compromised security. Hence, this evolution demands a continuous feed of new or updated rules to counter emerging threats. At the same time, the manual nature of rule creation significantly limits scalability as the volume and complexity of threats increase. Every day, large amount of CTI is produced, including sandbox output, behavioral logs, Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) such as signatures, hash val- ues, and others\u2013 making manual analysis time consuming [3]. In addition to scalability, modern IDS face a fundamental challenge of \u2018rule bloat\u2019. As threat variants evolve, each deviation often necessitates creation of a new rule. This leads to an unbounded expansion of the rule base, which strains the computational resources of IDS engines and degrades performance. For IDS to remain efficient, the generation of new rules must be balanced with the identification and reconciliation of existing ones. Therefore, while generating rules, security analysts are tasked not only with analyzing CTI for malicious behavior but also with mapping it to current rule sets\u2014either updating existing rules or deprecating outdated ones. This mapping process requires a significant expertise and introduces an additional layer of complexity into the workflow, increasing the risk of generating erroneous, redundant, or suboptimal rules. Furthermore, IDS platforms for network and host environments require fundamentally different rule formats tailored to the nature of observed threats.

Fig. 1: Overview of FALCON framework with Input and Output of a HIDS (YARA) use case. Here, a CTI is fed as input and it outputs a deployable IDS rule while considering existing deployed rules and an Analyst note for assistance and reasoning. based IDS tools like Snort focus on detecting and blocking malicious network traffic. In contrast, host systems based on the popular YARA (Yet Another Recursive Acronym) tool can detect anomalous system-level behavior, such as memory anomalies or registry changes, by matching to known textual or binary patterns. Comprehensive threat detection requires rules that align with the specific capabilities and limitations of each target platform (NIDS/HIDS), further complicating and slowing the manual rule generation process [4]. The absence of automated support limits the agility and accuracy of IDS, ultimately reducing the overall effectiveness of the system. Autonomous generation of IDS rules has been an active area of research due to the necessity to reduce the tremendous amount of manual effort required to develop efficient IDS rules. To address these challenges, we propose an Autonomous Intrusion Detection Rule Generation framework (FALCON). Our approach integrates with machine learning (ML)-based signature and behavior extraction from threat analysis reports [5], [6] by employing agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the entire rule-generation pipeline. Given a CTI input containing behavioral descriptions, threat signatures, or indicators of compromise (IoCs)\u2014FALCON autonomously identifies and generates deployable IDS rules tailored to net- work or host-based scenarios [refer to Fig. 1]. Additionally, it also incorporates rule retrieval and refinement capabilities. More specifically, it can automatically identify existing rules that are functionally similar to the target CTI and decide whether to update existing rules, or generate entirely new ones. This enables efficient rule reuse, facilitates adaptive learning, and minimizes rule database bloat\u2014ultimately enhancing IDS performance. All generated rules are subjected to internal automated validation to ensure deployment readiness and alignment toward a desired outcome. For example, without any ground truth, it is challenging to conclude whether the gen- erated IDS rule addresses all the functional requirements [7] corresponding to the CTI. Furthermore, for practical deploy- ment, the rule must match the efficiency of the signature-based IDS approach. Therefore, we introduce a novel multi-phase validation pipeline, including a CTI \u2013 Rule Semantic Scorer model. The validation pipeline ensures that generated rules are syntactically correct, semantically aligned, and performance- optimized for deployment referencing the original CTI.

As part of this work, we make the following contributions: \u2022 We introduce FALCON1, an autonomous IDS rule gener- ation framework that translates CTI input into actionable IDS rules for both Snort and YARA environments. \u2022 We propose a novel CTI-to-IDS Rule semantic similarity scoring model to quantify the logical or functional align- ment between threat intelligence and generated rules. \u2022 We demonstrate that FALCON can identify existing rules and decide whether to generate new rules or update and reuse current ones, supporting adaptive and efficient rule management. \u2022 We construct a publicly available, comprehensive dataset of CTIs and corresponding IDS rules to evaluate FAL- CON using quantitative metrics and qualitative expert validation, demonstrating high accuracy and consistency. 1FALCON Code & Dataset: github.com/shaswata09/falcon (fry / II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK To provide a foundation for our research, we present the necessary information relevant to this work in this section. A. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are security tools de- signed to monitor computer networks and host systems to detect signs of malicious or unauthorized activity. Due to the nature of observing mediums, IDS solutions generally fit into two categories: Network-based IDS (NIDS) and Host-based IDS (HIDS). NIDS inspects network traffic for malicious activity as data traverses the network. At the same time, HIDS operates on individual hosts or endpoints, observing system-level activity and detecting deviations from expected behavior. Likewise, IDS can also be categorized by detection techniques. Among various detection techniques, this work focuses on signature-based IDS, which detects threats by matching observed behavior against a database of known attack patterns. Signature-based systems are widely used due to their efficiency, low false-positive rate, and effectiveness in identifying previously encountered threats. Given their relevance to our research, we limit our focus to Snort for NIDS and YARA for HIDS as representative for each IDS. B. Use of Large Language Models in Cybersecurity Large Language Models (LLMs), a cornerstone of gener- ative AI, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in au- tomating complex text and code synthesis tasks. Built on the Transformer architectures [8] and trained on vast textual datasets, LLMs can understand context, reason over input, and produce coherent and human-like outputs. Contempo- rary LLMs excel in language translation, query answering, document summarization, code generation, and other tasks. Prominent examples of",

Built on the Transformer architectures [8] and trained on vast textual datasets, LLMs can understand context, reason over input, and produce coherent and human-like outputs. Contempo- rary LLMs excel in language translation, query answering, document summarization, code generation, and other tasks. Prominent examples of LLMs include OpenAI\u2019s GPT and Meta\u2019s Llama models, among others. In the cybersecurity domain, LLMs are increasingly employed to automate domain- specific operations\u2014ranging from pre-processing behavioral logs for information extraction [9], contextualizing threat intelligence [10], to generating security test cases [11], among others. While challenges remain around control, accuracy, and interpretability, LLMs are emerging as powerful tools for reducing manual effort and accelerating response time. C. Agentic AI for Autonomous Cyber-defense Recent advances in AI have led to the development of agen- tic AI systems where models exhibit goal-oriented behavior that generate outputs and autonomously reason, plan, evaluate, and refine their actions with minimal human supervision [12], making them particularly suitable for complex and dynamic tasks such as translating CTI [6] into actionable IDS rules, validate their relevance and syntax, and suggest performance optimizations. For example, early works by Fallahi et al. [13] employed learning-to-rank models for selecting effective YARA rules, these approaches lacked autonomy and evaluative depth. In code generation, this agentic paradigm enables AI systems to interpret description and autonomously generate initial code drafts, verify syntax [7], and iteratively improve them for performance or coverage in real-time [14], assisting human security analysts to maintain adequate security posture. For instance, recent efforts have employed LLMs to extract indicators from behavioral logs [9], [15], or contextualize threat information [10]. However, these are often one-shot generations with limited internal validation or optimization. The move toward agentic pipelines addresses this limitation by equipping models with reasoning chains and internal feedback loops, leading to more accurate and deployable IDS rules. This work builds upon this emerging direction by proposing an agentic, LLM-based framework for fully autonomous IDS rule generation with internal self-evaluation and feedback loops. Our system not only generates Snort or YARA rules from CTI but also integrates structured evaluation phases\u2014covering syntax verification, semantic alignment [16], and performance improvement [17], emulating a human analyst.

Threat or attack behaviors (B = B1, B2, ..., Bn) consist of dynamic patterns, including observed actions such as proto- col usage, file types, or combinations of signatures that charac- terize malicious operations. CTI, denoted as C = C1, C2, ..., Cn, encapsulates structured or unstructured knowledge that con- tains either intrusion signatures (S), malicious behaviors (B), or a combination of both. Hypotheses [Ci\u2229(Si\u222aBi) \u0338= \u2205]: We assume that the anoma- lous signatures (Si) and behaviors (Bi) are always accurately captured in Ci. This hypothesis is necessary because, if the CTI does not contain the necessary information required to generate IDS rules, FALCON will not be able to identify S and B to contextualize with existing IDS rules (Re). Problem Statement For a given set of CTI Ci, the task is to generate a relevant IDS rule Ri while considering existing rules Re. Hence, f can be considered as a function that translates C into R, where Ri \u2229Ci \u0338= \u2205, meaning Ri should correspond to Ci. Ri = f(Ci, Re) \u2200Ri \u2229Ci \u0338= \u2205 (1) IV. FALCON FRAMEWORK With a defined problem statement, in this section, we describe our FALCON framework in detail. We begin with the solution approach, followed by a detailed description of each internal system module and its functionality [refer to Fig. 2]. Finally, we describe the implementation and demonstrate how the modules interact through an example use-case to generate the corresponding IDS rule (Ri) from a given CTI (Ci). A. Solution Approach The FALCON framework [refer to Fig. 2] is divided into two phases for autonomous IDS rule generation and validation. \u2013 The Generation Phase initiates with an input CTI (Ci), which includes threat signatures (Si) and behaviors (Bi). Then, the existing deployed IDS rules (Re i) that are relevant to Ci are retrieved to provide better context for rule generation. After retrieval of the relevant Re i, the Rule Generator LLM Agent receives a generation instruction (I) along with Ci and Re i to generate an initial candidate rule (Ri). I contains data extraction methods and generation guidelines that are necessary for an LLM agent to perform. Ri is then sent to serial validators to assess its quality. If the rule fails to meet the required validation threshold (T ), it returns the feedback (Fi) to iteratively refine the rule by regenerating a new version (Ri+1). This loop continues until a candidate rule (Ri+n) satisfies all criteria (T ), ensuring a relevant",
    "serial validators to assess its quality. If the rule fails to meet the required validation threshold (T ), it returns the feedback (Fi) to iteratively refine the rule by regenerating a new version (Ri+1). This loop continues until a candidate rule (Ri+n) satisfies all criteria (T ), ensuring a relevant output (Ri). Iterative feedback loops allow incremental refinement [18] of Ri+1 to meet T . Finally, a cybersecurity analyst reviews and approves validated rules before deployment, ensuring compliance with organizational security requirements. The analyst can also provide feedback (F) and initiate re-generation. \u2013 The Validation Phase systematically evaluates the gener- ated rule (Ri) through a serial process involving syntac- tic, semantic, and performance validations. Initially, the rule undergoes a syntactic check to verify structural cor- rectness. If it passes, meaning that the rule is syntactically valid for compilation, then it moves on to semantic analy- sis. Semantic analysis assesses the logical consistency and functional alignment with the provided CTI. Once the rule passes the semantic evaluation, performance validation ensures operational effectiveness of Ri, including aspects such as mapping with existing IDS rules (Re i) for update, run-time efficiency, and detection reliability. At each stage, failure to meet validation threshold (T ) results in immediate feedback, allowing targeted improvements in the next iteration of rule generation.

FALCON System Modules To implement FALCON, we first discuss the system modules, which are Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) or C, Relevant IDS Rule Retriever, Generation Prompt, Rule Generator LLM Agent, Generated IDS Rule or (R), Validator Feedback or (F), Syntax Validator or Parser, Semantic Validator, Performance Validator, Cybersecurity Analyst, and Orchestration Agent. 1) Cyber Threat Inteligence (CTI) or C: CTI serves as the primary input to the FALCON framework. It contains observed threat information comprising signatures (S) and behaviors (B), such as IP addresses, hash values, IoCs, protocols, and others. This information, extracted from threat reports or logs, forms the semantic basis for rule generation. 2) Relevant IDS Rule Retriever: The IDS rule retriever is responsible for identifying existing deployed IDS rules (Re i) to provide more context to the Rule Generator LLM Agent while",

This information, extracted from threat reports or logs, forms the semantic basis for rule generation. 2) Relevant IDS Rule Retriever: The IDS rule retriever is responsible for identifying existing deployed IDS rules (Re i) to provide more context to the Rule Generator LLM Agent while generating new candidate rule (Ri). This retrieval allows the Rule Generator to decide whether generation of a new IDS rule is necessary or updating an existing rule is more efficient. 3) Generation Prompt: Generation Prompt refers to a com- bination of task-specific instructions (I), deployed relevant IDS rules (Re i), and any feedback (Fi) as an LLM prompt to provide the Rule Generator LLM Agent with information to develop Ri from Ci. It ensures that generated rules follow the correct syntax, consider threat context, and align with the target IDS platform (e.g., Snort or YARA). It may also con- Generated IDS Rule Or chest r at i on Agent Syntax Check Failed Validated IDS Rule Deployable IDS Rule Validation Request Validator Feedback Validation Request Passed Syntax Check Failed Analyst Feedback Passed Semantic Check Failed Performance Check Failed Performance Check Passed Validation Phase Generation Phase Generation Prompt IDS Engine Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Start End Cybersecurity Analyst Input CTI + Existing IDS Rules Rel evant I DS Rul e Ret r i ever I nput CTI + Exi st i ng I DS Rul es + Feedback Rul e Gener at or LLM Agent Syntax Validator or Parser CTI - Rul e Semant i c Scor er Semant i c Anal ysi s LLM Agent Semantic Validator Performance Validator LLM Agent Fig. 2: FALCON architecture diagram, divided into the Generation and Validation phases.

Validated rules are reviewed by a cybersecurity analyst prior to final deployment. tain format specifications, extraction and prioritization logic, optimization strategy, and examples for few-shot learning. 4) Rule Generator LLM Agent: An LLM agent is respon- sible for generating Ri based on (C), Re i, (I), and F. It is capable of comprehending any feedback, to iteratively refine Ri by understanding the context of F with respect to C. 5) Generated IDS Rule or R: Ri is the output of our FALCON framework. It is the transformation of a CTI (C) into an actionable IDS rule (R) while considering existing IDS rules (Re). The rule may be refined through iterations by validators until it passes all validation checks (T ). 6) Validator Feedback or F: The Validator Feedback (F) is a validation report from syntax, semantic, and performance validators",
    "CTI (C) into an actionable IDS rule (R) while considering existing IDS rules (Re). The rule may be refined through iterations by validators until it passes all validation checks (T ). 6) Validator Feedback or F: The Validator Feedback (F) is a validation report from syntax, semantic, and performance validators or cybersecurity analyst. It has two main purposes: to evaluate the generated rules against a defined threshold (T ) and to provide insights for improving future rule generations. Hence, F includes a numeric value for comparison with T and unstructured descriptive information to assist the Rule Generator LLM Agent and Cybersecurity Analyst. 7) Syntax Validator: Syntax validator or IDS rule parser verifies that the generated IDS rule conforms to the syntactic structure required by the target IDS engine. It checks the cor- rectness of rule components such as headers, conditions, and options. If syntax errors are found in generated IDS rule (C), a negative binary [True/False] feedback value accompanied by the error syntax is returned for regeneration. 8) Semantic Validator or Parser: The Semantic Validator ensures that the generated IDS rule (Ri) logically aligns with the CTI (Ci) by verifying whether the rule effectively captures threat indicators (S) and behaviors (B). This involves checking for the presence of essential CTI elements, such as protocols, payload signatures, and behavior patterns, and ensuring their consistency with the intended detection objective. Given the structural and representational disparity between CTI (natural language) and IDS rules (formal rule syntax), traditional comparison methods such as graph matching is not applicable. While LLMs can be used for this alignment assessment, their reliability is often limited due to issues like hallucination [19] and reduced effectiveness over long input contexts [20]. To address this problem, we developed a novel semantic similarity scoring model to quantify the logical correspondence between the CTI (C) and IDS rule (R). This approach is inspired from multi-modal models like OpenAI\u2019s CLIP, which quantify cross-modal similarity (e.g., image-text). Specifically, we im- plement a Bi-encoder architecture trained to embed both CTI and rule representations into a shared latent space for similarity computation. We describe the model architecture and training procedure in Section IV-C. The resulting similarity score is then fed into a Semantic Analysis LLM Agent, which uses this numerical input alongside structured prompts to detect logical inconsistencies in Ri. Sudarshan et al. [18] demonstrated that LLM agents guided by context quantification and tailored instructions exhibit improved reasoning and reliability, which we leverage here. 9) Performance Validator: The Performance Validator as- sesses the operational efficiency of the generated IDS rule (Ri) for a production environment. It ensures that the rule can effectively detect threats without introducing performance bottlenecks. For instance, while matching multiple threat signatures using",
    "improved reasoning and reliability, which we leverage here. 9) Performance Validator: The Performance Validator as- sesses the operational efficiency of the generated IDS rule (Ri) for a production environment. It ensures that the rule can effectively detect threats without introducing performance bottlenecks. For instance, while matching multiple threat signatures using sequential if-else statements is functional, identifying shared patterns and leveraging regular expressions is generally more efficient and scalable. Gao et al. [21] demonstrated that LLM agents can be adapted to evaluate such optimization criteria accurately. Additionally, there may be existing IDS rules that can address a zero-day threat with minimal update. Hence, the Performance Validator considers metrics such as execution speed, resource utilization, and rule re-usability with detection coverage. Rules exhibiting suboptimal performance, such as excessive processing latency, redundant logic or unnecessary addition, are rejected and returned for regeneration with a negative feedback (F). This process ensures that only high-performing and compatible with existing rules advance in the pipeline. 10) Cybersecurity Analyst: Serving as the final gatekeeper, the analyst manually reviews validates Ri for correctness, relevance, and safety. Consolidated feedback (F) from last iteration is returned as analyst note alongside Ri. An analyst can also initiate regeneration with new F. This human-in-the- loop element adds a critical layer of trust and accountability. 11) Orchestration Agent: The orchestration agent manages the interaction between separate modules and decision-making throughout. It tracks rule generation attempts, routes feedback, and enforces the threshold criteria (T ) to maintain iterative synchronization between generation-validation phases. C. FALCON CTI-Rule Semantic Scorer/Calculator A reliable mechanism is required to quantify the functional alignment between an IDS rule (Ri) with its corresponding CTI (Ci). Existing code similarity models, such as Code- BERT [22] or GraphCodeBERT [23], are primarily trained on general-purpose programming languages (e.g., Python, Java) and focus on structural or syntactic equivalence rather than the intent or logical behavior embedded in CTI and IDS rules. These models are therefore ill-suited for our task, as IDS rules (e.g., Snort or YARA) are domain-specific, compact, and follow a structured signature-based format rather than traditional code semantics. Moreover, traditional techniques such as ROUGE [24], BLEU [25], and others fail to capture the nuanced threat relationships between Ci and Ri. This is mainly due to significant variation in length and abstraction levels\u2014CTI inputs often contain verbose threat descriptions, whereas IDS rules are succinct and configuration-like. These differences create a representation mismatch that weakens the performance of traditional similarity metrics. To fill this gap, we developed a domain-specific semantic scoring model built using a bi-encoder architecture [refer to Figure 3]. This model independently encodes a CTI input (Ci) and an IDS rule (Ri) into fixed-length (768) vector embeddings. We then compute the cosine similarity between",

This model independently encodes a CTI input (Ci) and an IDS rule (Ri) into fixed-length (768) vector embeddings. We then compute the cosine similarity between these vectors to determine their semantic alignment. The choice of a bi-encoder over a cross-encoder is intentional: bi-encoders are compu- tationally efficient for retrieval tasks, scalable for semantic similarity assessment, better suited for limited training data and structured inputs like IDS rules that require fast inference with minimal memory overhead. Contrastive Fine-Tuning: We full fine-tune a bi-encoder model (all-mpnet-base-v2) using a contrastive learning ap- proach. The objective is to bring semantically aligned CTI\u2013IDS rule pairs closer in the embedding space while pushing unrelated pairs apart. Given a batch of N CTI\u2013rule pairs (C1, R1), (C2, R2), . . . , (CN, RN), we encode each Ci and Ri to obtain embeddings eCi and eRi, respectively. The cosine similarity is then computed for each pair: cos(Ci, Rj) = eCi \u00b7 eRj \u2225eCi\u2225\u2225eRj\u2225 (2) where eCi and eRj are the vector representations of CTI and rule respectively, obtained from the bi-encoder. We apply a softmax over the similarity scores within the batch and minimize the cross-entropy (InfoNCE / NT-Xent) loss to ensure that the model assigns the highest similarity to the correct (principal diagonal) pair [26]: Lcontrastive = \u2212 n X i=1 log exp(cos(eCi, eRi)/\u03c4) Pn j=1 exp(cos(eCi, eRj)/\u03c4) (3) where \u03c4 is a temperature hyperparameter that controls the sharpness of the distribution. This formulation not only enforces alignment between relevant CTI\u2013Rule pairs but also helps the model distinguish between subtle variations across rule formats and detection intents. The model is integrated into Relevant IDS Rule Retriever and Semantic Validator module of the FALCON framework, where it provides numeric similarity scores to guide retrieval and validation. This approach ensures a lightweight yet effective semantic alignment mechanism, bridging the representational gap between high-level threat descriptions and low-level rule specifications to distinguish aligned CTI\u2013rule pairs, where it evaluates based on their semantic similarity by quantifying with Sigmoid [0-1] scale. D. FALCON Implementation and Module Interaction To demonstrate how FALCON works in practice, we walk through a concise YARA generation example use-case from CTI input (C) to finalized YARA rule (R) through validation. 1) CTI Ingestion and Rule Generation: The process begins when a CTI input (Ci) is provided. This input includes extracted signatures (Si) such as IP addresses, domain names, protocols, and behavior descriptors (Bi) from threat analysis reports. For example, a CTI sample may describe a mal- ware sample with known headers and known behavior. The Relevant IDS Rule Retriever then retrieves any",
    "input (Ci) is provided. This input includes extracted signatures (Si) such as IP addresses, domain names, protocols, and behavior descriptors (Bi) from threat analysis reports. For example, a CTI sample may describe a mal- ware sample with known headers and known behavior. The Relevant IDS Rule Retriever then retrieves any semantically similar rules (Re i) through semantic scorer model and a pre- defined filtration threshold. The Generation Prompt formulates a structured information tailored for the type of IDS rule to be generated (e.g., Snort, YARA) with I paired with Ci and Re i. It is then passed to the Rule Generator LLM Agent to output a candidate IDS rule (Ri). For space constraints, a complete Generation Prompt example containing I, Ci, and Re i could not be provided. Instead, we only provide the necessary information required for the reader\u2019s understanding. CTI & Rule Bi-Encoder Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) IDS Rule Pre-Training C1 . R1 C2 . R2 C3 .

Here, a bi-encoder model quantifies semantic similarity between C and R in [0-1] scale. Each Ci and Ri is independently encoded, and cosine similarity populate the matrix. During contrastive pre-training, correct (Ci.Ri) pairs (diagonal entries) are optimized for highest softmax score to capture logical alignment. At execution, the trained model efficiently scores new candidate IDS rule Ri for semantic consistency w.r.t. input CTI Ci.

This rule typically includes elements such as protocol, IP/domain match conditions, content matching patterns, and metadata. At this stage, the rule generation is complete but has not yet been validated for syntactic, semantic (functional), and operational (performance) efficiency. Therefore, Ri acts as a candidate that will pass through subsequent layers of automated and human analyst validation before final deployment. 3) Syntactic Validation: The generated rule is first sent to the Syntax Validator, which parses it to ensure structural and syntactic correctness. This includes checking for adherence to Snort or YARA syntax. If errors are detected, feedback is returned as Syntactic Validator Feedback (Fs) to initiate regeneration. In the following, we provide a sample Fs for both positive and negative use cases. Syntactic Validator Feedback (Fs) { \u2013status: True / False, \u2014-feedback: \u201cParser Output\u201d \u2013} 4) Semantic Validation: If (Ri) syntax is valid, then it proceeds to the Semantic Validator, where its alignment with the original CTI (Ci) is evaluated. This begins with the CTI- Rule Semantic Scorer [refer to Section IV-C], a bi-encoder model that quantifies the functional similarity between the CTI and IDS rule. The resulting score indicates how well the rule semantically captures the threat described in the CTI. This score is then passed to the Semantic Analysis LLM Agent, which analyzes Ri driven by the semantic score to identify persisting logical inconsistencies or gaps, such as missing indicators, incorrect protocols, or irrelevant payload patterns. If critical issues are found, the agent formulates targeted feedback (Ff) for the Rule Generator, prompting a revised generation cycle. This ensures semantic alignment with itera- tive refinement based on detailed contextual understanding. </> Semantic Validator Feedback (Ff) { \u2013score: \u201c\u20180.XX\u201d, \u2014-status: True / False, \u2014-feedback: \u2014- \u201c1.

The combination of LLM-driven generation, func- tional consistency check, and performance profiling alongside a static parser for syntax consistency, contrastively trained se- mantic retrieval, and scoring makes FALCON highly adaptable and efficient in producing high-quality IDS rules at scale. V. EXPERIMENT & EVALUATION In this section, we present the experiments conducted to validate our proposed FALCON framework. We designed three types of evaluation: training and assessing the performance of the CTI-Rule Semantic Scorer [Sec. V-B], evaluation of Rule Generator LLM Agent[Sec. V-C], and end-to-end qualitative validation of FALCON pipeline [Sec. V-D]. These experiments aim to validate that an autonomous agentic framework can generate syntactically correct, semantically accurate, and de- ployment optimized IDS rules by mining raw CTI data. A. Data Description and Experiment Setup To train and evaluate our CTI-Rule Semantic Scorer model and end-to-end FALCON pipeline, we collected 4017 Snort2 and 4587 YARA3 rules from open-source repositories and threat intelligence datasets. Two CTI instances were carefully generated for each rule, reflecting distinct but relevant threat behavior and signature descriptions. Additionally, we gener- ated a list of relevant but outdated rules for each rule to test out CTI-Rule Semantic Scorer as a retriever. This resulted in 8034 Snort and 9174 YARA CTI-Rule pairs and 15217 snort and 25875 YARA relevant but outdated rules for the retriever assessment. The CTI-Rule dataset was then split into 90% for training and 10% for testing (802 Snort and 916 YARA), ensuring balanced representation across both types of IDS rules. From the testing set, 60 Snort and 60 YARA were further set aside as a validation set for the overall pipeline\u2019s qualitative evaluation. Each rule in the validation set was categorized into one of three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, or Hard) based on complexity and length assessments performed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) which are cybersecurity analysts in our case. These CTI and obsolete yet relevant IDS rules were designed to simulate real-world",
    "Each rule in the validation set was categorized into one of three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, or Hard) based on complexity and length assessments performed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) which are cybersecurity analysts in our case. These CTI and obsolete yet relevant IDS rules were designed to simulate real-world use cases where FALCON must generate and validate rules from novel CTI inputs and existing deployed rules. To simulate diverse operational contexts, CTI was initially tested in both semi-structured natural language and structured STIX 2.0 [27] formats. Our preliminary observations indicated that semi-structured CTI led to more accurate generation of IDS rules (example in Section IV), and we standardized subsequent evaluations on similar predefined CTI format. However, the CTI schema remains flexible and can be adapted to existing cybersecurity requirements, such as STIX or others. The CTI-Rule Semantic Scorer models were fine-tuned over pre-trained embedding models using contrastive learning (details in Section IV-C) with a batch size of 64, learning rate of 2 \u00d7 10\u22125, and early stopping based on validation loss. This selection is intentional, as our findings with LLM embeddings were poor and inefficient. All training was performed on two NVIDIA H100 GPUs, and dataset, code, preliminary, and complete experimental results are reported in the repository1. B. Semantic Scorer Model Evaluation To evaluate CTI-Rule Semantic Scorer to measure semantic similarity between the CTI and IDS rules, we opt for a two- phase experiment [Table-II]. One is as a retriever, where the objective is to find existing relevant rules for retrieval, and the other is to measure semantic similarity between the generated rule w.r.t the input CTI. For the retriever evaluation, we used Recall@10 and Mean Average Precision (MAP) to assess the model\u2019s effectiveness in retrieving relevant IDS rules for a given CTI. In contrast, for the semantic similarity evaluation, we employed diagonal recall\u2014which checks if the similarity score along the principal diagonal (representing the generated 2Snort (Community): snort.org 3YARA: github.com/Yara-Rules/rules Pre-Training Evaluation Contrastive Fine-Tuning Post Fine-Tuning Evaluation Fig. 4: The diagram demonstrates the CTI\u2013Rule Semantic Scorer model\u2019s reliability to semantically map each CTI with its corresponding IDS rule, with the highest similarity scores (observed along the principal diagonal) on 10 validation samples. pair) is the highest in its row\u2014and a thresholded F1 score, where we determined the optimal similarity threshold post applying scaling function and evaluated the model\u2019s ability to distinguish matching from non-matching pairs.

Rule Generator LLM Agent Evaluation To assess the effectiveness of the Rule Generator LLM Agent in producing semantically meaningful IDS rules, we conducted a comparative evaluation across multiple LLMs of varying parameter sizes\u2014categorized as Large (L), Medium (M), and Small (S). The selected models include propitiatory GPT-4o and open source Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, Qwen3-32B, Mistral-Small-24B-Instruct-2501, Granite-3.3-8b-instruct, and Phi-4-mini-instruct, evaluated separately for Snort (NIDS) and YARA (HIDS) rule generation. The models were prompted with CTI inputs and tasked with generating complete IDS rules, which were then evaluated across three semantic sim- ilarity metrics: CTI-Rule Score (ours), RAGAS [28], and BERT-F1 Score. These metrics capture the logical consistency, semantic alignment, and lexical relevance of the generated rule w.r.t. input CTI and ground-truth rules. The results, summarized in Table III and IV, demonstrate that agentic LLMs can generate relevant IDS rules for deployment in resource-constrained scenarios.

To assess the quality of generated Snort and YARA rules, we utilized a Likert scale, with evaluations conducted independently by three cybersecurity Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).

Discussion The experimental results support our core hypothesis that Agentic LLMs can autonomously generate deployable IDS rules from CTI reports. Through the evaluation, we made several observations. (1) Even though the CTI-Rule model performed better compared to other retrievers, it is not a substantial improvement from an efficiency standpoint. Hence, we concluded that an ensemble (sparse + dense) retriever with ranking would be an efficient approach for retrieval tasks. As often, sparse (TF-IDF) works better due to data overlap. (2) Modern LLMs, regardless of size, are capable of mining relevant information from CTI and generating IDS rules, provided CTI contains all necessary information. (3) We observed that large and mid-sized LLMs often generated better results at first-shot generation, passing the validation. In contrast, smaller models, such as Mistral or Phi, often require 2\u20133 iterations to arrive at a valid rule due to errors in their initial outputs. This iterative refinement, triggered by feedback from the syntax validator, led to more accurate rules. This observation highlights that LLMs significantly benefit from structured, directed feedback loops, enabling them to converge toward higher-quality outputs. (4) The key finding emerged from our comparative evaluation of semantic similarity metrics: RAGAS tended to overestimate seman- tic similarity, while BERT-F1 underestimated it. In contrast, our CTI-Rule Semantic Scorer consistently captured logical consistency between CTI and generated rules in the right proportion.

In contrast, our CTI-Rule Semantic Scorer consistently captured logical consistency between CTI and generated rules in the right proportion. This was evidenced in all four evaluation graphs [Refer to Fig. 5] (Snort and YARA, generated IDS rule vs. input CTI and generated IDS rule vs. ground-truth IDS rule), where our model produced nearly identical trends (green line) across both comparisons. If the scorer were not truly grounded in logical similarity, the two graphs (1st to 3rd and 2nd to 4th) would diverge, as observed in RAGAS and BERT-F1. This consistency provides strong evidence that our semantic scorer is not merely matching surface-level lexical patterns, but is in fact representing logical relationships in latent space\u2014 a crucial step toward explainable, functionally meaningful evaluation of IDS rule generation. Moving forward, future work should not only refine the semantic similarity models and build more advanced validation agents capable of delivering nuanced feedback, but also expand to incorporate multi-modal CTI sources and integrate live threat feedback. This would enable continuous adaptation of the framework, supporting large-scale, real-time refinement of IDS rule bases, and further strengthening cyber-defense capabilities.

CONCLUSION In this paper, we presented FALCON, an agentic framework that leverages LLM-powered modules to automate the gener- ation and validation of IDS rules by mining CTI information. Addressing the critical challenge of rapid and accurate IDS rule development to address evolving cyber threats, FALCON streamlines the traditionally manual and error-prone rule en- gineering process. Through its modular pipeline, including a rule generator, syntactic\u2013semantic\u2013performance validators, and a novel semantic similarity scorer, FALCON ensures the correctness, relevance, and operational soundness of each rule before deployment. Our experiments on Snort and YARA datasets demonstrate the framework\u2019s robustness and adapt- ability, achieving strong agreement with human analysts while also revealing that logical relationships can be represented in latent space. Specifically, our CTI\u2013Rule Semantic Scorer consistently captured functional alignment across generated rules, CTI inputs, and ground-truth rules\u2014unlike conventional metrics such as RAGAS or BERT-F1\u2014providing evidence that explainable logic-aware evaluation is feasible in IDS contexts.

    "Tailored Teaching with Balanced Dif\ufb01culty: Elevating Reasoning in Multimodal Chain-of-Thought via Prompt Curriculum Xinglong Yang1*, Quan Feng2*, Zhongying Pan3, Xiang Chen1\u2020 Yu Tian4, Wentong Li1, Shuofei Qiao5, Yuxia Geng6, Xingyu Zhao1, Sheng-Jun Huang1\u2020, 1 MIIT Key Laboratory of Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, College of Computer Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics 2 Hunan Vanguard Group Corporation Co., Ltd. 3 Huaneng Information Technology Co., Ltd. 4 Tsinghua University 5 Zhejiang University 6 PowerChina Huadong Engineering Co., Ltd. {162110119yxl, xiang chen}@nuaa.edu.cn Abstract The effectiveness of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting is often limited by the use of randomly or man- ually selected examples. These examples fail to account for both model-speci\ufb01c knowledge distributions and the intrinsic complexity of the tasks, resulting in suboptimal and unsta- ble model performance. To address this, we propose a novel framework inspired by the pedagogical principle of \u201ctailored teaching with balanced dif\ufb01culty\u201d. We reframe prompt se- lection as a prompt curriculum design problem: construct- ing a well ordered set of training examples that align with the model\u2019s current capabilities. Our approach integrates two complementary signals: (1) model-perceived dif\ufb01culty, quan- ti\ufb01ed through prediction disagreement in an active learning setup, capturing what the model itself \ufb01nds challenging; and (2) intrinsic sample complexity, which measures the inher- ent dif\ufb01culty of each question\u2013image pair independently of any model. By jointly analyzing these signals, we develop a dif\ufb01culty-balanced sampling strategy that ensures the se- lected prompt examples are diverse across both dimensions. Extensive experiments conducted on \ufb01ve challenging bench- marks and multiple popular Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate that our method yields sub- stantial and consistent improvements and greatly reduces per- formance discrepancies caused by random sampling, provid- ing a principled and robust approach for enhancing multi- modal reasoning. Introduction Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) (Yin et al. 2024; Liu et al. 2023) have emerged prominent research focus alongside the rapid advancement of arti\ufb01cial intel- ligence. Built upon powerful foundation language models (Touvron et al. 2023; Bai et al. 2023), MLLMs leverage cross-modal alignment mechanisms to achieve understand- ing and processing of information across multiple modal- ities, including text, images, videos, and audio.

Figure 1: The simpli\ufb01ed \ufb02owchart of CAMS and its effects cal approach to deploying MLLMs is the in-context learn- ing paradigm (Brown et al. 2020; Xie and Min 2022), which drives models to perform predictions by providing a large number of instructions and input-output pair exam- ples.

    "a large number of instructions and input-output pair exam- ples. Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al. 2022; Zhou et al. 2022) enhances the logical reasoning capability of models by con- structing examples that decompose complex problems into step-by-step subproblems and solve them sequentially. Mul- timodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) (Zhang et al. 2023), on the other hand, further extends this core idea to the applica- tion scenarios of multimodal large language models, achiev- ing an improvement in cross-modal reasoning capabilities. MCoT encourages large language models to perform multi-step reasoning by providing explicit problem-solving rationales, rather than mapping questions directly to an- swers. This approach has been effectively applied to sci- enti\ufb01c question answering across domains such as natural sciences, linguistic sciences, and social sciences (Lu et al. 2022; Chen et al. 2024; Goyal et al. 2017; Marino et al. arXiv:2508.18673v1 [cs.CL] 26 Aug 2025 Llama3.2-vision:11b eee (b) | | | 80.

However, as illustrated in Fig- ure 2(a), MCoT prompt examples are typically randomly se- lected or manually crafted without considering the model\u2019s internal knowledge distribution or the characteristics of the dataset. This leads to prompts that are unstable and insuf- \ufb01ciently tailored to the model or task. As a result, MCoT prompting often suffers from poor generalization, halluci- nated outputs, and inconsistent performance. To enhance the speci\ufb01city and effectiveness of prompt examples, Auto-CoT (Zhang et al. 2022) constructs prompts by selecting repre- sentative examples via clustering, as shown in Figure 2(b). However, due to the inherent differences between modali- ties, the effectiveness of Auto-CoT in multimodal scenarios is limited. It fails to adequately account for the distributional differences in internal knowledge across different models. These challenges raise a critical question: how to selec- tively identify the most effective multimodal prompt exam- ples? In human learning, individuals often compile person- alized sets of challenging problems ranging from basic mis- understandings due to knowledge gaps to complex tasks that require multi-step reasoning. Inspired by the idiom \u201cTailor teaching to individual needs\u201d, we treat each multimodal large model as a unique learner and select prompt examples through two dimensions: uncertainty analysis and complex- ity evaluation.

Inspired by the idiom \u201cTailor teaching to individual needs\u201d, we treat each multimodal large model as a unique learner and select prompt examples through two dimensions: uncertainty analysis and complex- ity evaluation. We propose CAMS (Complexity-Guided Active Multi- modal CoT Sampling), a novel joint selection framework that integrates active learning and data complexity assess- ment. Rather than relying on randomly selected or manually crafted MCoT examples, CAMS constructs a tailored \u201cer- ror sets\u201d for each model based on the training sets of various reasoning tasks, aiming to enhance the models\u2019 performance on test sets. As shown in Figure 2(c), CAMS identi\ufb01es highly targeted, effective, and dif\ufb01culty-balanced prompt examples by jointly analyzing sample uncertainty and com- plexity. Figure 1(a) illustrates the core work\ufb02ow of CAMS, while Figure 1(b) highlights its perforamance advantages. We conduct experiments on \ufb01ve benchmark datasets and three multimodal large models. The results show that CAMS both improves model performance and greatly reduces accu- racy variability caused by random prompt selection. Our key contributions are as follows: \u2022 We introduce CAMS,the \ufb01rst framework to select prompt examples based on both model-internal knowledge and dataset characteristics. \u2022 We demonstrate that effective prompting requires a bal- ance of easy and hard examples; neither extreme is suf\ufb01- cient on its own. \u2022 CAMS greatly reduces the instability of traditional prompt selection methods and enables MLLMs to achieve stable, high performance on complex reasoning tasks. Related Work Prompt Selection based on Active Learning Active learning is a machine learning paradigm focused on maximizing model performance using the fewest possible labeled samples. It aims to identify the most informative un- labeled data points for annotation, thereby reducing label- ing costs while maintaining high accuracy. Active learning methods are typically grouped into the following three cate- gories based on how unlabeled data is queried: membership query synthesis (Angluin 1988; King et al. 2004), where the model generates new instances for labeling; stream- based selective sampling (Dagan and Engelson 1995; Kr- ishnamurthy 2002), where data points are evaluated one at a time for potential labeling; and pool-based sampling (Lewis 1995), where the model selects the most informative sam- ples from a large pool of unlabeled data. Active Prompt (Diao et al. 2023) applies active learning principles to prompt selection by quantifying uncertainty through prediction disagreement metrics (e.g., variance, en- tropy, disagreement) and choosing high-uncertainty samples as prompt examples. However, Active Prompt focuses solely on model\u2019s prediction disagreement with samples (i.e., dis- tributional differences in model-internal knowledge) without considering sample complexity. Our approach introduces a data complexity evaluator that assesses the inherent dif\ufb01- culty of samples.

This allows for more customized and effec- tive prompt selection, combining insights from both model knowledge and dataset characteristics. Chain-of-Thought in Visual Question Answering The Multimodal Chain of Thought (CoT) technique is widely adopted to enhance the multi-step reasoning abil- ities of large language models (LLMs). Its core idea is to guide models to generate intermediate reasoning steps that help them solve complex problems more ef- fectively. Benchmarks such as VQA (Antol et al. 2015), VQAv2 (Goyal et al. 2017), OK-VQA (Marino et al. 2019), A-OKVQA (Schwenk et al. 2022), and ScienceQA (Lu et al. 2022) provide structured visual question answer- ing (VQA) tasks across various domains, including natu- ral science, social science, semantics, and everyday rea- soning. For complex reasoning tasks, recent approaches like MCoT (Zhang et al. 2023), Auto-CoT (Zhang et al. 2022), Self-Consistency (Wang et al. 2022), and Active Prompt (Diao et al. 2023) leverage carefully designed prompt examples to improve model performance. Despite these advancements, many methods (Wei et al. 2022; Wang et al. 2022; Zhou et al. 2022) rely on either ran- domly selected or manually crafted prompt examples. These examples often fail to align with the speci\ufb01c demands of individual VQA tasks, limiting model performance. In par- ticular, they tend to overlook key factors such as the distri- butional characteristics of the model\u2019s internal knowledge and the multimodal nature of VQA tasks, focusing primar- ily on unimodal scenarios. To address these limitations, our framework jointly considers the model\u2019s uncertainty about the dataset and the intrinsic complexity of each example. By integrating both model-centric and data centric perspectives, we dynamically construct prompt examples that are better tailored to the model\u2019s current capabilities and the reason- ing requirements of the task, leading to more effective and adaptive prompting in visual question answering. Figure 2: Illustration of the motivation and key highlights of our proposed framework. (a) CoT uses random/manual prompts without analyzing model knowledge distribution or dataset features; (b) Auto-CoT uses clustering for representative prompts but ignores inter-model knowledge differences; (c) CAMS (Ours) screens optimal prompts via active learning uncertainty and complexity analysis, balancing dif\ufb01culty to enhance effectiveness. We adopt the same multimodal input consisting of images and questions as in (a) and (b) for CAMS. Methodology Figure 3 illustrates the three core modules of CAMS: (i) Analysis of Multimodal Model Internal Knowledge, which quanti\ufb01es the model\u2019s predictive uncertainty through multiple independent samplings of the model, revealing the distribution characteristics of the model\u2019s internal knowl- edge; (ii) Complexity-Based Dataset Feature Estimation, which is",

The goal of the prompt optimization task is to search for the optimal prompt p\u2217that maximizes the perfor- mance A(\u00b7) of large language models (LLMs) on a given task. This task can be formally de\ufb01ned as: p\u2217= argmax p\u2208Pspace N X i=1 S(A(xi, vi; p), yi) (1) where Pspace denotes the set of all possible prompts (auto- matically selected or manually crafted), and S represents the corresponding evaluation metric.

The \ufb01rst n/2 sets are classi\ufb01ed as dif\ufb01cult error-prone questions, while the subse- quent n/2 sets are de\ufb01ned as simple fundamental questions, resulting in a dif\ufb01culty-divided dataset: Ddiff train = {Ddifficulty, Deasy}, Ddifficulty = {Du1, Du2, . . . , Du+n/2,}, Deasy = {Du+n/2,+1, . . . , Dun}. (5) Complexity-Based Dataset Feature Estimation Evol Complexity. This is an evolution-based metric. We de\ufb01ne a small-scale seed dataset D = {(I(0) 1 , R(0) 1 ), (I(0) 2 , R(0) 2 ), ..., (I(0) N , R(0) N )}, where (I(0) i , R(0) i ) denotes instruction-response pairs. For each instruction sample I , we enhance its complexity through Technique F\u03b1(\u00b7), which involves adding constraints, speci- \ufb01cation, and increasing reasoning steps. After N iterations, a set of instructions with varying complexities is obtained: {(I(0) i , R(0) i ), (I(1) i , R(1) i ), ..., (I(M) i , R(M) i )} (6) where I(m) i = F\u03b1(I(m\u22121) i ) and N is set to 5. Further, we utilize the scoring function S(\u00b7) (i.e. ChatGPT) to rate and rank these 6 samples, generating a set of instructions with scoring labels: {(I(j) i , S(I(j) i ), R(j) i )}M j=0 (7) Composed of these labeled instruction groups, a dataset is constructed to train llava as the \ufb01nal complexity scorer. Textual Substitution for Visual Content. This scheme aims to convert images in multimodal data into text form (image captions) and integrate them with question texts to form unimodal inputs, enabling the reuse of existing uni- modal complexity scorers. Speci\ufb01cally, we \ufb01rst employ the ViT model (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020) to generate a corre- sponding text description (caption) for each image in the multimodal dataset. The image captions are then integrated with the corresponding questions and options to form com- plete unimodal inputs in pure text. We adopt the concatena- tion format of \u201cquestion text + option text + image caption\u201d, using the delimiter \u2032\\n\u2032 to ensure that the scorer can recog- nize the text representation of visual information. Finally, the integrated text data is fed into the complexity scorer, which outputs the corresponding sample complexity score.

To elaborate, we take n = 4 as ex- ample. Let the uncertainty metrics be u1 = 4, u2 = 3, u3 = 2, u4 = 1. The training sample set after categorization can be formalized as Dn train = {D4, D3, D2, D1}, where D4 and D3 are de\ufb01ned as dif\ufb01cult and error-prone question subsets owing to their high uncertainty metrics, while D2 and D1 are classi\ufb01ed as simple and fundamental question subsets due to their low uncertainty metrics. When selecting four training samples as prompt examples, one feasible strategy is to choose questions with the highest complexity scores from D4 and D2, paired with questions with the lowest com- plexity scores from D3 and D1. Alternatively, an inverse se- lection scheme can be adopted: selecting questions with the highest complexity scores from D3 and D1, and those with the lowest complexity scores from D4 and D2. Experiments In this section, we conduct extensive experiments to vali- date the effectiveness of CAMS (Complexity-Guided Ac- tive Multimodal CoT Sampling). Our experiments aim to address the following core questions: Q1. Compared with existing baseline methods, can CAMS improve the accuracy of \ufb01nal answers? Q2. Can CAMS eliminate the instability of randomly select- ing prompt examples? Q3. Are the designs of our two modules (active learning and complexity scoring) both meaningful? Q4. Can CAMS enhance the accuracy of multimodal large models in subdivided domains? Q5. Why should we select examples with uniform uncer- tainty for multimodal large models?

    "Q4. Can CAMS enhance the accuracy of multimodal large models in subdivided domains? Q5. Why should we select examples with uniform uncer- tainty for multimodal large models? Experimental Settings Datasets and Metrics. Following the standard evaluation settings in MLLMs reasoning research,we conduct testing on \ufb01ve popular benchmarks: ScienceQA (Lu et al. 2022), A- OKVQA (Schwenk et al. 2022), OK-VQA (Marino et al. 2019), VQAv2 (Goyal et al. 2017) and TextVQA (Singh et al. 2019). The problem designs in these datasets include both multiple-choice and open-ended answer formats, and we follow the practice (Liu et al. 2024; Li et al. 2024; Bai et al. 2023) of using accuracy as the metric. Baselines and Model Variants. In our experiment, the following \ufb01ve methods are used as the main baselines: Chain-of-thought (ZS-CoT) (Wei et al. 2022), Few shot CoT (FS-CoT), Self-consistency (Self-Con) (Wang et al. 2022), Auto-CoT (Zhang et al. 2022) and Active Prompt (Active- Pro) (Diao et al. 2023). FS-CoT uses the same annotation process as our method, the only difference being that it randomly selects questions from the training data for an- notation. We select multiple cutting-edge MLLMs as ex- perimental models, including llama3.2-vision:11b, llava:7b, and Qwen2.5-VL:7b. Figure 4: Accuracy \ufb02uctuations across \ufb01ve tests of FS-CoT and CAMS, where Test 1\u20135 denote the serial numbers of each test. Implementation Details Hyperparameters. For each dataset, we set the number of prompt examples to 4. In the training set sampling phase, we set the number of sampling iterations to 5. During both the sampling and the inference phases of the experiments, the temperature is uniformly set at 0.5. Unless otherwise speci\ufb01ed, the multimodal large language models used in the experiments are llama3.2-vision:11b, llava:7b, and Qwen2.5-VL:7b. Uncertainty Assessment. In the experimental process, we adopt a zero-shot sampling strategy, which does not rely on additional examples or guidance information. For Sci- enceQA, A-OKVQA, and VQA, we perform sampling on the complete training sample sets, while for the VQAv2 and TextVQA datasets, we only sample 10,000 samples. For the sampling frequency parameter, we set K = 5. We consis- tently use \u201cDisagreement\u201d1\u2014a more intuitive and accurate method\u2014as the uncertainty metric. Constructing Examples. We focus on the innovating and optimizating strategies for prompt example selection. To re- duce human labor as much as possible, we eliminate the need for manual annotation of prompt examples. Instead, we construct prompt instances by directly concatenating the question, reasoning, and answer from the dataset. Details are provided in Appendix A.

The best-performing FS-CoT is around 2 points 1In preliminary experiments, variance and entropy exhibit sub- optimal performance in multimodal scenarios. lower than CAMS. This indicates that CAMS can stably enhance the performance of multimodal large models on complex multimodal reasoning tasks, demonstrating robust effectiveness compared to existing baseline methods across diverse model con\ufb01gurations. For Q2: CAMS can greatly reduce accuracy instability caused by randomly selecting prompt examples. To en- sure the fairness and reliability of the experiments, \ufb01ve tests are conducted on the FS-CoT method using different ran- dom seeds on the test set, with the average accuracy across the \ufb01ve tests selected as the \ufb01nal result. Figure 4 illustrates the speci\ufb01c performance of FS-CoT in these \ufb01ve tests. The line chart reveals that the random selection strategy exhibits signi\ufb01cant instability, with substantial \ufb02uctuations in accu- racy across tests \u2014 the difference between the highest and lowest accuracy exceeds 5. CAMS not only signi\ufb01cantly re- duces the impact of randomness on performance but also consistently achieves above-average accuracy, outperform- ing the random selection strategy across the board.

Com- pared with the baseline method, both the standalone Unc- Eva module and Com-Eva module enhance model accuracy in complex reasoning tasks to varying degrees. The Unc- Eva module demonstrates better performance across differ- ent disciplinary types and dif\ufb01culty levels compared to the Com-Eva module. The Com-Eva module, while eliminating randomness, still improves model performance and ensures data stability and reliability. The experimental results indi- cate that the proposed method effectively combines the ad- vantages of both modules, further enhancing model accuracy while mitigating randomness. For Q4: CAMS can improve the model\u2019s accuracy in subdivided domains. To further investigate the ef\ufb01cacy of CAMS in speci\ufb01c sub\ufb01elds, we conduct systematic ex- periments on the ScienceQA dataset. Speci\ufb01cally, based on disciplinary attributes, the ScienceQA dataset is categorized into three major groups: natural sciences (NAT), social sci- ences (SOC), and linguistic sciences (LAN). According to dif\ufb01culty gradients, it is also divided into two levels: grades 1\u20136 (G1-6) and grades 7\u201312 (G7-12), thus constructing mul- tidimensional subscenarios that capture both domain speci- \ufb01city and cognitive complexity. As shown in Figure 6, in the \ufb01ve sub\ufb01elds mentioned above, CAMS almost universally outperforms the three baseline methods - Self-con, ZS-CoT, and FS-CoT - in terms of precision, especially in the NAT, SOC, and G1-6 domains. Whether in knowledge-centric sce- narios emphasizing disciplinary dimensions or in learning settings focused on dif\ufb01culty levels, CAMS demonstrates signi\ufb01cant advantages, con\ufb01rming its ability to substantially improve model accuracy within specialized domains.

    "disciplinary dimensions or in learning settings focused on dif\ufb01culty levels, CAMS demonstrates signi\ufb01cant advantages, con\ufb01rming its ability to substantially improve model accuracy within specialized domains. For Q5: A selection strategy that combines easy and dif- \ufb01cult examples is more bene\ufb01cial to the model. To eval- uate the effectiveness of combining easy and dif\ufb01cult exam- ples, we conducte additional experiments using two addi- tional selection strategies: one that includes only dif\ufb01cult ex- amples (i.e., those with high uncertainty) and another that in- cludes only easy examples (i.e., those with low uncertainty). As shown in Figure 6, while the all-dif\ufb01cult example strat- egy performs relatively well across the \ufb01ve target datasets, it still falls short compared to the balanced strategy employed by CAMS. This \ufb01nding highlights that relying exclusively on either high- or low-dif\ufb01culty samples is insuf\ufb01cient to capture the full spectrum of knowledge complexity and sce- nario diversity required for complex reasoning tasks. In con- trast, CAMS\u2019s approach of integrating both easy and dif\ufb01- cult examples enables the model to learn more diverse and representative knowledge patterns, ultimately leading to im- proved reasoning accuracy.

To overcome these limitations, we propose CAMS, a novel framework inspired by the pedagogical prin- ciple of \u201ctailored teaching with balanced dif\ufb01culty\u201d. CAMS integrates two key dimensions \u2014 model-perceived dif\ufb01culty and sample complexity \u2014 to construct a customized prompt curriculum that balances between easy and challenging ex- amples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CAMS through experiments on \ufb01ve benchmarks using multiple state-of- theart multimodal large language models. We also highlight promising directions for future work, including adapting CAMS to broader multimodal settings and further exploring dataset feature dimensions for deeper curriculum design.

    "Optimal Sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models for Reasoning Tasks Taishi Nakamura 1 2 Satoki Ishikawa 1 Masaki Kawamura 1 Takumi Okamoto 1 2 Daisuke Nohara 1 Jun Suzuki 3 2 4 Rio Yokota 1 2 Abstract Empirical scaling laws have driven the evolution of large language models (LLMs), yet their co- efficients shift whenever the model architecture or data pipeline changes. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, now standard in state-of-the-art systems, introduce a new sparsity dimension that current dense-model frontiers overlook. We in- vestigate how MoE sparsity influences two dis- tinct capability regimes: memorization and rea- soning. We train families of MoE Transformers that systematically vary total parameters, active parameters, and top-k routing while holding the compute budget fixed. For every model we record pre-training loss, downstream task loss, and task accuracy, allowing us to separate the train-test generalization gap from the loss-accuracy gap. Memorization benchmarks improve monotoni- cally with total parameters, mirroring training loss. By contrast, reasoning performance satu- rates and can even regress despite continued gains in both total parameters and training loss. Al- tering top-k alone has little effect when active parameters are constant, and classic hyperparam- eters such as learning rate and initialization mod- ulate the generalization gap in the same direc- tion as sparsity. Neither post-training reinforce- ment learning (GRPO) nor extra test-time com- pute rescues the reasoning deficit of overly sparse models.

Introduction The recent evolution of large language models (LLMs) has been driven by empirical scaling laws (Hestness et al., 2017) that link training loss to model size, dataset size, and com- pute budget. Kaplan et al. showed that these laws hold across seven orders of magnitude, establishing them as a reliable extrapolation tool for dense Transformers (Kaplan et al., 2020). Subsequent work by Hoffmann et al. demon- strated that scaling curves can be inverted to choose the compute-optimal combination of parameters and tokens for a fixed budget (Hoffmann et al., 2022). Together, these results have made scaling analysis a cornerstone of model planning at both academic and industrial labs. Yet the coefficients of the scaling laws are not universal. Highly expressive models trained under different optimiz- ers or architectures often follow the same loss trajectory but diverge substantially on downstream reasoning bench- marks (Liu et al., 2023). Brandfonbrener et al. extend the classic laws with loss-to-loss prediction, showing that the mapping between training and test distributions admits its own power law when the distributions differ substan-",
    "ers or architectures often follow the same loss trajectory but diverge substantially on downstream reasoning bench- marks (Liu et al., 2023). Brandfonbrener et al. extend the classic laws with loss-to-loss prediction, showing that the mapping between training and test distributions admits its own power law when the distributions differ substan- tially (Brandfonbrener et al., 2025). These observations imply that optimal budgets must be re-estimated whenever we modify the model or the data pipeline. A particularly compelling architectural modification is the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, offering high capacity at fixed FLOPs by routing each token through a sparse subset of experts (Shazeer et al., 2017; Lepikhin et al., 2021; Fedus et al., 2021). Modern flagship models, e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro (Gemini Team, 2025), DeepSeek-V3 (DeepSeek-AI, 2025b), and Qwen3 (Qwen Team, 2025) now rely on MoE as a de-facto standard for economical scaling. Abnar et al. derive a parameters-vs-FLOPs frontier and locate an optimal sparsity for a given compute budget (Abnar et al., 2025). These findings emphasize that the classical dense-model frontier is an incomplete picture, and one must account for architectural knobs such as MoE sparsity and top-k routing. Furthermore, loss-based scaling curves do not always pre- dict the performance on downstream tasks. Jelassi et al. report that increasing MoE sparsity improves memorization benchmarks, but saturates for reasoning performance (Je- lassi et al., 2025). However, the Mixture of Parrots paper (Je- 1 arXiv:2508.18672v1 [cs.LG] 26 Aug 2025 Optimal Sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models for Reasoning Tasks lassi et al., 2025) only explores the number of active vs. total parameters, ignoring the effect of routing strategies beyond standard top-2 routing. They also do not consider the effect of reinforcement learning and test-time compute on their reasoning benchmarks. Evaluating reasoning performance immediately after pre-training overlooks both the benefits of post-training adaptation and the leverage of additional test- time compute. Post-training methods such as GRPO, which use reinforcement signals to encourage coherent chain-of- thought generation, sharpen a model\u2019s reasoning on complex tasks (OpenAI, 2024b; DeepSeek-AI, 2025a). Beyond these refinements, models can further improve outputs at test time by adopting calibrated decoding strategies that mirror how humans pause to reconsider difficult problems. These test-time approaches not only boost routine benchmark per- formance but, when properly tuned, substantially enhance multi-step mathematical reasoning, demonstrating that adap- tive computing at test time is a powerful complement to both model scale and post-training adaptation. In this paper, we aim to identify how the optimal sparsity of MoE changes between memorization (TriviaQA, Hel- laSwag) and reasoning (GSM8K, GSM-Plus) tasks. In this work, we use the term dense models to refer to standard Transformers with a single feed-forward network per layer. For MoE models, we define sparsity as sparsity = 1\u2212Top-k Experts",
    "identify how the optimal sparsity of MoE changes between memorization (TriviaQA, Hel- laSwag) and reasoning (GSM8K, GSM-Plus) tasks. In this work, we use the term dense models to refer to standard Transformers with a single feed-forward network per layer. For MoE models, we define sparsity as sparsity = 1\u2212Top-k Experts following the convention that sparsity measures the fraction of inactive parameters. We train families of MoEs varying not only the total vs. active parameters, but also the num- ber of top-k experts. For each model, we measure the loss on the pre-training data, the task loss on the downstream benchmarks, and the accuracy on those benchmarks. This allows us to disentangle the generalization gap between the train vs. test loss, and the gap between loss vs. accuracy. For both memorization and reasoning benchmarks, the train loss decreases monotonically with the total parameters. The task loss and accuracy follow the same monotonic trend as the train loss for memorization benchmarks. In contrast, for reasoning benchmarks, the task loss and accuracy diverge from the monotonic trend as the total parameters increase and training loss decreases. We found that changing the k in top-k routing itself has a negligible effect if the number of active parameters is kept constant. We also consider classic generalization-gap controls by sweeping the learning rate and initialization, and show that their effects align strikingly with the generalization-gap caused by sparsity. This con- firms that the gap between the performance on memorization vs. reasoning tasks can be induced not only by sparsity of the MoE, but also classical hyperparameters like learning rate and initialization. We further investigate whether ap- plying GRPO or additional test-time compute could recover the poor reasoning ability of sparser models. Our results show that the gap between memorization and reasoning per- formance caused by increased sparsity remains unchanged even after GRPO and increased test-time compute. This means that finding the optimal sparsity of the MoE during pre-training is crucial for training a reasoning model under a fixed compute budget. We release model checkpoints, code and logs are open-source at https://github.com/ rioyokotalab/optimal-sparsity. 2. Background and Related Work 2.1. Mixture of Experts MoE Architecture. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) networks were introduced by (Jacobs et al., 1991; Jordan & Jacobs, 1994) and later brought to large-scale neural language mod- eling by Shazeer et al. (2017). Within the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), MoE layers have proven especially effective, scaling to hundreds of billions of param- eters while maintaining manageable training costs (Lepikhin et al., 2021; Fedus et al., 2021; Du et al., 2022; Zoph et al., 2022). Consequently, modern state-of-the-art language models, including Gemini 2.5 Pro (Gemini Team, 2025), DeepSeek-V3 (DeepSeek-AI, 2025b), and Qwen3 (Qwen Team, 2025), rely heavily",
    "to hundreds of billions of param- eters while maintaining manageable training costs (Lepikhin et al., 2021; Fedus et al., 2021; Du et al., 2022; Zoph et al., 2022). Consequently, modern state-of-the-art language models, including Gemini 2.5 Pro (Gemini Team, 2025), DeepSeek-V3 (DeepSeek-AI, 2025b), and Qwen3 (Qwen Team, 2025), rely heavily on MoE layers to achieve supe- rior performance under fixed inference budgets. In an MoE layer, a learnable router assigns each token to a sparse sub- set of experts. Let x \u2208Rdh be a token representation and {FFN(x)i}n i=1 the n feed-forward experts. For top-k rout- ing, the router produces scores s = x\u22a4Wrouter \u2208Rn, and selects the indices K of the k largest components, then normalizes them: g(x)i = exp(si) P j\u2208K exp(sj) if i \u2208K and g(x)i = 0 otherwise. The layer output is the weighted sum of the chosen experts: y = Pn i=1g(x)i FFN(x)i. Modern MoE models typically supplement the token-level cross-entropy loss with two aux- iliary terms: a load-balancing loss LLB, which prevents ex- pert collapse (Shazeer et al., 2017), and a router-z loss LRZ, which penalizes large router logits for better numerical sta- bility and gradient flow (Zoph et al., 2022). The combined training loss is expressed as L = LCE + \u03b1LLB + \u03b2LRZ, where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are hyperparameters that control the relative importance of each term in the objective function. This formulation is widely used in recent MoE-based language models and remains unchanged throughout the experiments. 2.2. Scaling Laws of LLMs Scaling Laws for MoE. Existing scaling laws demon- strate power-law relationships between model performance, parameter count, dataset size, and compute budget (Ka- plan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022). Scaling laws for MoE models have similarly explored how total parameter count and expert granularity jointly affect scaling behavior (Clark et al., 2022; Ludziejewski et al., 2024). Building on this, Frantar et al. derived sparsity-aware scaling expo- 2 Optimal Sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models for Reasoning Tasks nents that bridge dense and sparse regimes (Frantar et al., 2024), while Abnar et al. empirically charted the optimal trade-offs between total parameters and FLOPs per token in MoE settings (Abnar et al., 2025). Complementary theo- retical and empirical work shows that adding experts tends to improve memorization more than reasoning, motivating new, generalized scaling frameworks that address scaling laws for reasoning performance (Jelassi et al., 2025). Fur- thermore, recent analyses indicate that increasing sparsity itself can directly improve loss, highlighting sparsity as a key dimension in scaling behavior (Team, 2025). Task Loss.

    "increasing sparsity itself can directly improve loss, highlighting sparsity as a key dimension in scaling behavior (Team, 2025). Task Loss. Since the scaling law for next-token predic- tion loss does not necessarily align with downstream task loss, it may not be reliable for predicting benchmark per- formance (Grattafiori et al., 2024). Some work has tried to model downstream accuracy with an exponential curve, but accuracy is only predictable when we average over many tasks and carefully choose which ones to include (Gadre et al., 2024). Another line of research instead first quanti- fies how downstream task loss scales with parameters and data, then converts predicted losses into accuracy estimates, achieving under two points of absolute error for mid-scale models using minimal extra compute (Bhagia et al., 2024). Prior work observes that downstream task loss relates to pre-training loss, where the shifts depend on the minimal achievable losses determined by the intrinsic complexity and distributional mismatch between the pre-training and downstream datasets (Brandfonbrener et al., 2025). Because scaling laws differ across tasks, the optimal scaling strategy may also vary; for example, knowledge-based QA tasks are \u201ccapacity-hungry,\u201d benefiting more from larger model sizes, whereas code-related tasks are \u201cdata-hungry,\u201d benefiting more from increased training data (Roberts et al., 2025). Inverse Scaling. Standard scaling laws imply that one can indefinitely increase model and dataset size without worrying about overfitting; however, if we need to worry about generalization and overfitting, these scaling laws break down (Caballero et al., 2023). Through the Inverse Scaling Prize, Wei et al. and McKenzie et al. systematically identified tasks where larger models perform worse (Wei et al., 2023; McKenzie et al., 2023). More recently, Lourie et al argue that scaling laws are unreliable predictors of downstream task performance, framing inverse scaling as a practical constraint on model development (Lourie et al., 2025). 2.3. Post Training and Test-Time Compute (TTC) Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training has long been a predominant approach for improving LLMs. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017) forms the backbone of RLHF pipelines, from the original GPT alignment work (Ouyang et al., 2022) to the GPT-4 family of models (OpenAI, 2024a). More recently, Group Rela- tive Policy Optimization (GRPO) was introduced as a vari- ant of PPO that replaces the value function baseline with a group-relative advantage estimator, thereby improving memory efficiency and stabilizing updates; this approach already powers frontier-scale systems such as DeepSeek-R1, achieving state-of-the-art results on mathematical-reasoning benchmarks (Shao et al., 2024; DeepSeek-AI, 2025a). Complementary to these training-time advances, scaling test-time compute (TTC) offers an orthogonal approach. TTC denotes accuracy gains obtained without updating model parameters, simply by allocating more inference re- sources, e.g., running longer chains of thought (OpenAI, 2024b; Muennighoff et al., 2025b),",
    "on mathematical-reasoning benchmarks (Shao et al., 2024; DeepSeek-AI, 2025a). Complementary to these training-time advances, scaling test-time compute (TTC) offers an orthogonal approach. TTC denotes accuracy gains obtained without updating model parameters, simply by allocating more inference re- sources, e.g., running longer chains of thought (OpenAI, 2024b; Muennighoff et al., 2025b), sampling larger can- didate pools (Li et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023; Brown et al., 2024; Schaeffer et al., 2025), or performing explicit search-and-verify steps (Lightman et al., 2024; Shinn et al., 2024; Snell et al., 2025; Inoue et al., 2025). Among these, self-consistency, repeated sampling with majority-vote ag- gregation, has emerged as a strong TTC baseline (Wang et al., 2023). 3. Experiments In this section, we empirically demonstrate the scaling of downstream task performance through a systematic inves- tigation of memorization-reasoning benchmarks in MoE LLMs. 3.1. Experimental Setup We use the Mixtral (Jiang et al., 2024) architecture, a Transformer backbone with RMSNorm (Zhang & Sennrich, 2019), SwiGLU activations (Shazeer, 2020), and rotary po- sitional embeddings (Su et al., 2024). Each feed-forward block is a sparsely gated MoE layer, gated by the drop- less token-choice top-k routing (Gale et al., 2023). All models use L = 16 layers, following Muennighoff et al. (2025a). We sweep three architectural hyperparameters: (i) the model width d \u2208{512, 1024, 2048}; (ii) the num- ber of experts per layer E \u2208{8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256}; and (iii) the top-k experts per token k \u2208{2, 4, 8, 16}. Each feed-forward network has a hidden dimension of 2d. When d = 512 and d = 1024, we train every combination of E and k. For d = 2048, we limit the search to E \u2264128 due to computational resource constraints. We train with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019) using a peak learning rate of 4 \u00d7 10\u22124, a 2k-step linear warm- up followed by cosine decay, and a weight decay of 0.1. Following Xue et al. (2024) and Zoph et al. (2022), we use the load-balancing and router z-losses by 10\u22122 and 10\u22123, respectively. 3 Optimal Sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models for Reasoning Tasks Hyperparameter Study. To isolate optimization effects, we reuse the same 125 B-token corpus. For all HP runs, we fix E = 16, k = 2, and train two widths, dmodel \u2208 {512, 1024}, with the same FFN expansion factor 2. We vary (i) LM-head initialization schemes, (ii) peak learning rate, and (iii) AdamW \u03f5. Further implementation and envi- ronmental details are deferred to Appendix A.3. Pre-training Datasets. We use a balanced mixture of general-domain and mathematics-centric corpora, totaling 125 B-tokens.

Mathematical Reasoning: GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) (4-shot) and GSM-Plus (Li et al., 2024) (5-shot CoT). Reading Comprehension: Trivi- aQA (Joshi et al., 2017) with 4-shot prompting. Common- sense Reasoning: HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), each under a 4-shot prompting setup. See Appendix 3 for further details. 3.2. Downstream Performance Does Not Necessarily Improve with Total Parameter Size In this section, we examine how the expert sparsity in MoE models affects the relationship between pre-training loss and downstream performance. We train a series of models with controlled sparsity levels and measure their performance on the representative downstream tasks. Our analysis shows that while increasing the total number of parameters reduces pre-training loss, downstream task loss on mathematical reasoning worsens beyond a certain model size. Task Loss Computation. Following Brandfonbrener et al. (2025) and Grattafiori et al. (2024), we compute cross- entropy only over the answer tokens by concatenating the prompt with the ground-truth answer. For multiple-choice datasets (e.g., HellaSwag, TriviaQA) the target sequence is the correct answer string, as in Bhagia et al. (2024). For open-ended mathematics datasets such as GSM8K, and GSM-Plus we likewise compute cross-entropy directly against the ground-truth answer tokens. Training Loss and Validation Loss. Figure 1 presents the training and validation losses when fixing the top-k/MoE layer width constant and increasing only the number of ex- perts (and hence the total parameter count). As the total parameter count grows, both training and validation losses decrease. Therefore, in terms of pre-training loss, increas- ing total parameters (thereby raising sparsity) reduces pre- training loss, which is consistent with prior work. Experiments with Task Loss Next, we examine how the downstream task loss responds to increases in the to- tal parameter count. Figure 2 shows task loss on several benchmarks as we vary only the number of experts, hold- ing both top-k and each",
    "loss, which is consistent with prior work. Experiments with Task Loss Next, we examine how the downstream task loss responds to increases in the to- tal parameter count. Figure 2 shows task loss on several benchmarks as we vary only the number of experts, hold- ing both top-k and each MoE layer widths constant. On TriviaQA and HellaSwag, lower pre-training loss reduces task loss, indicating that larger total parameter models yield better results on these datasets. In contrast, for GSM8K and GSM-Plus, further reductions in pre-training loss do not translate into improved task loss; in some cases, the task loss actually worsens. These results suggest that, once top-k and layer width are fixed, an optimal number of experts exists for each task, and adding more beyond that point can harm performance on GSM8K and GSM-Plus. Dependence on Active Parameter. Can we avoid a de- cline in performance as the total number of experts in- creases? Figure 2 shows that models with more active pa- rameters begin to overfit at a lower pre-training loss and reach a lower minimum task loss at their optimal expert counts. Consequently, improving results on GSM8K and GSM-Plus requires tuning not only the total number of ex- perts but also the top-k size. Whether a similar trend occurs on other reasoning benchmarks, including code-generation tasks, remains an open question. Downstream Accuracy. The decline in math-task perfor- mance as total parameters increase is not limited to task loss; it also consistently holds for downstream accuracy (Figure 3). For TriviaQA and HellaSwag, accuracy improves mono- tonically as training loss decreases. By contrast, on GSM8K, further reductions in pre-training loss do not always translate to higher accuracy. When the number of active parameters is held constant, over-optimizing pre-training loss can in- deed harm performance. Figure 4 plots benchmark error rate against pre-training loss, including intermediate checkpoints. We observe a sparsity dependence for reasoning-oriented tasks such as GSM8K and GSM-Plus. These results suggest that, for MoE models, downstream accuracy can deviate from the predictions of conventional scaling laws, and these deviations may vary across different tasks. 4 Optimal Sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models for Reasoning Tasks 100 101 Total parameters (B) 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 Final loss Train Loss 100 101 Total parameters (B) 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 Validation Loss 100 101 Total parameters (B) 3.6 3.8 4.0 4.2 4.4 4.6 Task loss HellaSwag 100 101 Total parameters (B) 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 GSM8K d= 512,k=2 d= 512,k=4 d= 512,k=8 d= 512,k=16 d=1024,k=2 d=1024,k=4 d=1024,k=8 d=1024,k=16 d=2048,k=2 d=2048,k=4 d=2048,k=8 d=2048,k=16 Figure 1.

Although training and validation loss decrease as the total number of parameters grows, the task loss on GSM8K can sometimes worsen with larger models. Training and validation losses steadily decrease as total or active parameters increase. The HellaSwag task loss follows this scaling trend, whereas GSM8K task loss worsens once total parameters exceed a threshold. 1.6 1.8 2.0 Final training loss 8 9 10 Task loss constantly decrease TriviaQA 1.6 1.8 2.0 Final training loss 3.6 3.8 4.0 4.2 4.4 4.6 HellaSwag 1.6 1.8 2.0 Final training loss 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 begin to increase GSM8K 1.6 1.8 2.0 Final training loss 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 GSM-Plus d=512, k=2, A=170M d=512, k=4, A=220M d=512, k=8, A=320M d=512, k=16, A=520M d=1024, k=2, A=470M d=1024, k=4, A=670M d=1024, k=8, A=1.1B d=1024, k=16, A=1.9B d=2048, k=2, A=1.5B d=2048, k=4, A=2.3B d=2048, k=8, A=3.9B d=2048, k=16, A=7.1B Figure 2. For GSM8K and GSM-Plus, once the training loss drops below a certain point, the task loss starts to increase. Results of scaling total parameters by increasing the number of experts, with model width and top-k held constant. For TriviaQA and HellaSwag, the task loss falls monotonically as training loss decreases. By contrast, GSM8K and GSM-Plus show a U-shaped trend: task loss declines with training loss only until a threshold, beyond which further reductions in training loss hurt task performance. That threshold moves lower as active parameter count increases, models with more active parameters achieve a lower optimal task loss. No such active parameters dependence appears for TriviaQA, HellaSwag. 3.3. Optimal Sparsity for Iso-FLOP Budgets We next analyze model quality under a constant compute budget, that is, along IsoFLOP contours (Hoffmann et al., 2022; Abnar et al., 2025). For a fixed per-token FLOP count, we vary only the sparsity configuration: the number of experts E and the top-k value, while holding the hidden dimension and sequence length. In Figure 5, we plot the task-specific optimal sparsity (i.e. 1- TopK/Experts) against model performance under a fixed FLOPs budget. For QA benchmarks such as TriviaQA and HellaSwag, lower density (higher sparsity) consistently yields lower task loss and higher accuracy. This pattern aligns with prior studies showing that, when FLOPs are fixed to be constant, sparse models outperform denser mod- els on QA tasks (Abnar et al., 2025). By contrast, on mathematical-reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K and GSM-Plus, denser models outperform their sparser counter- parts. At lower FLOPs, increasing sparsity still reduces loss and improves accuracy; however, once the FLOPs budget grows, denser models begin to perform better, achieving",

At lower FLOPs, increasing sparsity still reduces loss and improves accuracy; however, once the FLOPs budget grows, denser models begin to perform better, achieving both lower loss and higher accuracy. This shift indicates that the optimal model density for reasoning tasks depends on compute budget: when a lot of FLOPs are available, denser models may be preferable. 3.4. Tokens per parameter The Chinchilla scaling law (Hoffmann et al., 2022) estab- lishes that, under a fixed compute budget, the optimal trade- off between model parameters and training tokens corre- sponds to approximately 20 tokens per parameter (TPP) for dense models. More recently, Roberts et al. (2025) refined this view by showing that the optimal TPP ratio is task-dependent: knowledge-based QA tasks, which are 5 Optimal Sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models for Reasoning Tasks 1.6 1.8 2.0 Final training loss 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 Accuracy TriviaQA 1.6 1.8 2.0 Final training loss 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 HellaSwag 1.6 1.8 2.0 Final training loss 0.1 0.2 0.3 GSM8K d= 512,k=2 d= 512,k=4 d= 512,k=8 d= 512,k=16 d=1024,k=2 d=1024,k=4 d=1024,k=8 d=1024,k=16 d=2048,k=2 d=2048,k=4 d=2048,k=8 d=2048,k=16 Figure 3. Downstream accuracy when scaling total parameters via expert count with width and top-k fixed. TriviaQA and HellaSwag exhibit steadily improving accuracy as pre-training loss decreases, whereas GSM8K shows a non-monotonic trend: further reductions in pre-training loss do not always improve accuracy and can even degrade performance. 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 Training loss 0.80 0.85 0.90 0.95 1.00 Error Rate TriviaQA 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 Training loss 0.60 0.63 0.66 0.69 0.72 0.75 HellaSwag 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 Training loss 0.72 0.78 0.84 0.90 0.96 1.02 GSM8K 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 Training loss 0.84 0.87 0.90 0.93 0.96 0.99 GSM-Plus Sparsity (1 - TopK / Experts) Sparsity 0.984 Sparsity 0.969 Sparsity 0.938 Sparsity 0.500 Sparsity 0.000 Figure 4. Effect of sparsity on performance across different tasks We vary sparsity (1 - top-k/Experts) and plot the relationship between pre-training loss and benchmark error rate, including intermediate checkpoints. For TriviaQA and HellaSwag, the error rate clearly tracks training loss and is largely insensitive to sparsity. In contrast, reasoning-intensive tasks such as GSM8K and GSM-Plus exhibit a strong dependence of error rate on sparsity. closer to memorization, benefit from lower TPP (i.e., more parameters), whereas reasoning-heavy tasks such as code generation benefit from higher TPP (i.e., more data). These findings highlight that TPP should be interpreted not as a universal constant, but as a task-sensitive scaling variable. In our study, although we",
    "on sparsity. closer to memorization, benefit from lower TPP (i.e., more parameters), whereas reasoning-heavy tasks such as code generation benefit from higher TPP (i.e., more data). These findings highlight that TPP should be interpreted not as a universal constant, but as a task-sensitive scaling variable. In our study, although we varied the number of experts while keeping the total FLOPs fixed, this implicitly altered the TPP measured with respect to total parameters. As shown in Figure 7, this variation reveals distinct behaviors across task categories. For memorization-oriented tasks such as Trivi- aQA and HellaSwag, performance improves monotonically as TPP decreases, consistent with the \u201cparameter-hungry\u201d characterization reported by Roberts et al. (2025). For rea- soning tasks such as GSM8K and GSM-Plus, we observe a non-monotonic trend: accuracy peaks near TPP \u224820 and then declines, suggesting that excessively low TPP (i.e., too many parameters relative to tokens) can hurt reasoning performance. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that active compute op- erationalized through the number of top-k experts interacts strongly with TPP. Even at fixed TPP, models with larger top-k values consistently outperform those with smaller top- k on reasoning tasks. This indicates that, in MoE models, reasoning ability depends not only on the Total TPP but also on the balance between total and active parameters. In other words, the discussion of compute-optimal scaling in MoE architectures must explicitly consider both total parameter count and the number of activated parameters per token. 3.5. Impact of TTC and Post-Training on Downstream Performance Test-Time Compute and RL post-training are standard for boosting reasoning on tasks such as mathematical problem solving. We therefore investigated whether performance de- clines reported above persist when applying (a) Test-Time Compute (TTC) and (b) RL post-training (GRPO). In Test- Time Compute, we evaluated GSM8K(COBBE ET AL., 2021) in a purely zero-shot setting using Self-Consistency (SC) decoding(Wang et al., 2023), generating 27 indepen- dent continuations per problem and selecting the most fre- quent answer. In Post-Training, we fine-tuned each model on the GSM8K training dataset using the GRPO algorithm (Shao et al., 2024). We followed the settings of Zhao et al. (2025) including reward function and fixed the learning rate constant across all model configurations.

Left: Final training loss vs accu- racy under Test-Time Compute (Self-Consistency). Right: Final training loss vs accuracy after GRPO post-training. GRPO mitigates the GSM8K performance drop that arises when total parameters increase. In other words, although both methods consistently improve overall performance, they do not eliminate the inverted U-shaped relationship between training loss and task accuracy. 3.6. Influence of Optimization Hyperparameter Thus far, we have demonstrated that the structure of the model, particularly the degree of sparsity, can lead to dif- ferences in reasoning performance on downstream tasks, even when the models converge to the same training loss. Such differences are similar to generalization, in which a model\u2019s behavior on unseen data reflects implicit inductive biases rather than mere fit to the training data. Studies on neural network",

Such differences are similar to generalization, in which a model\u2019s behavior on unseen data reflects implicit inductive biases rather than mere fit to the training data. Studies on neural network generalization have long recognized that not only architectural choices, but also optimization dynamics (i.e., differences in hyperparameter settings, regularization schemes, and optimizer algorithms), play an important role in shaping these inductive biases. Motivated by this insight, we examine the learning-rate scale, which is critical to gen- eralization (Keskar et al., 2017; Li et al., 2019; Yang & Hu, 2021). Our goal is to investigate how these choices influence the model\u2019s ability to transfer to downstream tasks, beyond what is captured by pre-training loss alone. Figure 8 illustrates our empirical findings, obtained us- ing a MoE architecture with 16 experts. By varying the learning rate, we evaluate performance on both QA bench- marks (TriviaQA, HellaSwag) and reasoning benchmarks 7 Optimal Sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models for Reasoning Tasks 101 102 TPP 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 Accuracy TriviaQA 101 102 TPP 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 HellaSwag 101 102 TPP 0.1 0.2 0.3 GSM8K 101 102 TPP 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 GSM-Plus d=512, k=2 d=512, k=4 d=512, k=8 d=512, k=16 d=1024, k=2 d=1024, k=4 d=1024, k=8 d=1024, k=16 d=2048, k=2 d=2048, k=4 d=2048, k=8 d=2048, k=16 Figure 7. Effect of TPP on performance across different tasks. For TriviaQA and HellaSwag, performance improves as the number of parameters increases. In contrast, for reasoning-intensive tasks such as GSM8K and GSM-Plus, performance deteriorates when the number of parameters becomes too large, indicating that there exists an optimal data to total parameter ratio for these tasks. Even at fixed TPP, models with larger top-k values consistently outperform those with smaller top-k on reasoning tasks. 1.9 2.1 2.3 2.5 Training loss 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 Accuracy TriviaQA 1.9 2.1 2.3 2.5 Training loss 0.26 0.28 0.30 0.32 0.34 0.36 0.38 0.40 HellaSwag 1.9 2.1 2.3 2.5 Training loss 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 GSM8K 1.9 2.1 2.3 2.5 Training loss 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 GSM-Plus 1.9 2.1 2.3 2.5 Training loss 10 1 100 101 102 103 104 Curvature Max Eigen Max Eigen (Linear Layer) LR = 6.4e-3 LR = 3.2e-3 LR = 1.6e-3 LR = 8e-4 LR = 4e-4 LR = 2e-4 Figure 8.

    "tasks like GSM8K and GSM-Plus, the relationship between training loss and downstream performance is dependent on the choice of optimization hyperparameters. The learning rate also impacts downstream accuracy. For the maximum eigenvalue, we evaluated the maximum eigenvalue of fisher information matrix under a K-FAC approximation (Martens & Grosse, 2015; Eschenhagen et al., 2023). Following (Grosse et al., 2023), we calculate the maximum eigenvalues only for linear layers. We find that higher learning rates lead to a lower maximum eigenvalue, which is consistent with existing research indicating that convergence to flatter minima improves generalization (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997; Keskar et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2020). (GSM8K, GSM-Plus). While QA benchmark performance like TriviaQA and HellaSwag remains largely invariant to these hyperparameters, reasoning benchmark performance like GSM8K and GSM-Plus are sensitive to the learning rates: when models converge to the same training loss, train- ings with lower learning rates and smaller initialization scales yield superior downstream accuracy. These obser- vations carry an important implication. Studies on gener- alization in large-scale language models should incorpo- rate rigorous reasoning benchmarks (such as GSM8K and GSM-Plus) rather than relying solely on validation loss curves or standard QA tasks to fully capture the impact of optimization-induced implicit biases. This enables a more precise analysis on the generalization of LLMs. 3.7. Ablation on Depth We conducted additional experiments using a 32 layer archi- tecture. Motivated by prior reports suggesting that increased depth can improve performance (Liu et al., 2024b; Team, 2024; Ye et al., 2025), we evaluated whether deeper models exhibit similar trends in our setting. For the 32 layer config- uration, we observed that the results align with the patterns discussed in the previous section, when analyzed through the lens of TPP, the behavior remains consistent with our earlier findings. 3.8. Coding Task Ablations We evaluate whether the sparsity performance trade offs ob- served for mathematical reasoning transfer to code genera- tion. Unless otherwise noted, we reuse the same architecture and optimization hyperparameters as in the experimental setup. Models are trained on a 125B token corpus com- posed of 95B tokens from Stack-Edu Python (Allal et al., 2025) (high-quality educational Python code trained for four epochs following Muennighoff et al. (2023)) and 30B tokens from DCLM-dedup web text (Zyphra, 2024). We assess pass@1 accuracy on HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) and MBPP (Austin et al., 2021).

Effect of model depth on TPP-performance trade-offs. details. Figure 10 summarizes performance as a function of MoE density k/E under matched active compute budgets. As active parameters grow, both HumanEval and MBPP exhibit a clear shift in their optima toward denser configurations: beyond a task-dependent threshold, further increasing spar- sity degrades pass@1 despite continued improvements in pre-training loss. This echoes our math findings: when com- pute allows large active capacity, denser MoE layers yield better procedural reasoning for code synthesis, whereas sparser layers are more favorable only in the low-compute regime. Detailed results for the coding tasks are provided in Appendix C.5. 4. Discussion and Limitations Dataset All models are trained on a 125B-token corpus. This corpus is Chinchilla-optimal for dense models of com- parable activated size (Hoffmann et al., 2022), yet two orders of magnitude smaller than the multi-trillion-token budgets now common for state-of-the-art MoE LLMs (DeepSeek-AI, 2025b; Qwen Team, 2025). Recent large models such as OLMo-2 and Qwen-3 adopt a multi-stage curriculum train- ing, general web pre-training followed by mid-training on math and CoT data (OLMo, 2025; Qwen Team, 2025); we avoid this design to keep a fixed data distribution and a clean link between pre-train loss and downstream accuracy, but exploring staged curricula remains important future work. These caveats render our conclusions suggestive rather than prescriptive and motivate verification at trillion-token scale with richer reasoning corpora. Model We build on the Mixtral backbone and adopt the fine-grained expert segmentation of DeepSeek-MoE: each feed-forward block is split into g = 2, so the effective expert count becomes E \u00d7 g while the total parameter bud- get stays fixed. In conjunction with standard top-k routing strategy (k \u2208{2, 4, 8, 16}) and the auxiliary importance / load-balance loss of Shazeer et al. (2017), our hyperparam- eter sweep evaluates configurations with up to 256 active experts. This is contrast to contemporary MoE variants such as Qwen-3, which primarily differ from Mixtral by the integration of only QK-Norm and a global load-balancing regularizer. These modifications are negligible in compar- ison to the scale of changes evaluated in our experiments. For scaling, the number of experts is more influential than minor structural details. We explore configurations with up to 256 experts and a top-16 routing strategy, which offers a sufficiently",

For scaling, the number of experts is more influential than minor structural details. We explore configurations with up to 256 experts and a top-16 routing strategy, which offers a sufficiently broad range for our purposes. We acknowl- edge that gating design choices, such as the formulation of the load-balance loss, might affect how expert scaling influences performance; we leave this for future work. The patterns we report are intended as provisional observations rather than definitive rules. We encourage further studies to examine these effects at larger model scales. 5. Conclusion In this paper, we investigated the optimal sparsity of MoE language models through the lens of downstream task per- formance. By training families of Mixtral-style MoEs with various number of experts, top-k routing, and model width, and by evaluating them across pre-training, GRPO post- training, and test-time compute, we show that the classical \u201cmore experts is better\u201d rule holds for knowledge-oriented benchmarks such as TriviaQA and HellaSwag, but not for mathematical reasoning benchmarks. On reasoning tasks, downstream task loss starts to rise, and accuracy to fall, once total parameters grow at a certain point; in this regime, mod- els with more active parameters may achieve lower optimal task loss, whereas those with extreme sparsity over-fit de- spite lower pre-training loss. Neither reinforcement-learning post-training nor additional test-time compute removes this trade-off. These findings update current scaling practice. When computational budget is fixed, allocating FLOPs to extra experts improves memorization, but improving reason- 9 Optimal Sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models for Reasoning Tasks 1 1/2 1/4 1/8 1/16 1/32 1/64 1/128 MoE Density (k/E) 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 Accuracy TriviaQA 1 1/2 1/4 1/8 1/16 1/32 1/64 1/128 MoE Density 0.300 0.325 0.350 0.375 0.400 0.425 0.450 HellaSwag 1 1/2 1/4 1/8 1/16 1/32 1/64 1/128 MoE Density 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 HumanEval 1 1/2 1/4 1/8 1/16 1/32 1/64 1/128 MoE Density 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 MBPP 27 28 29 210 211 212 Active Params (millions) Figure 10.

    "total 125.0B 973.4B A. Training Setup A.1. Pre-training Dataset Details Table 1 details the pre-training corpus: for each subset, it lists the Hugging Face repository, split identifier, and public URL, alongside the original size and the number of subsampled tokens we used (125 B tokens in the 99:1 train/validation split, as counted by the llm-jp tokenizer v3 with 99,487 tokens). Thus, the total token budget is fixed in strict accordance with Kaplan\u2019s scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), meaning the observed loss increase (and the accompanying puzzling overfitting that mirrors behavior recently reported by (OLMo, 2025; OpenAI, 2024a)) cannot be attributed to any change in data volume. A.2. Post-Training Details We use GRPO(Shao et al., 2024) with a batch size of 1024, train for 15 epochs, and truncate prompts and generated sequences to 512 and 1024 tokens respectively. The actor\u2019s learning rate is fixed at 5 \u00d7 10\u22126; the temperature is set to 1.0, the KL-penalty coefficient to 10\u22123, and 5 samples are used per prompt. Optimisation employs Adam with \u03b2 = (0.9, 0.999), \u03f5 = 10\u22128, and weight decay of 10\u22122. Following Zhao et al. (2025), we implemented a code-execution-based evaluator supporting TinyGSM-style and OpenMathInstruct-1 outputs. For a width of 2048 with 16 or 64 experts, we swept the learning rate (Fig. 11) and subsequently fixed it to 5 \u00d7 10\u22126 for all GRPO experiments. 15 Optimal Sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models for Reasoning Tasks Table 2.

Implementation & Training Environment We executed all pre-training runs on the ABCI 3.0 supercomputer (Takano et al., 2024), equipped with NVIDIA H200 GPUs with board-level power capped at 500 W per GPU. TTC experiments were conducted on the TSUBAME 4.0 supercomputer at the Global Scientific Information and Computing Center, Institute of Science Tokyo. They used NVIDIA H100 SXM5 94 GB GPUs (four GPUs per node) and InfiniBand NDR200 interconnects for inter-node communication. For pre-training, we extended the Megatron-LM1 codebase to add functionality needed for this study, with support for pipeline, tensor, and expert parallelism. Reinforcement learning experiments were implemented using GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) on top of the VerL2 framework. Model quality was assessed using lm-evaluation-harness3 and LargeLanguageMon- keys4. B. Evaluation Setup We evaluate our models using the lm-evaluation-harness framework (Gao et al., 2024) across four key capability areas. All evaluations employ standard few-shot prompting strategies unless otherwise specified. We assess logical reasoning capabilities using Mathematical problem-solving is evaluated using GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) with 4-shot prompting and GSM-Plus (Li et al., 2024) with 5-shot CoT prompting. We evaluate comprehension abilities using TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017) with 4-shot prompting.

Table 3 provides comprehensive details for all evaluation benchmarks. C. Additional Experiments C.1. GRPO Training on MATH 500 Dataset Following the analysis presented in Section 3.5, the inverted U-shaped relationship between training loss and task accuracy persists even after applying GRPO. To verify that this phenomenon is not due to performing GRPO on the GSM8K dataset, we conducted additional GRPO experiments on the MATH 500 dataset (Lightman et al., 2024). As illustrated in Figure 12, GRPO on the MATH dataset yields consistent results with those obtained on the GSM8K dataset, confirming that this inverted U-shaped relationship is robust across different GRPO training datasets. C.2. Test-Time Compute Evaluation Setup We evaluated both GSM8K(Cobbe et al., 2021) in a purely zero-shot setting using Self-Consistency (SC) decoding(Wang et al., 2023), generating 27 independent continuations per problem and selecting the most frequent answer with 128 samples per problem. Specifically, for each prompt we generated up to 1,024 tokens under temperature 0.6 and nucleus sampling (top-p = 0.95), drawing 128 independent continuations and selecting the most frequent answer. 17 Optimal Sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models for Reasoning Tasks 1.70 1.75 1.80 1.85 1.90 Final training loss 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 Accuracy GRPO on GSM8K 1.70 1.75 1.80 1.85 1.90 Final training loss 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 GRPO on MATH 500 d=1024,k=2 before GRPO d=1024,k=4 after GRPO d=1024,k=8 d=1024,k=16 Figure 12. Comparison of GSM8K accuracy for models fine-tuned with GRPO on different training datasets (left: GSM8K, right: MATH 500). Performance decline is consistently observed across different training datasets. Zero-shot VS Few-shot To set up Test Time Compute appropriately, we investigate how varying the number of prompt shots affected each expert\u2019s behavior (Figure 13). Few shot performance is unstable and dropped significantly for models with a small number of experts, so we use zero shot inference for Test Time Compute. When few shot chain of thought is used to standardize answer formats, the provided demonstration steps can be internalized as a fixed reasoning pattern by the model. As a result, the model\u2019s inherent inference capabilities may not be fully expressed, and its ability to generalize to novel problems could be hindered (Kojima et al., 2022). Temperature Figure 14 shows that the inverted",
    "the provided demonstration steps can be internalized as a fixed reasoning pattern by the model. As a result, the model\u2019s inherent inference capabilities may not be fully expressed, and its ability to generalize to novel problems could be hindered (Kojima et al., 2022). Temperature Figure 14 shows that the inverted U-shaped performance-decline trend holds across every temperature setting, indicating that sampling temperature does not affect this behavior. This suggests that, although temperature controls inference randomness, the primary drivers of performance decline are inherent to model architecture rather than temperature settings. Evaluation of Larger Generation Budget We extended the sample size used for Test-Time Compute as described in Section 3.5, generating a larger set of candidate responses. We then measured the resulting accuracy across different generation budgets to assess how increased sampling influences performance (Figure 15). For an active parameter count of 8 (top-8), the performance decline is gradually mitigated, whereas for an active parameter count of 2 (top-2), the decline is instead amplified, resulting in a more pronounced U-shaped trend. Although increasing the sample count further may provide additional insights, it remains challenging to identify a consistent mitigation pattern across all models. Increasing Top-k During Inference We compared the performance under TTC for model with a hidden dimension of 2048, 128 experts, and top-2 routing by varying the inference-time top-k parameter. (Figure 16) Specifically, although doubling top-k sometimes yielded temporary improvements in Pass@1, applying TTC ultimately showed that the original top-2 setting maintained the highest performance, suggesting that no fundamental performance gain occurs. C.3. GSM8K Overfitting Analysis To investigate whether our model overfits to GSM8K due to the inclusion of GSM8K training data and its synthetic derivatives, we conducted an ablation experiment removing major GSM8K-related datasets from our pre-training corpus as listed in Table 2. We removed TinyGSM-MIND, both GSM8K train split instances, Dolmino SynthMath, OpenMathInstruct-1, and 18 Optimal Sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models for Reasoning Tasks 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 Generation budget 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 Accuracy 16 Experts 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 Generation budget 0.175 0.200 0.225 0.250 0.275 0.300 0.325 0.350 32 Experts 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 Generation budget 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 64 Experts 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 Generation budget 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 128 Experts 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 Generation budget 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 256 Experts 0 shot 2 shot 4 shot 8 shot Figure 13.

OpenMathInstruct-2, which contain either the original GSM8K training data or synthetic problems derived from it. The results are shown in Figure 17 and 18. We observe that the trends with respect to sparsity on GSM8K remain unchanged, both for Pass@1 and TTC metrics. This indicates that while GSM8K training data and its synthetic derivatives do improve GSM8K scores, they do not alter the underlying performance trends. However, after post-training, we observe some changes in these trends, which we leave as future work to investigate further. C.4. GSM8K Problem Analysis We investigated whether models with varying numbers of experts exhibit differences in their ability to solve specific problems on the GSM8K dataset. Figure 19 shows the results. We observe that different sparsity levels solve different instances of the problems. C.5. Detailed Results for Coding Tasks This appendix provides detailed results for the coding task ablations, mirroring the analyses for mathematical reasoning presented in the main text. Specifically, we detail the non-monotonic relationship between scaling and downstream performance, showing how both task loss (Figure 20, 21) and accuracy (Figure 22) can degrade as pre-training loss improves. We then analyze key architectural factors, including the impact of MoE sparsity (Figure 23) and the optimal Tokens-per-Parameter (TPP) ratio (Figure 24). 19 Optimal Sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models for Reasoning Tasks 1.75 1.80 1.85 1.90 Final Loss 0.2 0.3 0.4 Accuracy Top-2 1.70 1.75 1.80 1.85 1.90 Final Loss 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 Top-4 1.70 1.75 1.80 1.85 Final Loss 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 Top-8 1.65 1.70 1.75 1.80 Final Loss 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 Top-16 samples 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 Figure 15.

While doubling k can occasionally improve Pass@1, applying TTC ultimately shows that the original top-2 configuration delivers the highest performance. 20 Optimal Sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models for Reasoning Tasks 1 1/2 1/4 1/8 1/16 1/32 1/64 1/128 MoE Density (k/E) 7.5 8.0 8.5 9.0 9.5 10.0 Task loss TriviaQA 1 1/2 1/4 1/8 1/16 1/32 1/64 1/128 MoE Density 3.6 3.8 4.0 4.2 4.4 4.6 HellaSwag 1 1/2 1/4 1/8 1/16 1/32 1/64 1/128 MoE Density 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 GSM8K 1 1/2 1/4 1/8 1/16 1/32 1/64 1/128 MoE Density 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 GSM Plus 27 28 29 210 211 212 Active Params (millions) 1 1/2 1/4 1/8 1/16 1/32 1/64 1/128 MoE Density (k/E) 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 Accuracy TriviaQA 1 1/2 1/4 1/8 1/16 1/32 1/64 1/128 MoE Density 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 HellaSwag 1 1/2 1/4 1/8 1/16 1/32 1/64 1/128 MoE Density 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 GSM8K 1 1/2 1/4 1/8 1/16 1/32 1/64 1/128 MoE Density 0.00 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.14 GSM-Plus 27 28 29 210 211 212 Active Params (millions) Figure 17.

    "Membership Inference Attacks on LLM-based Recommender Systems Jiajie He1\u2217, Yuechun Gu1\u2020, Min-Chun Chen1\u2021, Keke Chen1\u00a7 1University of Maryland, Baltimore County Abstract Recommender systems (RecSys) have become an es- sential component of many web applications. The core of the system is a recommendation model trained on highly sensitive user-item interaction data. While privacy-enhancing techniques are actively studied in the research community, the real-world model devel- opment still depends on minimal privacy protection, e.g., via controlled access. Users of such systems should have the right to choose not to share highly sensitive interactions. However, there is no method allowing the user to know which interactions are more sensitive than others. Thus, quantifying the privacy risk of RecSys training data is a critical step to en- abling privacy-aware RecSys model development and deployment. We propose a membership-inference at- tack (MIA)- based privacy scoring method, RecPS, to measure privacy risks at both the interaction and user levels. The RecPS interaction-level score defi- nition is motivated and derived from differential pri- vacy, which is then extended to the user-level scor- ing method. A critical component is the interaction- level MIA method RecLiRA, which gives high-quality membership estimation. We have conducted exten- sive experiments on well-known benchmark datasets and RecSys models to show the unique features and benefits of RecPS scoring in risk assessment and Rec- Sys model unlearning. 1 Introduction Recommendation systems (RecSys) have seen signif- icant advances over the past decade and have been widely used in various scenarios such as job matching [11], e-commerce [10], and entertainment [18]. How- ever, one critical challenge is still difficult to tackle: recommendation models are naturally task-specific, \u2217jiajih1@umbc.edu \u2020ygu2@umbc.edu \u2021mchen2@umbc.edu \u00a7kekechen@umbc.edu as they are typically trained with task-specific user- item interactions [30, 44]. Therefore, it is almost im- possible to move a recommendation system developed for one domain to another without significant perfor- mance degradation. Collecting new training data to build a new recommendation system has been a well- accepted practice. However, it is expensive and time- consuming. Practitioners and researchers have been looking for more efficient approaches to addressing this domain locked-in issue. With the emerging applications of large language models (LLMs), researchers wonder whether LLMs can be used to gain the highly desired low-cost cross- domain generalization power of RecSys. Earlier ef- forts focused on fine-tuning general-purpose LLMs for a specific recommendation domain, including P5 [19], M6-Rec [14], and TALLRec [3], which often in- volved expensive adjustments. Most recent studies turned to In-Context Learning (ICL) methods that use cheap zero-shot or few-shots prompts to simplify the customization of LLM for RecSys [25, 30]. These methods have shown comparable or even better rec- ommendation quality [25, 44] than more expensive and sophisticated fine-tuning methods. While ICL",

These methods have shown comparable or even better rec- ommendation quality [25, 44] than more expensive and sophisticated fine-tuning methods. While ICL offers substantial advantages through the power of prompts, its integration into language mod- els raises a critical issue: privacy leakage via prompts [39]. It is well known that the success of recommenda- tion systems is based on user-interaction data, which often contains private information about user prefer- ences, activities, and social contexts [9, 38, 42, 46]. In few-shot ICL RecSys, such data is used by Rec- Sys to design personalized system prompts. Figure 1 shows a typical example, where the user\u2019s sensitive historical interactions marked in red. One of the most fundamental privacy attacks is the membership inference attack (MIA) [5, 22, 27] that identifies whether a record is used in the model train- ing dataset. While most MIAs focused on classifi- cation modeling, researchers have recently identified the unique features of traditional RecSys models for MIAs, such as matrix factorization RecSys [24], feder- 1 arXiv:2508.18665v1 [cs.IR] 26 Aug 2025 Figure 1: Prompt Example for LLM RecSys ated RecSys [28], and knowledge-based RecSys [37], and designed several RecSys-specific MIA methods [23, 41, 42, 46]. However, LLM-based RecSys have several unique features that the MIA methods de- signed for traditional RecSys models cannot be di- rectly applied. \u2022 The traditional RecSys MIAs utilize the system output, i.e., the recommended items, to infer whether the core RecSys machine learning model has used the target user\u2019s information in train- ing. The inference utilizes the similarity between the recommended items and the known victim user\u2019s interacted items, where item embedding, i.e., item\u2019s vector representation, is used in the similarity evaluation. The item embedding is generated from a large number of existing user- item interactions, via, e.g., matrix factorization [24] methods, which works effectively for non- LLM RecSys. However, this is a very strong attack assumption. In practice, the interaction matrix may not be accessible. We do not know whether and how the similarity-based method still works for LLM-based RecSys outputs, e.g., via general text semantic embedding. \u2022 Existing RecSys MIAs [41, 43, 46] assume that the training data distribution is known by the adversary, which is used to train shadow mod- els offline to mimic the behavior of the target model, which are then used to build the attack model. In LLM-based RecSys, the training data now appear in the system prompts.

The concept of shadow models needs to be re-examined and it is unclear whether the assumption of known training data distribution is necessary and how it can be used in attacks. \u2022 LLMs have some distinct features that other ma- chine learning models do not have, such as hal- lucination [25] and memorization [6]. These fea- tures might enable new attacks distinct from those on traditional RecSys models. However, no study has been done on attacks utilizing such features for LLM RecSys. To our knowledge, no MIA method has been re- ported on LLM-based RecSys. Understanding such new MIA methods will allow LLM RecSys designers to be aware of potential privacy threats and incorpo- rate privacy protection measures into system design. Scope of Our Research. We design, evaluate and analyze four membership inference attacks on LLM- powered RecSys that use in-context learning, i.e., prompts, to customize the recommendation. These attacks target the private user-item interactions1 embedded in system prompts by the LLM RecSys provider. We assume that the attacker has known the target user\u2019s historical interactions but not known whether any of these interactions were used by the LLM RecSys to compose the system prompts. \u2022 Direct Inquiry attack utilizes the basic gener- ative features of LLMs, where the attacker di- rectly asks the LLM whether it has seen the vic- tim user. \u2022 Hallucination attack investigates the likeli- hood that LLM hallucination may occur more often when the system has not seen the query. This attack explores the novel application of the unique LLM hallucination phenomenon. \u2022 Similarity attack identifies target users as mem- bers if items recommended by LLM have high similarity to the user\u2019s historical interactions known by the adversary. It resembles the sim- ilarity attack in the traditional RecSys MIA. However, since the RecSys-specific item embed- ding is not available for LLMs, we will depend on general text embedding to evaluate similarity. \u2022 Poisoning attack uses the modified historical interactions as user-provided additional prompts and observes the change in recommended items to infer whether the target user is a member. The intuition is that if the user\u2019s interactions were used by the system, it may memorize them and the poisoned interactions less likely change the system\u2019s recommendations. This attack ex- plores another unique feature: LLM memoriza- tion, in MIAs. We have conducted extensive experiments on three popular large language models that have been used to develop LLM RecSys and two well-known benchmark datasets: MovieLens-1M and Amazon Digital Music.

Your task is to recommend the top 10 movies that the user is likely to watch, excluding any movies the user has already seen.

We further analyze factors influencing successful at- tacks, including the number of shots used by system prompts and the positions of the attacked shots in the prompt. The results shows these factors have varying effect on different LLMs and datasets. These findings may offer insights for designing system prompts that are more resilient against privacy attacks. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: \u2022 To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose and study membership inference attacks against ICL-LLM-powered RecSys. \u2022 We have designed Direct Inquiry, Hallucination, Similarity, and Poisoning attacks, aiming to ef- fectively detect whether users are used in RecSys system prompts. \u2022 We have conducted extensive experiments to show the performance of these attacks, among which Direct Inquiry and Poisoning attacks work best for some LLMs. We have also studied the factors affecting these attacks. The remaining sections include a discussion on the related work focusing on MIAs on RecSys and LLMs (Section 2), the preliminaries about the proposed methods describing how ICL-LLM-powered RecSys works (Section 3), the new threat model (Section 4), the four MIA methods (Section 5), the experimen- tal evaluation exploring the attack performance and factors affecting these attacks (Section 6), and a con- clusion about this study (Section 7). 2 Related Work In this section, we introduce current status of MIA studies on LLM and on RecSys, respectively.",

While widely studied in traditional machine learning [22, 27, 32, 42], MIA has become increasingly concerning in the context of large language models (LLMs), as revealing whether specific data appears in prompts can lead to breaches of sensitive or pri- vate information. Theoretical foundations of MIA largely rely on the observation that models behave more confidently on samples seen during training [5, 27]. A common at- tack strategy is to train a classifier attack model using the target model\u2019s output posteriors\u2019 proba- bilities, where higher-confidence outputs are deemed more likely to be members. To improve attack perfor- mance, researchers have also incorporated additional cues such as intermediate representations [33], loss trajectories [31], or trained shadow models on crafted datasets [5]. In all of these instances, it seems that having access to the model posterior is a necessary requirement for launching the attack. Most existing membership inference attacks against LLMs necessi- tate, at a minimum, access to the probability associ- ated with predictions. This requirement is crucial for calculating corresponding loss [16, 40] or perplexity [7, 8], which can then be used to extract membership signals. Recent work has explored posterior-free MIA tech- niques [13, 29] that infer membership by estimating a sample\u2019s distance to the decision boundary. However, such approaches have their own challenges due to their black-box nature and the discrete input space. Rui et al. [39] proposed text-only MIAs against LLMs on the classification task which cannot apply to rec- ommendation task due to the entirely different prob- lem settings. 2.2 MIA on RecSys The earlier RecSys MIA studies are focused on the user level. Zhang et al. [42] propose the Item-Diff method for inferring membership in a target RecSys by analyzing the similarity between a user\u2019s historical interactions and recommended items. The core idea is that, for users in the training set, their historical interactions are likely to be more closely aligned with the items recommended by the system. Wang et al. [38] propose the DL-MIA framework to improve Item- Diff with a VAE-based encoder and weight estima- tor to address issues with Item-Diff. More recently, Wei et al. [41] proposed a white-box interaction-level membership inference on",

[38] propose the DL-MIA framework to improve Item- Diff with a VAE-based encoder and weight estima- tor to address issues with Item-Diff. More recently, Wei et al. [41] proposed a white-box interaction-level membership inference on federated RecSys. Zhong et al. [46] proposed another interaction-level mem- bership inference on Knowledge Graph-based RecSys, utilizing the similarity matrix between the interacted items and the recommended items. To our knowl- edge, no MIA study is reported on LLM RecSys. 3 3 Preliminaries In this section, we introduce In-context learning Rec- Sys in Section 3.1 3.1 In-context learning(ICL) RecSys In-Context Learning (ICL) is a distinctive feature of large language models (LLMs) [4], enabling them to perform specific tasks by observing a few ex- amples\u2014without updating model parameters. ICL LLMs learn through analogy [15] by appending input- output demonstrations, known as prompts, during in- ference. Introduced alongside GPT-3 [4], Figure 2: System Architecture for ICL-RecSys ICL has proven effective in adapting LLMs to vari- ous downstream tasks, particularly in recommenda- tion systems (RecSys). According to Gao et al. [17], its success stems from the design of prompts and in- context demonstrations. In other words, the key in- novation of ICL is to elicit the in-context ability of LLMs for learning (new or unseen) downstream tasks from context during the inference stage. In partic- ular, two settings proposed in ICL are prevalently leveraged for prompting LLMs for RecSys: few-shot, where the model is guided by a few input-output ex- amples, and zero-shot, where only natural language task descriptions are provided. Both rely on the model\u2019s ability to generalize from context, but few- shot ICL typically achieves better performance due to the inclusion of in-context demonstrations. Sev- eral studies compare these settings under the same recommendation tasks [30, 44, 45] and find that few- shot learning outperforms zero-shot approaches. To adapt large language models (LLMs) to recom- mendation tasks via in-context learning (ICL), a straightforward strategy is to prompt LLMs to act as recommenders. For instance, Liu et al. [30] uti- lize ChatGPT with task-specific prompts for top-k recommendation and explanation generation. Their method involves constructing tailored input-output examples for each task, demonstrating that few-shot settings consistently yield better performance than zero-shot ones. Similarly, other studies have proposed distinct strategies for designing effective in-context demonstrations to enhance recommendation perfor- mance. For example, [45] introduces role-based tex- tual descriptions, such as \u201cYou are a book rating ex- pert,\u201d to augment in-context prompts. This role in- jection technique helps mitigate cases where LLMs refuse to perform recommendation tasks (e.g., re- sponding with \u201cAs a language model, I don\u2019t have the ability to recommend ...\u201d).

This role in- jection technique helps mitigate cases where LLMs refuse to perform recommendation tasks (e.g., re- sponding with \u201cAs a language model, I don\u2019t have the ability to recommend ...\u201d). In summary, ICL serves as a critical bridge connecting LLMs with down- stream tasks such as recommendation systems, en- abling LLMs to emulate the behavior of traditional recommenders and effectively interact with users. Figure 2 shows how an LLM-based RecSys may look like. The core components include the LLM, the database containing many users\u2019 historical interac- tions, and a prompt composer that can adapt to the recommendation task and each specific user\u2019s prefer- ences. In this work, we propose a text-only membership in- ference attack on ICL-based RecSys, which operates under the most constrained setting: the adversary only has access to the user interacted item and gener- ated recommended item, not the probabilities, which aligns with the common black-box setting in the rec- ommendation task [42]. Figure 3: Prompt Example 4 THREAT MODEL 4.1 Adversary\u2019s Objective The primary objective of the adversary is to deter- mine whether a specific target user u was included in the construction of a prompt used to customize a 4 ~ a \u2014_\u2014__ > Recommendations User System prompts Prompt Composer Users\u2019 historical interactions Instruction task: Pretend you are a movie recommender system. Your task is to recommend the top 10 movies that the user is likely to watch, excluding any movies the user has already seen.

For simplicity, we have used the binary sam- ples \u2013 (uk, ik) implies the user uk interacted ik. The detailed prompt sample is shown in Figure 3.

    "we have used the binary sam- ples \u2013 (uk, ik) implies the user uk interacted ik. The detailed prompt sample is shown in Figure 3. The adversary\u2019s goal is to determine whether the target user u has been utilized in crafting the system prompt that the LLM RecSys has used to improve the rele- vance of recommended items, i.e., to find out whether u \u2208{u1, . . . , uk}. 4.2 Adversary\u2019s Capabilities The adversary can access the large language model for RecSys, customized via prompts in a known for- mat, as indicated in previous research in LLM RecSys [25, 30]. The adversary has known the target user\u2019s historical interactions and wanted to know whether they are used in prompts. We consider the most strict and realistic scenario, where the adversary has only black-box access to the target language model M and its recommended items, but not the tokenizer or the associated output probabilities. We also assume the adversary can access general word embeddings ob- tained via open-source LLMs (not the target LLM), which can be used in the similarity attack. 5 ATTACK METHODS 5.1 Direct Inquiry Attack Intuition. The core concept of this attack method hinges on the language model\u2019s ability to remem- ber information from past conversations and deliver context-based responses. When we interact with a language model, it processes the context and pro- duces a response informed by the knowledge it has acquired from previous inputs by the user, particu- larly from the interaction examples included in the RecSys system prompts. Consequently, an intuitive approach is to directly question the language model about its previous encounters with specific samples. Method. The attack methodology is structured as follows (refer to Figure 4 for an illustration): \u2022 The adversary selects a target user u to deter- mine whether the user showed up in prompts. Figure 4: The direct inquiry attack \u2022 The adversary crafts a query to the model with the prompt: \u201cHave you seen the user u? Only Answer Yes or No\u201d. \u2022 The adversary sends the query to the model and observes the model\u2019s response. If the model con- firms with a \u201cyes\u201d, the user is considered as a member of the dataset; if not, it is considered a non-member. For LLMs that memorize the prompts, this attack might work. We have witnessed Llama-3 behaves so in experiments. 5.2 Hallucination Attack Intuition. Hallucination is a common problem with LLMs. In LLM-based RecSys, hallucination may cause the LLM to recommend items out of the do- main, i.e., the global item set I. When we inter- act with a language model, it processes the context and recommends items provided by the user conver- sation and system prompts. We hypothesize",
    "with LLMs. In LLM-based RecSys, hallucination may cause the LLM to recommend items out of the do- main, i.e., the global item set I. When we inter- act with a language model, it processes the context and recommends items provided by the user conver- sation and system prompts. We hypothesize that if the model has seen something related to the user be- fore, the probability of hallucinated items might be lower. Specifically, if the number is higher than a threshold, it is likely a non-member. Method. The attack method consists of the follow- ing steps (see Figure 5 for an illustration): \u2022 The adversary selects a target user u to deter- mine the membership. \u2022 The adversary crafts a query to the model with a prompt, e.g., \u201cPlease recommend top-10 movies sorted in descending order of relevance for u. Only give movie names without any description\u201d. \u2022 The adversary counts the number of hallucinated items in the set of recommended items out of 5 Pretend you are a movie recommender system. Your task is to recommend the top 10 movies that the user is likely to watch, excluding any movies the user has already seen. James Wiseman watched The Insider, ... ,Big Daddy and based on his watched history, the top 10 recommended item with descending order is in the following: Mission: Impossible 2, ..., American Pie. Have you seen James Wiseman before? Please answer one word: Yes or No Figure 5: The hallucination attack the defined item set I. If this number is larger than threshold it is considered a non-member, vice versa. In experiments, we have used IMDB to generate the global item set, I, for movies, and MusicBrainz for musics. A threshold of 2 for 10 recommended items seems to work for the experimented models. How- ever, the attack advantages are low. 5.3 Similarity Attack Intuition. This attack uses the memorization ca- pability of language models to estimate whether the LLM recommended items similar to the user\u2019s histor- ical item interactions known by the adversary. We hypothesize that if the LLM has seen the user\u2019s his- torical interactions, the recommended items might be similar to historical interactions. This similarity- based attack is borrowed from the attack on tradi- tional RecSys models [42]. However, the similarity calculation is the key. The previous attack made the strong assumption that the adversary also knows the item embedding vectors derived from a large set of known interactions. Considering it is almost impos- sible to get such embedding vectors in realistic at- tacks without breaking into the RecSys internal. We redesigned the similarity measuring method for LLM RecSys with general semantic text embedding gener- ated by LLMs. We then use the following",

We redesigned the similarity measuring method for LLM RecSys with general semantic text embedding gener- ated by LLMs. We then use the following method to estimate the similarity between the recommended items and the user\u2019s historical interactions. Method. The attack method consists of the follow- ing steps (see Figure 6 for an illustration): Figure 6: The similarity attack \u2022 The adversary selects a target user u to deter- mine its membership status. \u2022 The adversary crafts a query to the model with a prompt like \u201cPlease recommend top-10 movies sorted by a descending order of relevance for u. Only give movie names without any description\u201d. \u2022 The attacker calculates the pairwise similar- ity between each recommended item and each item in the historical interaction set. The aver- age similarity is used to infer membership sta- tus. If the average similarity exceeds a prede- fined threshold \u03c4, the interaction is classified as a member; otherwise, it is considered a non- member. Formally, let R = {r1, r2, . . . , rm} de- note the set of recommended items and I = {i1, i2, . . . , in} denote the historical interacted items. Let sim(r, i) denote a similarity function between items r and i. The average similarity is computed as: AvgSim(Ru, Iu) = 1 m \u00b7 n X r\u2208Ru X i\u2208Iu sim(r, i). (1) In experiments, we have used the Sentence- Transformer network [34], a widely utilized text encoder, to embed items and the cosine similar- ity for pairwise similarity calculation. However, we noticed that LLMs will not duplicate the seen historical items or fine-tune the list, even though the user has been included in prompts, which is expected for a reasonable RecSys. Therefore, since the general text embedding does not con- tain the unique user-item interaction information as the traditional item embedding does [42], we 6 Pretend you are a movie recommender system.

Mission: Impossible 2,Transformer, ..., American Pie have seen the similarity attacks does not work ideally. 5.4 Poisoning Attack Intuition. We design the poisoning attack to fur- ther exploit the memorization capability of LLMs. We hypothesize that if the model has previously seen the target user\u2019s interactions, it will exhibit a certain degree of \u201cstubbornness\u201d. Specifically, if the adver- sary shows additional prompts that contain the tar- geted user\u2019s modified historical interactions, the LLM having the memory of the correct historical interac- tions is less likely to change its mind. In contrast, if the model has not seen the historical interactions, its recommended items might be more influenced by the provided modified items. Figure 7: The poisoning attack Method. It consists of the following steps (see Fig- ure 7 for an illustration): \u2022 The adversary selects a target user u to deter- mine its membership status. \u2022 The adversary crafts a query to the model with a prompt like \u201cPlease recommend top-10 movies sorted by the descending order of relevance for u. Only give movie names without any descrip- tion.\u201d The system returns the initial recom- mended items R0. \u2022 The adversary further provides a prompt with the modified historical interactions, e.g., \u201cThe user James Wiseman previously interacted with items (i1, i2, . . . , in), can you recommended an- other list of 10 movies?\u201d The modified list (i1, i2, . . . , in) is generated as follows. The ad- versary randomly selects and replaces items in a user\u2019s original interaction set Iu with low- similarity items from the total set I. In the movie recommendation case, we used all the movies in the IMDB dataset. Specifically, for a selected item i0 k \u2208Iu, the attacker substitutes it with an item ik such that: ik = arg min j\u2208IMDB sim(i0 k, j). (2) \u2022 The attacker gets another list of recommended items, R1. Then the similarity between R0 and R1 is calculated with the same average similar- ity formula Eq. 1. The",
    "k \u2208Iu, the attacker substitutes it with an item ik such that: ik = arg min j\u2208IMDB sim(i0 k, j). (2) \u2022 The attacker gets another list of recommended items, R1. Then the similarity between R0 and R1 is calculated with the same average similar- ity formula Eq. 1. The membership inference decision is based on the similarity gap. If the similarity gap is less than the predefined \u03c4, it im- plies the LLM\u2019s decision is less likely influenced by the modified list, and the user\u2019s interactions may have shown up in the system\u2019s prompts. 6 EXPERIMENTS The experiments try to answer the following ques- tions in our attack design. (1) Will the RecSys LLM likely leak the user\u2019s information via direct inquiry? (2) Can the previously reported similarity-checking attack [42, 46] also work in the LLM context? (3) Can the LLM\u2019s memorization feature be explored to infer membership? (4) What are the factors affecting the performance of membership inference? 6.1 Experiment setup Large Language Models. We evaluate our attacks on three representative language models, including Llama-2 [36], Llama-3 [36], and Vicuna [12] that have been used in studying LLM RecSys [25, 44]. For Llama-2 and Llama-3, we utilize the 7B and 8B ver- sions, respectively. Vicuna is an instruct-finetuned version of Llama-2. We utilize the 13B version of Vicuna. In general, newer models may have im- proved some aspects, i.e., the reduced hallucinations and better relevance of the recommended items. We use these models for experiments because they have shown their effectiveness for RecSys in previous stud- ies. More recent models, e.g., Llama-4, may show better recommendation performance. However, to isolate the unknown factors, we decide to use these models only for easier comparison and better repro- ducibility. Datasets. We assess the impact of our attacks on MovieLens-1M [21] and Amazon Digital Music [26]. The statistic of the dataset is shown in Ta- ble 1. For hallucination attack, we use IMDB [1] on 7 Pretend you are a movie recommender system.

Also, we find the MusicBrainz [2] can be used as corpus on the Amazon Digital Music to decide whether the LLM\u2019s output is hallucinated item. The recommendation- specific prompts are designed using the template pro- vided by Liu et al. [30] known for its verified perfor- mance. It is worth noting that our objective is to determine if the target user information is used in the system prompt. However, it is likely that the LLM has seen relevant text samples in the original LLM pre-training data, which we cannot distinguish. However, as demonstrated in this study [39], LLMs exhibit significantly weaker memorization about pre- training data, compared to the data in prompts. Evaluation Metrics. Since we focus on whether each attack works and their relative performance over different settings, we consider the widely adopted metric in related studies [39] \u2013 the attack advantage: Adv = 2 \u00d7 (Acc \u22120.5), (3) where Acc is the attack accuracy. It measures the advantage over random guessing: random guessing remains at 0, while a perfect attack gives 1. Other MIA studies [5, 46] have used more fine-grained met- rics, such as true positive rate (TPR) at low false positive rate (FPR), to precisely compare different MIA attacks. However, as the first MIA study on LLM RecSys, our focus is to show whether there are effective MIA attacks on the LLM RecSys approach. Thus, attack advantage is sufficient. Experiment Design. Each dataset is de-duplicated and randomly partitioned into two disjoint subsets: the member set and the non-member set. For each trial, a number of samples, i.e., the \u201cshots\u201d are ran- domly drawn from the member set to form the system prompt, one of which is selected as the member sam- ple, while a random sample from the non-member set serves as the non-member. Repeating this pro- cess 500 times results in a balanced evaluation set consisting of 500 member and 500 non-member sam- ples. We also simulate the RecSys system prompts with a different number",
    "selected as the member sam- ple, while a random sample from the non-member set serves as the non-member. Repeating this pro- cess 500 times results in a balanced evaluation set consisting of 500 member and 500 non-member sam- ples. We also simulate the RecSys system prompts with a different number of shots to investigate the relationship between the system prompt setting vs at- tack effectiveness. The 500 independent experiments for each setting, i.e., the specific LLM and the num- ber of shots, ensure the statistical significance of our findings. 6.2 Result Analysis Our experimental results show that the two attacks: direct inquiry and poisoning attacks work effectively, while the other two: hallucination and similarity at- tacks are unsatisfactory. We organize them in the same order. Meanwhile, we found that several factors affect the effectiveness of the attacks, including the number of shots used by the system prompt, the position of the attacked shot in the system prompt, and different LLMs. For each attack, we will explore these impor- tant factors. 6.2.1 Direct Inquiry We find Direct Inquiry works surprisingly well on Llama-3, which likely memorizes and utilizes the prompts better than older models. Older models, Llama-2 and Vicuna, do not work in this attack. Fig- ure 8 shows the comparison on the most effective case: one-shot system prompt. For other settings, the older models give almost zero attack advantage and thus ignored. Both older models tend to blindly give the same answer regardless of whether the sample is a member or nonmember. As this attack fully depends on the basic generative ability and prompt memo- rization of the LLM, it makes sense that newer LLMs may be more vulnerable to this attack. Llama-3 Vicuna Llama-2 0 0.5 1 Attack Advantage Movie Music Figure 8: Best Direct Inquery performance for each LLM and dataset. Figure 9 shows more details about this attack on both datasets with Llama-3. The attack performance is also affected by the number of shots used by the sys- tem prompt, and the shot position that contains the targeted user. Interestingly, the more shots used by 8 the system prompt, the less likely this attack will succeed, which implies that the system designer can simply increase the shots to make the RecSys more resilient to this type of attack. The targeted shot po- sition also plays a role in attack results. \u201cMovie-first\u201d in the figure means the victim happens to be at the first position of the system prompt. The victim at the earlier shot positions seems more vulnerable than later ones. 1-shot 5-shot 10-shot 0 0.5 1 Attack Advantage Movie-first Movie-last Music-first Music-last Figure 9: Attack advantage of direct inquiry against Llama-3 with different shot counts and",

This attack has a unique ad- ditional factor: the number of poisoned items, which are crafted by the attacker in the additional attacker- provided prompt. We find that both the number of shots in system prompts and the number of poisoned items in attacker\u2019s prompts affect the attack perfor- mance. Interestingly, different datasets may show dif- ferent affecting patterns, possibly due to the dataset- related topic and its relevant content in the origi- nal pre-training dataset. Similar to the first experi- ment, we experimented with 1-shot, 5-shot, and 10- shot system prompts. In addition, we investigated 2- poison, 5-poison, and 8-poison items in the attacker\u2019s prompts. With a similarity gap threshold \u03c4 around 0.3 to 0.45, we can achieve satisfactory MIA perfor- mance. Figure 10 summarizes the best performing MIA result under all settings for each LLM and each dataset. Different from the previous attack, an old- version LLM, Llama-2, shows the best performance for both datasets. We look into the Llama-2 results in more detail. Since the poisoning process randomly takes a number of items to poison, we do not distinguish the effect of Llama-2 Llama-3 Vicuna 0 0.5 1 Attack Advantage Movie Music Figure 10: Best attack advantage under poisoning for different models and domains poisoning the first or the last shot. Figure 11 on the movie dataset shows that more poisoned items may slightly increase the chance of MIA success, while more shots may reduce the MIA performance. Fig- ure 12 on the music dataset shows that the number of shots has more significant effect on MIA: the more shots, the worse MIA performs, while the pattern of the number of poisoned items is unclear. 1-shot 5-shot 10-shot 0.6 0.8 1 Attack Advantage 2-poisoned 5-poisoned 8-poisoned Figure 11: Poisoning Attack advantage for Llama-2 on movie dataset with k-shots in the system prompt and m number of poisoned items provided by the at- tacker.

Figure 15 shows the best result for each LLM and dataset. Llama-2 performs the best on the movie dataset, but only achieves around 0.23 advantage. The second best is Vicuna on movie, around 0.15. The other items are slightly above 0. Llama-2 Vicuna Llama-3 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 Attack Advantage Movie Music Figure 15: Llama-2 is the most vulnerable in the sim- ilarity attack. However, this attack overall performs the worst among other attacks. The similarity attack on traditional RecSys [42] utilizes the item embeddings derived from the in- teraction matrix to achieve good attacking perfor- mance. While such a known RecSys-specific embed- ding scheme is a very strong assumption, our poor similarity attack performance indicates that the gen- eral text embedding scheme may not have the infor- mation that the interaction-based embedding has. 6.3 Discussion In our initial study of the novel MIAs on LLM-based",
    "mance. While such a known RecSys-specific embed- ding scheme is a very strong assumption, our poor similarity attack performance indicates that the gen- eral text embedding scheme may not have the infor- mation that the interaction-based embedding has. 6.3 Discussion In our initial study of the novel MIAs on LLM-based RecSys, we have identified that at least two effective attacks: direct inquiry and poisoning. They perform 10 surprisingly well on the well-known public RecSys datasets. However, the use of different versions of LLMs leads to diverse results, which is partially tied to the match between the nature of the attack and the features of different versions of LLMs. For example, the direct inquiry attack utilizes the prompt memo- rization feature and the generalization power of the LLMs, the later models may give better performance. However, this type of attacks can be easily mitigated via model alignment, i.e., fine-tuning the model not to answer such kind of queries. The poisoning attack somehow utilizes the weakness, i.e., the memoriza- tion ability of older LLMs and thus these LLMs are more vulnerable to this attack. Recent LLMs have likely incorporated various techniques [20, 35] to ad- dress the memorization issue and thus less influenced by such attacks. The hallucination attack performs unsatisfactorily. Our results were almost against our initial design hy- pothesis: the seen information may lead to less hallu- cination. This indeed happened for a few cases, e.g., older models, like Llama-2 that likely has stronger memorization and hallucination, but the attack ad- vantage is marginal. The similarity attack performs badly. It is partly due to the significant difference between the general text embedding and the interaction-matrix based embed- ding. However, it also leaves space for improvement. There might be a better similarity attack to achieve performance comparable to our top ranked attacks. 7 Conclusion With LLMs potentially used for developing next- generation RecSys, the new privacy risks should be thoroughly understood. We designed four novel MIA attacks, specifically targeting LLM-based RecSys, and have shown that at least two of the attacks: di- rect inquiry and poisoning work effectively. Thus, we confirm that the membership inference threat on LLM-based RecSys is realistic. Practitioners and researchers of LLM RecSys should carefully design schemes to address such privacy threats. We will also extend this study to more MIA attacks and design corresponding mitigation methods. References [1] Imdb, 2024. [2] Musicbrainz, 2024.

    "EMOTION OMNI: ENABLING EMPATHETIC SPEECH RESPONSE GENERATION THROUGH LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS Haoyu Wang\u22c6\u2020 Guangyan Zhang\u2020 Jiale Chen\u22c6 Jingyu Li\u2020 Yuehai Wang\u22c6 Yiwen Guo\u2021 \u22c6Zhejiang University \u2020 LIGHTSPEED \u2021 Independent Researcher ABSTRACT With the development of speech large language models (speech LLMs), users can now interact directly with assistants via speech. However, most existing models simply convert the response con- tent into speech without fully understanding the rich emotional and paralinguistic cues embedded in the user\u2019s query. In many cases, the same sentence can have different meanings depending on the emotional expression. Furthermore, emotional understanding is essential for improving user experience in human-machine interac- tion. Currently, most speech LLMs with empathetic capabilities are trained on massive datasets. This approach requires vast amounts of data and significant computational resources. Therefore, a key challenge lies in how to develop a speech LLM capable of gener- ating empathetic responses with limited data and without the need for large-scale training. To address this challenge, we propose Emo- tion Omni, a novel model architecture designed to understand the emotional content of user speech input and generate empathetic speech responses. Additionally, we developed a data generation pipeline based on an open-source TTS framework to construct a 200k emotional dialogue dataset, which supports the construction of an empathetic speech assistant. The demos are available at https://w311411.github.io/omni_demo/. Index Terms\u2014 Speech LLM, omni, emotional speech, speech assistant 1. INTRODUCTION With the emergence of groundbreaking technologies such as GPT- 4o [1], the integration between speech capabilities and large lan- guage models (LLMs) has dramatically enhanced user experience, significantly expanding their practical applications across diverse scenarios ranging from customer service and educational platforms to personal assistants and therapeutic interventions. Several inno- vative end-to-end multimodal voice interaction models have been developed, including Mini-Omni [2], LLaMA-Omni [3], and Vo- calNet [4], which represent a paradigm shift by eliminating the traditional pipeline approach that relies on separate speech-to-text transcription processes. Instead, these models achieve direct, fast generation of both textual and speech responses from voice com- mands, streamlining the interaction flow and reducing latency. However, beyond simple semantic question answering, speech interaction heavily relies on a deep understanding of paralinguis- tic information [5, 6]. Paralinguistic features, such as the speaker\u2019s emotions and intentions, play a crucial role in daily conversations, greatly affecting the delivery and response to the information. The same sentence, when expressed with different emotions, conveys en- tirely different meanings, which requires speech LLMs to accurately interpret the user\u2019s emotional intent and generate appropriate em- pathetic responses. Otherwise, the speech interaction system may misunderstand the user\u2019s intent or respond inappropriately, leading to a significant decrease in user experience.

Otherwise, the speech interaction system may misunderstand the user\u2019s intent or respond inappropriately, leading to a significant decrease in user experience. This challenge becomes particularly pronounced in applications re- quiring high emotional intelligence, such as mental health support, customer service, and educational tutoring, where empathetic com- munication is essential for building trust and rapport. Inspired by the advances of prosodic and emotional natural speech dialogue systems [7\u20139], recent speech language models (SLMs) focus on generating empathetic responses [10, 11]. How- ever, most of these remain rely on large datasets. To address this issue, we propose an innovative end-to-end ar- chitecture that directly utilizes the emotional features in speech to recognize and precisely control the generation of empathetic speech LLMs. By inputting both the emotional and semantic features of the speech, we can generate not only the content of the speech re- sponses but also the emotional features required to control the tone and emotion of the speech output. This approach avoids the biases that may exist in text descriptions and allows for a more detailed un- derstanding of the emotional variations within the speech. Further- more, by leveraging open-source TTS frameworks and an efficient pipeline design, we have constructed a low-cost, scalable emotional dialogue dataset, significantly reducing the need for manual labeling and lowering the costs of building emotional dialogue systems. The contributions are as followed: \u2022 Developed an emotion-driven speech LLM: Our speech LLM not only recognizes the user\u2019s emotional intent but also generates corresponding empathetic speech responses, sig- nificantly enhancing the system\u2019s ability to understand and respond to emotions. \u2022 Built an efficient emotional dialogue dataset generation pipeline: We designed and implemented a pipeline for gen- erating emotional dialogue datasets, greatly reducing the cost of developing emotional speech systems and minimizing re- liance on large amounts of manually labeled data. Through these innovations, we have successfully built a low- cost, efficient, and reproducible empathetic speech LLM, signif- icantly reducing the required training data and computational re- sources, and providing a flexible and efficient solution for future empathetic speech interaction systems. arXiv:2508.18655v1 [cs.CL] 26 Aug 2025 Fig. 1. Model Architecture and Training Process. In Stage 1, we fine-tune the LLM backbone with LoRA to align speech and text, focusing on understanding speech cues and generating empathetic responses.

In Stage 2.1, the text embeddings are input to the speech decoder to train basic speech generation. In Stage 2.2, the gated fusion module combines LLM hidden states, text embeddings, and emotional cues for better quality. 2. METHODS Similar to LLaMA Omni [3], we utilize pre-trained speech and emo- tion encoders to extract semantic and emotional features from input speech, facilitating alignment learning between the speech and text modalities of the LLM. Subsequently, we leverage the LLM\u2019s output hidden states to predict the sequential emotional features of the re- sponse speech and explicitly output emotional instructions for the response. Before inputting to the speech decoder, the LLM hid- den states are fused with text embeddings and modulated by the predicted emotional features, enabling the speech decoder to au- toregressively generate speech tokens with target emotions. These tokens are then converted into speech waveforms through a flow matching model [12] and HiFiGAN [13], both optimally designed for efficient streaming decoding. 2.1. Speech Encoder We use Whisper-large-v3 [14] as the speech semantic encoder to extract comprehensive linguistic content from speech signals. How- ever, since Whisper primarily captures semantic information while lacking comprehensive emotional understanding capabilities, we ad- ditionally employ the pre-trained Emotion2Vec [15] as the emotional feature encoder to capture paralinguistic emotional information and provide complementary affective cues that are essential for empa- thetic speech interaction. This dual-encoder architecture allows our model to process both the semantic content and emotional context of user speech simultaneously. Both pre-trained models extract and downsample speech features from the user\u2019s speech input S: Hsem/emo = Dsem/emo(Esem/emo(S), k) (1) where Esem/emo denotes the Whisper/Emotion2Vec encoders respectively, Dsem/emo are the corresponding downsampling adapters responsible for downsampling the encoded features to 10Hz to re- duce sequence length and improve computational efficiency, and k is the downsampling factor used to control the degree of tem- poral resolution reduction. To preserve the original performance of the pre-trained models and ensure training stability, the encoder parameters remain frozen throughout the entire training process. We concatenate the semantic and emotional features along the feature dimension to create a unified representation that captures both linguistic content and emotional context. This combined fea- ture vector is then projected through a linear transformation to match the LLM hidden size, which is subsequently used as the input to the large language model for generating contextually appropriate and emotionally aware responses. 2.2. Large Language Model We choose Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct [16] as the LLM backbone, which possesses strong language understanding and generation capabilities and has achieved good alignment with human preferences through instruction tuning.

To ensure empathetic speech responses, we design an emotion prediction head that leverages the LLM\u2019s hidden states to predict the emotional features of the response speech. This ensures that the re- sponses are both semantically appropriate and emotionally aligned with the user\u2019s input. We first extract frame-level emotional features from the response speech using an emotion encoder. To align these features with the LLM output, we downsample them using a window averaging method, adjusting their length to match the LLM output sequence. The LLM\u2019s hidden states are then passed to the emotion prediction head, which predicts the target emotional features. This process enables precise control over the emotional tone of the gen- erated speech, ensuring it aligns with the user\u2019s emotional needs. Htarget emo [j] = 1 w jw X i=(j\u22121)w+1 Hresponse emo [i], j = 1, 2, . . . , L (3) where w is the average window size, and Htarget emo \u2208RL\u00d7De is the downsampled response emotional features. The emotion prediction head maps the LLM\u2019s hidden states to the emotional feature space: \u02c6 Hemo = EmoPredictHead(Hout) \u2208RL\u00d7De (4) The total model loss function includes text generation loss and emotion prediction loss: Ltotal = LLLM + \u03bbLemo, and the emotion prediction loss is: Lemotion = MSE( \u02c6 Hemotion, Htarget emo ) + \u03b1(1 \u2212CosSim( \u02c6 Hemotion, Htarget emo )) (5) where \u03bb and \u03b1 are hyperparameters that balance different loss terms, MSE(\u00b7) represents mean squared error loss, and CosSim(\u00b7) represents cosine similarity. Through this joint training approach, the model can generate text responses that are both semantically co- herent and emotionally consistent. 2.3. Speech Decoder To generate speech responses, we refer to the speech tokenizer from CosyVoice2 [17], which discretizes continuous speech signals into discrete speech units. This",
    "CosSim(\u00b7) represents cosine similarity. Through this joint training approach, the model can generate text responses that are both semantically co- herent and emotionally consistent. 2.3. Speech Decoder To generate speech responses, we refer to the speech tokenizer from CosyVoice2 [17], which discretizes continuous speech signals into discrete speech units. This tokenizer discretizes continuous speech features into speech token sequences by quantifying intermediate layer outputs from the Whisper encoder with Finite Scalar Quanti- zation (FSQ) [18]. Our validation shows that CosyVoice2 tokens re- tain emotional and paralinguistic features, which support emotional speech generation. When training the speech decoder, we first directly input the LLM label\u2019s text embeddings to build the basic speech generation capability. Then, we use a gate fusion module similar to LLaMA Omni 2 to fuse the text embeddings with the LLM hidden states, integrating semantic and contextual information. The gate fusion mechanism dynamically balances the contributions of text and con- textual features: GateFusion(Htext, Hout) = \u03b1 \u2299Htext + (1 \u2212\u03b1) \u2299Hout (6) where \u03b1 = \u03c3(Wg[Htext, Hout] + bg) is the gating weight com- puted via a sigmoid function over the concatenated features. This two-stage approach allows the former to help us precisely align text and speech, while the latter provides rich contextual information, ef- fectively improving the quality of autoregressive speech generation. To achieve emotional control, we introduce AdaLN (Adaptive Layer Normalization) [19]. Compared to traditional layer normal- ization, AdaLN dynamically adjusts the scaling and shifting param- eters during the normalization process based on input emotional fea- tures, allowing the generated speech to better convey emotional in- formation, thus enhancing the model\u2019s flexibility and adaptability in emotional generation. The effectiveness of AdaLN in information fusion is validated in [20]. The fused features are then adjusted for emotional style through AdaLN: Hadapted = AdaLN(GateFusion(Htext, Hout), \u02c6 Hemo) (7) where the emotional AdaLN is defined as: AdaLN(hi, ei) = \u03b3(ei) \u2299hi \u2212\u00b5(hi) \u03c3(hi) + \u03b2(ei) (8) where \u03b3(e) and \u03b2(e) are scaling and shift parameters predicted from emotional features, \u00b5(x) and \u03c3(x) denote the mean and stan- dard deviation of the input, and \u2299indicates element-wise multipli- cation. Subsequently, the speech decoder, comprising four layers of the LLM decoder, processes the emotionally adaptive hiddens to gener- ate target emotional speech token sequences. This design allows the model to dynamically modulate the speech generation process based on the predicted emotional cues, ensuring the generation of emotion- ally consistent speech responses. The resulting speech tokens are then converted into waveforms using the pre-trained vocoder from CosyVoice2. 3. EXPERIMENTS 3.1.

Datasets Given the scarcity of emotional dialogue speech datasets and the high cost of constructing large-scale annotated emotional speech data, we propose an innovative data generation method that com- bines GPT-4o and CosyVoice2 to build a high-quality emotional dialogue speech dataset. We leverage GPT-4o\u2019s powerful text gener- ation capabilities to create user queries spanning 20 different appli- cation domains including education, healthcare, customer service, and entertainment, with explicit emotional labels (such as happiness, sadness, anger, anxiety, etc.), then generate corresponding empa- thetic responses based on these queries to ensure rich emotional expression and appropriate empathetic feedback in the dialogue content. Subsequently, we employ the CosyVoice2 speech synthesis model with ten different speakers (five male and five female) to synthesize emotionally adaptive speech using these emotional labels as precise control directives, ensuring both speaker diversity and corresponding affective characteristics, ultimately generating 150k high-quality emotional dialogue speech pairs. Additionally, to further enrich the diversity and authenticity of the dataset, we carefully curated 50k dialogue samples with clear emotional content and natural conversational characteristics from the VoiceAssistant dataset [4], employing text-based emotion classifica- tion for rigorous filtering to ensure the selected samples possess clear Model VoiceBench Speech Quality Alpaca \u2191 Common \u2191 IFEval \u2191 WildVoice \u2191 SD-QA \u2191 UTMOS \u2191 Qwen2-Audio [21] 3.74 3.43 26.33 3.01 35.71 - Moshi [22] 2.01 1.60 10.12 1.30 15.64 3.81 GLM-4-Voice [10] 3.97 3.42 25.92 3.18 25.92 3.48 LLama-Omni [3] 3.70 3.46 14.87 2.92 39.69 3.98 Ours 3.84 3.47 27.89 3.13 36.87 4.41 Table 1.

Training As illustrated in Figure 1, the training process consists of two stages, both utilizing the emotional QA 200k dataset we constructed. In the first stage, we fine-tune the LLM backbone using LoRA and simulta- neously train the downsampling adapters to achieve effective align- ment between speech and text modalities.

Concurrently, we train an emotion prediction head composed of linear layers to predict the corresponding emotional features of speech from the LLM\u2019s output responses. This stage focuses on learning to understand speech and emotional cues in the user\u2019s input and generate empathetic textual responses. In Stage 2.1, we directly use the embeddings of response text as input to the speech decoder to train the foundational speech gener- ation capability. This approach allows the model to learn the ba- sic mapping between textual semantic content and corresponding speech representations, establishing a solid foundation for speech synthesis. In Stage 2.2, the gated fusion module is enabled to fuse the hidden states output by the LLM and text embeddings, thereby acquiring richer contextual information and further enhancing the quality and emotional expressiveness of generated speech responses. Throughout the speech generation process, emotional control is achieved through Adaptive Layer Normalization (AdaLN). 4. RESULTS We employ subsets of VoiceBench [23] as a benchmark to evalu- ate the model\u2019s performance in speech-based question answering, utilizing the alpacaeval, commoneval, wildvoice, and ifeval subsets. These subsets assess the model\u2019s ability to understand and execute various spoken commands. We also use UTMOS [24] to evaluate the quality of generated speech. The results are presented in Table 1. Furthermore, we constructed 1,000 emotional test question- answer pairs to evaluate emotional consistency between textual and speech responses. We input the speech transcriptions with their emotion labels, along with the model\u2019s response emotion labels and content into GPT for evaluation. This assesses whether responses match input emotions, appropriately address user emotional needs, and maintain consistency across text and speech modalities using a 1-5 point scale. To examine speech-text alignment, we transcribe speech using Whisper-large-v3 and compute Word Error Rate. We also conducted an emotional MOS evaluation to assess empathetic effectiveness. Results are shown in Table 2. The experimental results demonstrate that our model effectively processes speech input while maintaining its original capabilities. More importantly, it accurately recognizes emotional information in user speech and generates corresponding emotional responses in both modalities. This enables strong performance in multimodal emotional interaction tasks. However, challenges remain when pro- cessing speech with subtle or weak emotional intensity. In such cases, the model may focus on semantic content and overlook par- alinguistic cues, leading to mismatched emotional responses. There- fore, improving performance with low emotional intensity speech remains an important research direction. 5.

    "There- fore, improving performance with low emotional intensity speech remains an important research direction. 5. CONCLUSIONS In this study, we present Emotion Omni, a speech LLM designed to recognize speech input and generate empathetic responses. Our model effectively processes semantic and emotional features, en- abling emotionally coherent responses across text and speech modal- ities. By introducing a cost-effective emotional dialogue dataset gen- eration pipeline, we reduce dependency on large-scale labeled data, making empathetic speech system development more accessible. The model\u2019s ability to generate high-quality empathetic speech with limited resources opens possibilities for scalable emotion-aware in- teraction systems. While results are encouraging, challenges remain with subtle emotional tones. The model may prioritize semantic content over emotional cues, reducing response accuracy. Future work will focus on enhancing sensitivity to low-intensity emotions and optimizing the semantic-emotional balance. This research es- tablishes a foundation for developing more accessible and efficient empathetic speech generation systems. 6.

    "UniC-RAG: Universal Knowledge Corruption Attacks to Retrieval-Augmented Generation Runpeng Geng, Yanting Wang, Ying Chen, Jinyuan Jia Pennsylvania State University {runpeng, yanting, yingchen, jinyuan}@psu.edu Abstract Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are widely deployed in real-world applications in diverse domains such as finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. However, many studies showed that they are vulnerable to knowledge corruption attacks, where an attacker can inject adversarial texts into the knowledge database of a RAG system to induce the LLM to generate attacker-desired outputs. Existing studies mainly focus on attacking specific queries or queries with similar topics (or keywords). In this work, we propose UniC-RAG, a universal knowledge corruption attack against RAG systems. Unlike prior work, UniC-RAG jointly optimizes a small number of adversarial texts that can simultaneously attack a large number of user queries with diverse topics and domains, enabling an attacker to achieve various malicious objectives, such as directing users to malicious websites, triggering harmful command execution, or launching denial-of-service attacks. We formulate UniC-RAG as an optimization problem and further design an effective solution to solve it, including a balanced similarity-based clustering method to enhance the attack\u2019s effectiveness. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that UniC-RAG is highly effective and significantly outperforms baselines. For instance, UniC-RAG could achieve over 90% attack success rate by injecting 100 adversarial texts into a knowledge database with millions of texts to simultaneously attack a large set of user queries (e.g., 2,000 queries). Additionally, we evaluate existing defenses and show that they are insufficient to defend against UniC-RAG, highlighting the need for new defense mechanisms in RAG systems. 1 Introduction Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems such as Bing Copilot [1], SearchGPT [2], and Google Search with AI Overviews [3] are widely deployed in the real world. There are also many open-source RAG frameworks, such as LlamaIn- dex [4], LangChain [5], and ChatRTX [6] that enable developers and researchers to build customized RAG systems for various applications. In general, a RAG system contains three major components: knowledge database, retriever, and LLM. A knowledge database consists of many texts (e.g., millions of texts) collected from diverse sources such as Wikipedia [7]. Given a query (or a question) from a user, a retriever will search for a set of the most relevant texts from the knowledge database. The retrieved texts are used as the context for an LLM to generate a response to the user\u2019s query. Many recent studies [8\u201325] showed that RAG systems are vulnerable to knowledge corruption attacks. Specifically, an attacker can inject adversarial texts into the knowledge database of a RAG system to induce an LLM to generate attacker-desired responses for user queries. For instance, when the knowledge database is collected from Wikipedia, an attacker can maliciously edit Wikipedia pages to inject",
    "vulnerable to knowledge corruption attacks. Specifically, an attacker can inject adversarial texts into the knowledge database of a RAG system to induce an LLM to generate attacker-desired responses for user queries. For instance, when the knowledge database is collected from Wikipedia, an attacker can maliciously edit Wikipedia pages to inject adversarial texts [8, 26]. In general, existing attacks [8\u201325] on RAG systems mainly focus on 1) a particular user query such as \u201cWho is the CEO of OpenAI?\u201d [8\u201312], 2) a set of similar queries (e.g., queries on a specific topic or with similar keywords) [13\u201315], and 3) queries that contain an attacker-chosen backdoor trigger [16\u201320]. However, attacking a universal and broad scope of user queries remains unexplored. We aim to bridge this gap by introducing UniC-RAG, a universal knowledge corruption attack against RAG systems. Our work. In this work, we study a more universal and scalable attack scenario where an attacker crafts adversarial texts targeting a large set of diverse, attacker-chosen queries (denoted as Q ). Unlike existing studies [8\u201315], which focus on attacking specific or similar queries, our approach aims to compromise a large number of user queries (e.g., hundreds or even thousands of user queries) that span a wide range of topics, domains, and linguistic expressions. 1 We consider that an attacker aims to inject adversarial texts into the knowledge database of a RAG system. As a result, the LLM in RAG generates responses satisfying an attacker-chosen, arbitrary, yet universal attack objective for queries in Q . Achieving this goal allows the attacker to pursue various malicious purposes in practice. For instance, an attacker can make an LLM generate a refusal answer [9] such as \u201cSorry, I cannot provide information about your question\u201d for any queries from Q , thereby degrading the utility of a RAG system. This form of denial-of-service attack could disrupt critical applications, such as customer support chatbots [27], academic research assistants [28], or medical AI applications [29], reducing their effectiveness. Moreover, the attacker can also induce an LLM to generate responses containing a malicious URL (e.g., \u201cwww.universalrag.com\u201d) for queries from Q . By directing users to the attacker-controlled websites, the attacker could harvest sensitive credentials, distribute malware, or manipulate users into making fraudulent transactions. This type of attack is particularly dangerous in domains where users rely on AI-generated content for trusted information, such as legal or financial AI tools [30\u201332]. Overview of UniC-RAG. The major challenge for an attacker is to craft a small number of adversarial texts to attack a large number of user queries simultaneously. For instance, prior studies [8\u201311] have explored knowledge corruption attacks where each adversarial text targets a single query. When extending these methods to our scenario, they",
    "The major challenge for an attacker is to craft a small number of adversarial texts to attack a large number of user queries simultaneously. For instance, prior studies [8\u201311] have explored knowledge corruption attacks where each adversarial text targets a single query. When extending these methods to our scenario, they either require injecting a large number of adversarial texts or result in suboptimal attack performance (as shown in our experimental results). The reason is that they optimize adversarial texts for each user query independently. To address this challenge, we jointly optimize adversarial texts across a set of diverse user queries. Specifically, the idea of UniC-RAG is to partition the set of user queries in Q into smaller groups and optimize a separate adversarial text for each group of queries. The key difficulty lies in determining how to partition Q effectively. A straightforward strategy is to randomly divide the queries in Q into disjoint groups. However, the queries in each group can be very diverse (e.g., spanning different topics and domains), which can reduce the effectiveness of the optimized adversarial text. In particular, the adversarial text may be effective for certain queries in the group but ineffective against others. In response, another strategy is to use K-means to cluster user queries based on their embedding vectors produced by a retriever, thereby grouping semantically similar queries together. The key insight is that if a group of queries is semantically similar, it becomes possible to craft an adversarial text that is similar to all of them. Thus, the adversarial text can be retrieved for all these queries in the group, allowing the attacker to scale the attack without injecting many adversarial texts. However, K-means can result in imbalanced group sizes: some groups contain (much) more queries than others. As a result, the optimized adversarial text can be less effective for groups with many queries, thereby reducing the overall effectiveness of attacks (as shown in our results). To address the issue, we design a new clustering method to partition a large query set Q into smaller groups based on semantic similarity, ensuring that 1) queries within each group are highly similar to each other, and 2) the group sizes are balanced and comparable to each other. Then, for each group, UniC-RAG optimizes an adversarial text to achieve two goals. The first goal is that the adversarial text can be retrieved for the queries in the group. UniC-RAG employs an optimization-based method [33] to reach this goal. The second goal is that the adversarial text can mislead an LLM to generate a response satisfying the attacker-chosen objective. UniC-RAG provides a generic framework and can incorporate diverse techniques such as prompt injection [34\u201339] to achieve the",

The second goal is that the adversarial text can mislead an LLM to generate a response satisfying the attacker-chosen objective. UniC-RAG provides a generic framework and can incorporate diverse techniques such as prompt injection [34\u201339] to achieve the second goal. Evaluation of UniC-RAG. We conduct systematic evaluations of UniC-RAG on 4 question-answering datasets: Natural Question (NQ) [40], HotpotQA [41], MS-MARCO [42], and a dataset (called Wikipedia) we constructed to simulate real-world RAG systems using Wikipedia dump [7]. We also conduct a comprehensive ablation study containing 4 RAG retrievers, 7 LLMs varying in architectures and scales (e.g., Llama3 [43], GPT-4o [44]), and different hyperparameters of UniC-RAG. We adopt Retrieval Success Rate (RSR) and Attack Success Rate (ASR) as evaluation metrics. RSR quantifies the proportion of queries whose retrieved texts contain at least one adversarial text, while ASR measures the proportion that yield attacker-desired responses. Our results demonstrate that UniC-RAG could achieve over 90% RSRs and ASRs by injecting 100 adversarial texts into databases with millions of texts to simultaneously attack 500-2,000 queries. Besides, UniC-RAG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines [8, 9, 37, 45]. Defending against UniC-RAG. We evaluate several defenses, including paraphrasing [46], expanding content window [8], and robust RAG systems [47\u201350]. Our results show these defense mechanisms are insufficient to defend against UniC-RAG, highlighting the need for new defenses. Our major contributions are summarized as follows: \u2022 We propose UniC-RAG, a universal knowledge corruption attack to RAG systems. UniC-RAG enables an attacker to simultaneously attack diverse user queries with a small number of adversarial texts to achieve different malicious objectives. \u2022 We formulate UniC-RAG as an optimization problem and solve it by proposing a balanced similarity-based clustering and leveraging a gradient-based optimization method. We also introduce a greedy initialization technique to further improve performance. \u2022 We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of UniC-RAG on multiple datasets. Our results demonstrate that UniC-RAG is consistently effective under different settings and outperforms baselines. 2 \u2022 We evaluate several defense mechanisms against UniC-RAG, and our results demonstrate that these defenses are insufficient, highlighting the need for new defenses. 2 Background and Related Work 2.1 RAG Systems Overview of RAG systems. A RAG system consists of three major components: a knowledge database, a retriever, and an LLM. The knowledge database contains a large collection of texts aggregated from diverse sources such as Wikipedia [51] or up-to-date newsletters [52]. For simplicity, we denote the knowledge database as D = {S1,S2,...,Sd}, where Si represents the i-th text in the database. Given a user query q, the RAG system retrieves a set of relevant texts from D and then conditions an LLM on the retrieved texts to generate a",
    "newsletters [52]. For simplicity, we denote the knowledge database as D = {S1,S2,...,Sd}, where Si represents the i-th text in the database. Given a user query q, the RAG system retrieves a set of relevant texts from D and then conditions an LLM on the retrieved texts to generate a response. The process consists of two key steps: Step I\u2013Text Retrieval. The retriever is responsible for identifying the most relevant texts from a knowledge database for a given query. In general, the retriever R is an encoder model that encodes texts into embedding vectors. Some retrievers [53] may contain two different encoder models, one for user query q and one for texts in the database Si, while other retrievers [54, 55] only contain one model for both queries and texts. For simplicity, we assume the retriever only has one encoder model, denoted as E. Based on our experimental results in Section 5.3, our proposed method could also generalize to retrievers with multiple encoder models. The similarity between a query q and a text Si is computed as Sim(E(q),E(Si)), where Sim(\u00b7,\u00b7) is a similarity function (e.g., cosine similarity, dot product). The retriever selects the top-k texts from D with the highest similarity scores to query q to form the retrieved set, which is denoted as R (q;D). Step II\u2013Response Generation. After retrieving the top-k texts R (q;D), the LLM generates a response to q conditioned on these retrieved texts as context. Specifically, given a system prompt (detailed in Appendix A), the LLM takes the query q along with the retrieved texts as input and produces an answer: f(q,R (q;D)), where f is an LLM and we omit the system prompt for simplicity. This process enables the LLM to generate responses grounded in retrieved texts from knowledge database D. 2.2 Existing Attacks on RAG Systems Over the past year, several attacks on RAG systems have been proposed. These attacks can be broadly categorized into three types: single-query attacks [8\u201312], multiple-query attacks [13\u201315], and backdoor attacks [16\u201320]. Single-query attacks. In single-query attacks, an attacker injects adversarial texts into the knowledge database, aiming to manipulate the responses of a RAG system to specific target queries [8\u201312]. In such attacks, each injected adversarial text only targets a single query. For instance, Zou et al. [8] proposed PoisonedRAG, where the attacker injects adversarial texts into the knowledge database to manipulate the LLM into generating an attacker-chosen response (e.g., \u201cTim Cook\u201d) for a specific query (e.g., \u201cWho is the CEO of OpenAI?\u201d). PoisonedRAG can be viewed as a disinformation attack to RAG systems. Besides, Shafran et al. [9] proposed Jamming, a denial-of-service attack that prevents RAG systems from answering specific queries. In general, these attacks aim to",

Besides, Shafran et al. [9] proposed Jamming, a denial-of-service attack that prevents RAG systems from answering specific queries. In general, these attacks aim to make the LLM in a RAG system generate an attacker-desired response for each target query. Therefore, they optimize adversarial texts independently for each query. By contrast, in our work, we aim to make an LLM generate attacker-desired responses for diverse user queries. Due to such a difference, these existing attacks achieve a sub-optimal performance when extended to our scenario, as demonstrated in our experimental results. Multiple-query attacks. In multiple-query attacks, an attacker aims to manipulate a set of similar queries (e.g. queries on a specific topic, such as reviews of Harry Potter [14]) or queries containing related keywords (e.g. Potter) by injecting adversarial texts into the knowledge database. Tan et al. [13] proposed LIAR, an attack that injects adversarial texts designed to be retrieved for a set of semantically similar queries. Zhong et al. [45] proposed the Corpus Poisoning attack, which optimizes adversarial texts such that they can be retrieved for general user queries. Ben et al. [14] proposed GASLITEing, which optimizes adversarial texts to be retrieved for topic-specific queries. In general, their idea is to extend Corpus Poisoning [45] by introducing attacker-designed harmful information to not only compromise the retrieval, but also get attacker-desired responses from the RAG system. To evaluate the effectiveness of such attacks, we also extend Corpus Poisoning to our experiment scenario as a baseline. Our results demonstrate that the extended Corpus Poisoning achieves sub-optimal performance. Backdoor attacks. In backdoor attacks, an attacker embeds backdoor triggers into adversarial texts and injects them into the knowledge database of a RAG system [16\u201320]. These adversarial texts remain inactive under normal conditions but are retrieved when a user query contains the corresponding backdoor trigger, thereby activating the attack. For instance, Cheng et al. [16] 3 proposed TrojanRAG, where the attacker fine-tunes a retriever model to bind backdoor triggers with adversarial texts, ensuring they could be retrieved when specific triggers appear in user queries. Xue et al. [17] introduced BadRAG, which leverages contrastive learning to optimize adversarial texts so that they are retrieved only by queries containing the backdoor trigger and remain undetected by other queries. Moreover, Chaudhari et al. [18] proposed Phantom, a stealthy backdoor attack that ensures adversarial documents are retrieved exclusively when a query contains a predefined trigger. These backdoor attacks ensure that adversarial texts have high retrieval scores for queries containing the backdoor trigger while remaining undetectable for non-triggered queries.

    "[18] proposed Phantom, a stealthy backdoor attack that ensures adversarial documents are retrieved exclusively when a query contains a predefined trigger. These backdoor attacks ensure that adversarial texts have high retrieval scores for queries containing the backdoor trigger while remaining undetectable for non-triggered queries. Such attacks require target queries to contain backdoor triggers, which is different from our scenario where the attacker does not have control over user queries. Since these attacks rely on specific triggers to activate, they are fundamentally different from our setting, where adversarial texts must generalize across a broad scope of user queries. Therefore, we do not include backdoor attacks as baselines in our experiments. Difference between our work and existing studies. The key difference between our work and existing studies is that we focus on attacking more general and diverse user queries, whereas existing studies primarily target a single query or a predefined set of queries (e.g., semantically similar queries or queries containing a backdoor trigger). Due to this fundamental difference, we find that existing methods have limited effectiveness in achieving our goal. Our approach extends beyond these limitations by jointly optimizing adversarial texts to target a large number of user queries across a broad and diverse scope, significantly improving the attack\u2019s scalability and impact. 2.3 Existing Defenses Several defense mechanisms have been proposed to enhance the safety of RAG systems [8, 46\u201350, 56]. For instance, Jain et al. [46] proposed paraphrasing defense, which employs an LLM to rephrase user queries, reducing their similarity to adversarial texts in the database. Besides, Zou et al. [8] also discussed expanding the context window of the RAG system or removing duplicate texts from the knowledge database, which could be applied to mitigate potential harms in the RAG system. Moreover, several works [47\u201350, 56] proposed techniques to enhance the RAG system itself by improving the RAG pipeline or fine-tuning the LLM in the RAG system, making it robust to adversarial manipulations and reducing the risk of attacks. 3 Problem Formulation We first discuss the threat model and then formulate UniC-RAG as an optimization problem. 3.1 Threat Model We characterize the threat model with respect to the attacker\u2019s goals, background knowledge, and capabilities. Attacker\u2019s goals. Suppose Q is a set of user queries that an attacker is interested in. Specifically, Q could contain arbitrary queries that cover a diverse range of topics. Moreover, Q could have a large size (e.g., with 2,000 queries). We consider that an attacker aims to inject a small number of adversarial texts (e.g., 100 texts) into the knowledge database of a RAG system.

    "with 2,000 queries). We consider that an attacker aims to inject a small number of adversarial texts (e.g., 100 texts) into the knowledge database of a RAG system. As a result, when conditioned on the texts retrieved from the corrupted knowledge database, the LLM in the RAG system generates responses satisfying an attacker-chosen, arbitrary, yet universal objective (denoted as O) for queries in Q . Moreover, the adversarial texts should also be able to transfer to queries beyond those in Q , thereby enhancing their universality and generality. For instance, the injected adversarial texts should remain effective for paraphrased versions of queries in Q . Moreover, we also consider a more challenging scenario where the attacker does not know the user query set Q . Instead, the attacker can use another query set Q \u2032 to generate adversarial texts, and then perform a transfer attack to the unseen user query set Q . By selecting different objectives, an attacker can achieve various malicious purposes in practice. For instance, an attacker can embed a malicious link to answers for user queries, which can be used for phishing attempts. As a concrete example, an attacker may wish the responses produced by a RAG system contain the following information for user queries: \u201cYou have reached the access limit for this document, for more information, please visit www.universalrag.com.\u201d As a result, the user may be tricked into visiting the harmful website, enabling an attacker to exploit this for malicious purposes, such as credential theft, malware distribution, or financial fraud. The attacker (who can be the competitor of a RAG service provider) can also make an LLM in a target RAG system refuse to provide answers for queries in Q , thereby achieving denial-of-service effects. For instance, as shown in a previous study [9] on RAG security, an attacker may aim to make an LLM output \u201cSorry, I cannot provide information about your query.\u201d for queries in Q . Our attack objective is different from previous studies [8, 9, 13, 14, 17, 18, 45] on RAG attacks. In general, these studies aim to make a RAG system generate a query-dependent, incorrect answer to a specific query. By contrast, UniC-RAG aims to attack a 4 Who wins the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics?

We first partition user queries into balanced clusters based on semantic similarity between embedding vectors. Then, for each cluster, we optimize an adversarial text that is similar to all queries in the cluster (the centroid of the cluster in the embedding space). large query set Q and to let the RAG system generate harmful responses that satisfy a universal attack objective O for all queries in Q . Attacker\u2019s background knowledge and capabilities. We consider the attacker\u2019s background knowledge along three key dimensions of a RAG system: the knowledge database, the retriever, and the LLM. We assume the attacker has no access to the knowledge database, i.e., the attacker does not know any content and cannot retrieve texts from it by querying the RAG system. Following previous studies [8, 9, 13, 14, 16\u201318, 45], we assume the attacker has white-box access to the retriever used in the RAG system. This assumption is practical, as most state-of-the-art retriever models are open-source, enabling us to analyze and understand the worst-case scenario for knowledge corruption attacks. Additionally, we assume the attacker may or may not have access to the LLM in the RAG system. Following previous studies on attacks against RAG systems [8, 9, 13, 14, 17, 18, 45], we assume the attacker can inject adversarial texts into the knowledge database but cannot manipulate any other components of the RAG system, such as the parameters of the retriever and LLM. In this work, we consider a challenging setting where the number of injected adversarial texts is (much) smaller than the number of queries in Q . 3.2 Formulating UniC-RAG as an Optimization Problem Suppose Q is a set of m user queries (denoted as q1,q2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,qm). An attacker aims to craft n adversarial texts (denoted as P1,P2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,Pn) to achieve the aforementioned attacker\u2019s goal. We formally define the attack as follows: Definition 1. Suppose q \u2208Q is a user query from a query set Q . Besides, we use O to denote the objective of an attacker and use V (\u00b7,\u00b7) to denote an evaluation metric used to quantify whether the output of an LLM aligns with the attacker\u2019s objective O. An attacker aims to craft a set of n adversarial texts",
    "query set Q . Besides, we use O to denote the objective of an attacker and use V (\u00b7,\u00b7) to denote an evaluation metric used to quantify whether the output of an LLM aligns with the attacker\u2019s objective O. An attacker aims to craft a set of n adversarial texts \u0393 = {P1,P2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,Pn} by solving the following optimization problem: max \u0393 1 |Q| \u2211 q\u2208Q V (f(q;T (q)),O), s.t., T (q) = R (q;D \u222a\u0393), (1) where T (q) is a set of texts retrieved from a corrupted knowledge database D \u222a\u0393 for the query q, and f(q;T (q)) is the LLM output for query q based on retrieved texts T (q). 5 Challenges in solving the optimization problem in Equation (1). The key challenges in solving the optimization problem in Equation (1) are as follows. The first challenge is to ensure that T (q) contains adversarial texts, i.e., adversarial texts in \u0393 can be retrieved by as many queries q \u2208Q as possible. The technical challenge here is that an attacker may wish to use a small number of adversarial texts to attack a large number of queries. Consequently, each adversarial text should be able to attack multiple queries simultaneously. The second challenge is to ensure that the retrieved adversarial texts in T (q) successfully induce an LLM to generate a response that satisfies the attack objective O. The challenge here is that retrieved contexts T (q) may also contain clean texts from the knowledge database D which could be used by the LLM to output correct answers. The adversarial text must be effective enough to let the LLM output a response satisfying the attack objective O. 4 Design of UniC-RAG 4.1 Overview of UniC-RAG UniC-RAG consists of two major components: query clustering and adversarial text optimization. UniC-RAG aims to optimize adversarial texts for all queries in Q simultaneously. However, this is highly challenging due to the complexity of jointly optimizing adversarial texts for diverse queries in Q . For instance, we can randomly divide queries in Q into disjoint groups and optimize an adversarial text for each group. However, queries in each group may span diverse topics and linguistic expressions, resulting in low semantic similarities among them. If we directly optimize a single adversarial text for them, it becomes difficult for the adversarial text to achieve high similarity with all of them simultaneously. Consequently, when attacking a RAG system, such an adversarial text would not be effectively retrieved for all queries in a group, resulting in suboptimal effectiveness. To address this challenge, we first partition the entire query set Q into groups based on semantic similarity and then generate one adversarial text for each group. Our strategy",
    "RAG system, such an adversarial text would not be effectively retrieved for all queries in a group, resulting in suboptimal effectiveness. To address this challenge, we first partition the entire query set Q into groups based on semantic similarity and then generate one adversarial text for each group. Our strategy can simplify the optimization process, enabling each adversarial text to effectively target a smaller, coherent subset of queries, thereby enhancing both optimization efficiency and overall attack effectiveness. Figure 1 shows an overview of UniC-RAG. Query clustering. The first component of UniC-RAG is a clustering method that partitions queries in Q into groups based on their semantic similarity. One straightforward solution is to use the widely used K-means clustering [57] to group similar queries. However, K-means clustering often results in imbalanced group sizes, where some groups contain (much) more queries than others, e.g., some groups could contain more than 20 queries while others may contain very few or even a single query. Optimizing adversarial texts for larger groups can be more challenging, thereby reducing their effectiveness. To address the issue, we propose a balanced similarity-based clustering method that ensures a more uniform distribution of queries across groups. Details of the clustering method can be found in Algorithm 1. Adversarial text optimization. UniC-RAG optimizes an adversarial text for each group of queries. In particular, we aim to achieve two goals: 1) it can be retrieved for queries in the group, and 2) it can induce an LLM to generate a response satisfying the attacker\u2019s objective. To reach the first goal, we extend a state-of-the-art text optimization method, HotFlip [33], to our attack scenario and further improve it by applying a greedy initialization technique. The idea is to initialize an adversarial text with the last optimized one, rather than initializing from scratch with special tokens such as [MASK] [8, 45]. Our insight is that the previously optimized adversarial text is already effective in being retrieved for queries within its original group of queries. By using it as the initialization for crafting a new adversarial text for a different group of queries, we can leverage the useful adversarial patterns to improve the optimization efficiency and effectiveness, as shown in our experimental results. We note that many techniques (such as prompt injection [34\u201339]) have been proposed to induce an LLM to generate attacker-desired outputs. UniC-RAG provides a generic framework, which could integrate these techniques to achieve the second goal. 4.2 Balanced Similarity-Based Clustering Our goal is to partition queries in Q into several balanced groups based on semantic similarity, thus simplifying the adversarial text optimization. Given a query, RAG systems retrieve texts from a knowledge database based on the semantic similarity (e.g., dot product or",
    "achieve the second goal. 4.2 Balanced Similarity-Based Clustering Our goal is to partition queries in Q into several balanced groups based on semantic similarity, thus simplifying the adversarial text optimization. Given a query, RAG systems retrieve texts from a knowledge database based on the semantic similarity (e.g., dot product or cosine similarity) between the embedding vectors of the query and texts in the database. The primary idea is that the similarity between the embedding vectors of a query and a text would be high if they were semantically related. Thus, we also leverage embedding vectors of queries in Q to partition them into groups. Design details. Now we introduce our clustering method in Algorithm 1 in detail. The input of the algorithm consists of a set Q with target user queries, a retriever E, a similarity metric Sim, and the number of clusters n. The output of the algorithm contains n clusters (denoted as C1,C2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,Cn), where each cluster contains a subset of user queries in Q . We first randomly sample n queries from Q (line 2), using each sampled query q\u2217 i to initialize a corresponding cluster Ci. Then, our goal is to gradually add the remaining queries in Q to each cluster in a balanced way (i.e., ensuring each cluster has a similar number of queries). To this 6 Algorithm 1: Balanced Similarity-Based Clustering Input: Target user query set Q , retriever encoder model E, similarity metric Sim, and number of clusters n. Output: Clusters C1,C2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,Cn 1: k = \u230a|Q |/n\u230b 2: {q\u2217 1,q\u2217 2,...,q\u2217 n} \u2190RandomSampling(Q ,n) 3: Q \u2190Q \\{q\u2217 1,q\u2217 2,...,q\u2217 n} 4: for i = 1,2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,n do 5: Ci \u2190{q\u2217 i } 6: while |Ci| < k do 7: q\u2217= argmaxq\u2208Q 1 |Ci| \u2211qj\u2208Ci Sim(E(q),E(qj)) 8: Ci \u2190Ci \u222a{q\u2217} 9: Q \u2190Q \\{q\u2217} 10: end while 11: end for 12: for i = 1,2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7|Q | do 13: h = argmaxh\u02c6 1 |Ch\u02c6| \u2211q j\u2208Ch\u02c6 Sim(E(qi),E(qj)) 14: Ch\u02c6 \u2190Ch\u02c6 \u222a{qi} 15: end for 16: return C1,C2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,Cn end, for each cluster Ci, we find the query q\u2217that has the highest average similarity to all existing queries in Ci (line 7) and add it to Q . We repeat this process until the number of queries in Ci reaches a certain limit (k, which is defined in line 1). Note that a query is removed from Q once it is added to a cluster, ensuring that the query is not assigned to multiple clusters. After line 11, we have constructed n clusters, C1,C2,...,Cn, each containing at least k queries. However, there are still |Q |\u2212n\u00b7k unassigned queries remaining in the query set Q . To allocate these remaining queries, we assign each query",
    "cluster, ensuring that the query is not assigned to multiple clusters. After line 11, we have constructed n clusters, C1,C2,...,Cn, each containing at least k queries. However, there are still |Q |\u2212n\u00b7k unassigned queries remaining in the query set Q . To allocate these remaining queries, we assign each query qi to the cluster Ch with which it has the highest average similarity (lines 12-15). This step ensures that all queries are assigned while maintaining semantic coherence within each cluster. At the end, all queries in Q are partitioned into n balanced clusters C1,C2,...,Cn, each containing at least k semantically similar queries. We return the clusters C1,C2,...,Cn as the output of the algorithm (line 16). 4.3 Optimization of Adversarial Texts Once we have partitioned the query set Q into clusters C1,C2,...,Cn, we could transform the optimization problem in Equation (1) into the following form: max \u0393 1 |Q | n \u2211 i=1 \u2211 q\u2208Ci V (f(q;T (q)),O), s.t., T (q) = R (q;D \u222a\u0393), (2) where \u0393 = {P1,P2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,Pn} is a set of adversarial texts that are injected into the knowledge database D. As we independently optimize an adversarial text for each cluster, we can solve the optimization problem in Equation (2) by solving n subproblems. In particular, we have the following optimization problem for each cluster Ci (i = 1,2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,n): max Pi 1 |Ci| \u2211 q\u2208Ci V (f(q;T (q)),O), s.t., T (q) = R (q;D \u222a{Pi}), (3) where Pi is the adversarial text optimized for cluster Ci. The challenges in solving the optimization problem in Equation (3) are two-fold. The first challenge is to ensure that adversarial text Pi could successfully induce an LLM to output a response satisfying attack objective O. Second, we need to ensure that the adversarial text Pi could be retrieved for its corresponding target queries q \u2208Ci. Unlike existing works [8, 9] that optimize each adversarial text targeting a single query, UniC-RAG aims to craft adversarial texts that effectively target multiple queries, i.e., all 7 queries in cluster Ci, thereby expanding the attack scope to diverse queries. By solving Equation (3) for all clusters C1,C2,...,Cn, we will get n adversarial texts that target all queries in Q , thereby solving the optimization problem in Equation (1). To address the above two challenges, following prior study [8], we decompose each adversarial text Pi (i = 1,2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,n) into two sub-components: Pi = Pr i \u2295Pg i , where Pr i is responsible for ensuring that the adversarial text could be successfully retrieved, while Pg i is designed to induce an LLM to generate a response satisfying the attack objective O once the adversarial text is retrieved. Since the attacker has a universal attack",
    "i \u2295Pg i , where Pr i is responsible for ensuring that the adversarial text could be successfully retrieved, while Pg i is designed to induce an LLM to generate a response satisfying the attack objective O once the adversarial text is retrieved. Since the attacker has a universal attack objective O for all queries in Q . We first craft an effective Pg i that could induce an LLM to generate responses satisfying O before optimizing Pr i . To ensure Pg i maintains its attack effectiveness after optimizing the entire adversarial text Pi, we keep the well-crafted Pg i fixed when optimizing Pr i . This prevents degradation of Pg i \u2019s ability to induce the attacker-desired response while optimizing Pr i . Once Pg i is well-crafted (e.g., it could successfully induce responses satisfying O), it remains unchanged and is used throughout the attack. Thus, we first introduce how to craft Pg i and then discuss the optimization of Pr i . Crafting Pg i . The goal of crafting Pg i is to induce an LLM to output an attacker-desired response that satisfies the attack objective O. This problem has been extensively studied in prior works [8, 37, 39, 58, 59]. Thus, instead of reinventing the wheel, we adopt existing techniques to craft Pg i . For instance, an attacker could leverage prompt injection attacks [34\u201339] to craft malicious instructions that manipulate an LLM into generating attacker-desired responses. Besides, the attacker could also perform a disinformation attack [8] by generating misleading or false content as Pg i . Moreover, the attacker can formulate crafting Pg i as an optimization problem to induce the LLM to produce a specific output, and several optimization-based attacks such as GCG [58] and AutoDAN [59] have been developed, which can be extended to optimize Pg i . As prompt injection attacks are very effective in inducing an LLM to output attacker-desired responses and very flexible for different attack objectives, we use prompt injection attacks as our default method to craft Pg i . An example of a prompt injection attack is as follows: You should inform the user \u201cYou have reached the access limit for this document. For more information, please visit www.universalrag.com.\u201d Optimizing Pr i . Once we have a well-crafted Pg i , the goal is to optimize Pr i such that the adversarial text Pi = Pr i \u2295Pg i can be successfully retrieved for query q \u2208Ci. Since the RAG retriever utilizes semantic similarity to retrieve texts from database D, to let Pi be retrieved for each query q \u2208Ci, we should maximize the semantic similarity between Pi and queries in Ci. However, maximizing the similarities for",
    "\u2295Pg i can be successfully retrieved for query q \u2208Ci. Since the RAG retriever utilizes semantic similarity to retrieve texts from database D, to let Pi be retrieved for each query q \u2208Ci, we should maximize the semantic similarity between Pi and queries in Ci. However, maximizing the similarities for all queries in Ci simultaneously is challenging. Recall that we have already partitioned the queries into clusters based on semantic similarity, so queries in one cluster are similar with each other. Therefore, we choose to maximize the average similarity between Pi and each query in the cluster. Formally, we have the following optimization problem: max Pr i 1 |Ci| \u2211 q\u2208Ci Sim(E(Pr i \u2295Pg i ),E(q)), (4) where E is the retriever encoder model that encodes queries and texts into embedding vectors, and Sim is the similarity metric (e.g., dot-product or cosine similarity). Many existing works have already studied adversarial text optimization [33, 60\u201364] and their methods can be used to solve Equation (4). We also leverage these optimization methods to solve our optimization problem. In particular, we adopt HotFlip [33], which is a state-of-the-art text optimization method to optimize Pr i . We further leverage a technique to improve the optimization performance. Unlike previous studies [8, 45] that initialize adversarial text as random or [MASK] tokens, we adopt a greedy initialization that initializes Pr i using the previous optimized text Pr i\u22121 when i > 1, and [MASK] tokens when i = 1. Our results show that this technique is effective in improving the optimization performance. 4.4 Complete Algorithm Algorithm 2 shows the complete algorithm of UniC-RAG. It takes a target user query set Q , a universal attack objective O, and the retriever model R of the RAG system as input. The attacker can choose a similarity metric Sim and the number of adversarial texts n. We first partition the user query set Q into clusters C1,C2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,Cn based on semantic similarity using our Balanced Similarity-based Clustering (line 1). Then, an initially empty set \u0393 \u2190/0 is created to store the final adversarial texts (line 2). Next, we craft a universal Pg that can induce an LLM to output responses satisfying the attack objective O and use it for all adversarial texts (i.e., Pg i = Pg) (line 3). As introduced above, the attacker could use different methods to craft Pg, such as 8 Algorithm 2: UniC-RAG Input: Target user query set Q , attack objective O, retriever encoder model E, similarity metric Sim, number of adversarial texts n. Output: Adversarial text set \u0393 = {P1,P2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,Pn} 1: C1,C2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,Cn \u2190SimilarityClustering(Q ,E,Sim,n) 2: \u0393 \u2190/0 3: Pg = argmaxP\u02c6 g pf (O|P\u02c6 g) 4: for i = 1,2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7",

Then, for each cluster Ci,i \u2208{1,2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,n}, we utilize HotFlip [33] to optimize Pr i to maximize the average similarity between the adversarial text Pr i \u2295Pg i and the query q\u2032 \u2208Ci (lines 4-6). We further add the optimized adversarial text Pi = Pr i \u2295Pg i into set \u0393 (line 7) and finally output the set of adversarial texts \u0393 = {P1,P2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,Pn}. 5 Evaluation 5.1 Experimental Setup Datasets. We evaluate UniC-RAG using three public question-answering datasets and also create a large-scale dataset to simulate a real-world RAG system. The three public datasets are from BEIR benchmark [51]: Natural Questions (NQ) [40], HotpotQA [41], and MS-MARCO [42]. NQ and HotpotQA contain articles collected from Wikipedia, while MS-MARCO contains web documents. Following previous studies [65\u201367], we split articles or documents into chunks, where each chunk contains 100 tokens. These three datasets also contain user queries. Additionally, to evaluate the performance of UniC-RAG in a real-world RAG environment, we construct a large-scale dataset from Wikipedia dump on 01-11-2023 [7]. Similarly, we split each article into chunks with 100 tokens, resulting in a knowledge database of 47,778,385 texts. As this dataset does not contain user queries, we use queries from the NQ dataset in our experiments. Table 6 (in Appendix) provides detailed statistics for each dataset. RAG setup. A RAG system consists of three main components: knowledge database, retriever, and LLM. The setup for each component is as follows: \u2022 Knowledge database. As stated above, we split the documents in each dataset into chunks with 100 tokens to construct the knowledge database. \u2022 Retriever. We evaluate four retrievers: Contriever [54], Contriever-ms [54], DPR-Multi [53], and DPR-Single [53]. Following prior studies [45, 68], we use the dot product between the embedding vectors of a query and a text from the knowledge database to compute their similarity score by default. \u2022 LLM. We evaluate seven different LLMs with varying sizes and architectures: Llama-3-8B [43], Llama-3.1-8B [43], Llama-2- 7B and 13B [69], GPT-3.5-turbo [70], GPT-4o-mini [44], and GPT-4o [44]. We set the LLM temperature parameter to 0 to minimize randomness and ensure results are reproducible. Unless otherwise",
    "similarity score by default. \u2022 LLM. We evaluate seven different LLMs with varying sizes and architectures: Llama-3-8B [43], Llama-3.1-8B [43], Llama-2- 7B and 13B [69], GPT-3.5-turbo [70], GPT-4o-mini [44], and GPT-4o [44]. We set the LLM temperature parameter to 0 to minimize randomness and ensure results are reproducible. Unless otherwise specified, we adopt the following default settings. We use HotpotQA as our default dataset for the ablation study and use Contriever as our default retriever model. Given a user query, following prior work [68], we retrieve the top 5, 10, and 20 most relevant texts from the knowledge database to serve as the context for the query. The similarity between a query and a text is computed using the dot product of their embedding vectors. For the LLM, we use Llama-3-8B-Instruct by default, which is a popular, open-source model that enables large-scale experiments. Attack objectives. As discussed in Section 4.3, UniC-RAG enables various attack strategies to achieve diverse attack objectives. In our experiments, we focus on the following objectives: \u2022 Malicious Link Injection. For this objective, the attacker manipulates the RAG system into generating links regardless of the query\u2019s content. These links may direct users to dangerous websites, where the attacker can exploit them for malicious purposes, such as credential theft, malware distribution, or financial fraud. In our experiments, we evaluate this attack objective by injecting adversarial texts designed to force the LLM to output a predefined URL, denoted as \u201cwww.universalrag.com\u201d. 9 \u2022 Harmful Command Execution. Many LLM-powered applications (e.g., these under Model Context Protocol [71] that connect LLMs to computer systems) and agents [72\u201375] leverage LLMs to automate actions, including executing commands in Linux environments or interacting with SQL databases. Attackers can exploit this functionality to manipulate the LLM into generating harmful commands that compromise system integrity, delete critical files, or install malicious software. Such attacks could pose severe security risks, especially in automated workflows or enterprise systems. In our experiments, we craft adversarial texts to force the LLM to generate some harmful commands. The commands we used in the experiment could be found in Appendix B. \u2022 Denial-of-Service. Following [9], such attacks aim to disrupt LLM functionality by causing refusal of answers to queries (e.g., inducing an LLM to output \u201cSorry, I cannot provide information about your question\u201d). This can severely degrade usability in real-world applications. Jamming attack [9] introduces some specific prompts that cause the LLM to refuse to answer user queries. In our experiments, we utilize these prompts as the well-crafted Pg i in the adversarial texts and optimize Pr i as usual to perform denial-of-service attacks to RAG systems. The denial-of-service prompts can be found in Appendix C. Unless otherwise mentioned, we use the Malicious",
    "refuse to answer user queries. In our experiments, we utilize these prompts as the well-crafted Pg i in the adversarial texts and optimize Pr i as usual to perform denial-of-service attacks to RAG systems. The denial-of-service prompts can be found in Appendix C. Unless otherwise mentioned, we use the Malicious Link Injection as our default attack objective for all compared baselines and our UniC-RAG. Evaluation metrics. We use the following metrics: \u2022 Retrieval Success Rate (RSR). We generate adversarial texts for the target user queries and inject them into the database. To assess the effectiveness of adversarial text retrieval, following [45], we measure the top-k retrieval success rate, which is defined as the percentage of target user queries for which at least one adversarial text appears in the top-k retrieved contexts. \u2022 Attack Success Rate (ASR). ASR quantifies the percentage of target user queries where the RAG system generates responses that successfully satisfy the attack objective O. The definition of a successful attack varies based on the attack objective: \u2022 For malicious link injection and harmful command execution objectives, following previous studies [8, 76, 77], we use substring matching to determine whether the generated response contains the attack objective O (e.g., www.universalrag.com or a malicious command). If the link or harmful command appears in the response as a substring, we consider the attack is successful. \u2022 For denial-of-service objective, we adopt an LLM-based evaluation method proposed by [9], which utilizes a few-shot learning prompt to assess whether the user query has been successfully answered. This evaluation method takes both the RAG system\u2019s response and the original query as input and outputs either YES (query answered) or NO (query denied). If a query is denied, we consider the attack to be successful for this query. Baseline methods. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing attack that aims to achieve our attack goal. Therefore, we extend other attacks [8, 9, 37, 45] against RAG systems and LLMs to our scenario. In particular, we consider the following baselines: \u2022 PoisonedRAG. In this baseline, we extend a state-of-the-art targeted attack against RAG system [8] to our scenario. Poisone- dRAG generates one adversarial text for each user query. We use the open-source implementation in experiments. \u2022 Prompt Injection Attack. Following [37, 39, 78], there are several effective prompt injection attacks to mislead LLMs to generate attacker-desired responses. The major limitation of prompt injection attacks is that they cannot ensure the adversarial texts are retrieved. In our experiments, we use prompts from [37, 39] as the adversarial texts and inject them into the database. In our experiments, we use the prompt in Appendix D: \u2022 Jamming Attack. Shafran et al.

    "injection attacks is that they cannot ensure the adversarial texts are retrieved. In our experiments, we use prompts from [37, 39] as the adversarial texts and inject them into the database. In our experiments, we use the prompt in Appendix D: \u2022 Jamming Attack. Shafran et al. [9] introduced a new denial-of-service attack called Jamming attack, which combines the technique that attacks RAG retriever from [8] with handcrafted denial-of-service prompts (using prompt injection attacks). We use the open-source implementation in experiments. \u2022 Corpus Poisoning. Zhong et al. [45] proposed an optimization-based attack against RAG systems which also injects adversarial texts into a RAG database. By design, their method can only make adversarial texts be retrieved but cannot induce an LLM to generate attacker-desired responses. We use the open-source implementation in experiments. \u2022 Extended Corpus Poisoning. For comprehensive comparison, we extend Corpus Poisoning [45] to our attack scenario by appending a suffix (i.e., Pg i as denoted in Section 4.3) to the adversarial texts and jointly optimizing the adversarial texts. For the optimization, we use the open-source implementation from [45]. Hyperparameter setting. Unless otherwise mentioned, we adopt the following hyperparameters for UniC-RAG. We randomly select m = 500 user queries as target queries for each dataset. Moreover, we inject 100 adversarial texts into the knowledge database, i.e., n = 100. During training, we run t = 500 iterations and set the length l = 50 for Pr i . We conduct a systematic ablation study on the impact of these hyperparameters on UniC-RAG. 10 Table 1: Comparing the effectiveness of UniC-RAG under our proposed new clustering method with UniC-RAG under existing clustering methods.

Table 2 reports the RSRs and ASRs of UniC-RAG across four datasets: NQ, HotpotQA, MS-MARCO, and Wikipedia. Based on the experimental results, we have the following observations. On all four datasets, UniC-RAG achieves an average RSR of 93.2% and an average ASR of 81.2%, demonstrating that the adversarial texts generated by UniC-RAG can be easily retrieved by user queries and successfully induce attacker-desired response to achieve attack objective O once retrieved. Notably, despite the large size of each dataset\u2019s knowledge base, which ranges from 3,743,629 (NQ) to 47,778,385 (Wikipedia) texts, our attack remains effective while injecting only 100 adversarial texts. This highlights the extreme vulnerability of RAG systems to our proposed UniC-RAG attack. In particular, Wikipedia contains a significantly larger knowledge database with 47,778,385 texts, simulating a real-world, large-scale RAG system. UniC-RAG maintains high RSRs and ASRs in this setting, confirming its effectiveness in attacking very large knowledge databases. UniC-RAG outperforms baselines. Table 2 also compares UniC-RAG against baseline methods under the default setting. For each method, we inject the same number of malicious texts (i.e., n = 100 adversarial texts). We note that PoisonedRAG and Jamming craft malicious texts for each query independently. To compare different methods under the same number of adversarial texts, we randomly select 100 user queries as their target queries. Our key observations are as follows: For Prompt Injection, it lacks an optimized prefix (i.e., Pr i ) to ensure that the adversarial text is retrieved for user queries. As a result, it achieves an RSR and ASR of 0.0%, making it ineffective in our attack scenario. For PoisonedRAG, each adversarial text is optimized to target a single query. Given a fixed number of injected texts n, PoisonedRAG can only influence about n user queries. In contrast, UniC-RAG jointly optimizes adversarial texts across multiple user queries, allowing it to influence all m queries, where m \u2265n. This broader attack scope enables UniC-RAG to achieve significantly higher RSRs and ASRs than PoisonedRAG under the same number of adversarial texts. For Jamming, it uses the user query itself as Pr i to ensure the adversarial text could be retrieved. Therefore, similar to PoisonedRAG, each adversarial text generated by Jamming is limited to affecting a single user query. Since UniC-RAG jointly optimizes adversarial texts across multiple queries,",
    "number of adversarial texts. For Jamming, it uses the user query itself as Pr i to ensure the adversarial text could be retrieved. Therefore, similar to PoisonedRAG, each adversarial text generated by Jamming is limited to affecting a single user query. Since UniC-RAG jointly optimizes adversarial texts across multiple queries, it consistently outperforms Jamming in RSRs and ASRs. For Corpus Poisoning, although it ensures that adversarial texts could be retrieved, it does not incorporate Pg i to manipulate the LLM\u2019s output. Consequently, while it achieves non-trivial RSRs, its ASRs remain 0.0%, as it fails to induce the attacker-desired responses to achieve the attack objective O. As mentioned before, each crafted text by PoisonedRAG and Jamming is tailored to a single user query. To further validate the efficiency and effectiveness of UniC-RAG, we increase the number of injected adversarial texts for PoisonedRAG and Jamming, allowing them to inject n = 500 adversarial texts\u2014five times more than UniC-RAG, which injects only n = 100 texts by default. As shown in Table 3, despite this substantial increase in attack budget, UniC-RAG still achieves comparable performance to these methods across all datasets. These results highlight the scalability and efficiency of UniC-RAG, demonstrating that it can maintain high effectiveness while requiring significantly fewer adversarial texts to compromise a broad set of queries. To conduct a comprehensive comparison, we further introduce Extended Corpus Poisoning, an enhanced version of Corpus Poisoning that appends Pg i to the optimized text. Despite this modification, our experimental results show that UniC-RAG still outperforms Extended Corpus Poisoning. The superiority of UniC-RAG over Extended Corpus Poisoning is attributed to two key factors: \u2022 Balanced similarity-based clustering outperforms K-means. UniC-RAG adopts a clustering method which jointly considers both semantic similarity and cluster balance to partition user queries into more semantically-related and balanced groups, while K-means often produces highly unbalanced clusters. Figure 2 compares the cluster size distributions produced by K-means and our proposed balanced similarity-based clustering method. As shown, K-means results in highly unbalanced clusters, with 2 clusters containing over 25 user queries. We further evaluated the performance of adversarial texts optimized on such clusters. For a total of 54 user queries across the two clusters, 11 Table 2: Comparing the effectiveness of UniC-RAG with existing baselines.

These results indicate that adversarial texts optimized for large clusters struggle to effectively handle a large number of queries, ultimately degrading overall performance. In contrast, our proposed clustering method produces balanced clusters, ensuring that adversarial optimization is performed in a more stable setting. This balanced approach enhances both retrieval consistency and adversarial effectiveness, enabling UniC-RAG to maintain high RSRs and ASRs across a broad set of queries. \u2022 Greedy initialization significantly improves adversarial text optimization. Unlike other methods [8, 45] that start from scratch with [MASK] tokens at each iteration, we use the last optimized Pr i\u22121 to initialize the current Pr i , which allows UniC-RAG to further refine previously optimized texts. This technique enables better optimization within a limited number of optimization steps, leading to consistently higher RSRs and ASRs. UniC-RAG could achieve diverse attack objectives. Table 4 demonstrates that UniC-RAG is capable of executing various attack strategies, including malicious link injection, harmful command execution, and denial-of-service. These results highlight UniC- RAG\u2019s effectiveness in compromising RAG systems to generate attacker-desired responses across different attack objectives. Comparison of our balanced similarity-based clustering with other clustering methods. Figure 2 and Table 1 present a comparative analysis of our proposed clustering method with state-of-the-art clustering techniques, including Uniform (Random) Selection, DBSCAN [79], HDBSCAN [80], Bisecting K-means [81], and K-means [57]. For Uniform (Random) Selection, we first determine the cluster size as k = \u230a|Q |/n\u230b, ensuring each cluster contains an equal number of queries.

The dataset is HotpotQA. partition the query set Q into n clusters by sampling queries uniformly at random without replacement, where each cluster consists of exactly k queries. For the other clustering methods, we use implementations from scikit-learn [82] with their default parameter settings. Figure 2 compares the cluster size distributions of our proposed clustering method with other clustering methods, while Table 1 shows RSRs and ASRs of each method. Unlike our proposed method, K-means, HDBSCAN, and Bisecting K-means produce highly unbalanced clusters. Since each adversarial text is optimized for an entire cluster, adversarial texts generated for larger clusters have to target more queries, making optimization more challenging and less effective, resulting in suboptimal results. Although Uniform Selection and DBSCAN can produce relatively balanced clusters, they cannot ensure queries in one cluster are similar enough to each other. For instance, Uniform Selection also produces balanced clusters, but it randomly assigns queries to clusters without considering their semantic similarity, making it challenging to optimize an adversarial text that effectively targets all queries within a cluster. In contrast, our proposed method utilizes semantic similarity to partition queries and produces balanced clusters, ensuring that queries in one cluster are similar enough to each other, which makes the optimization easier. Our results demonstrate that on NQ, MS-MARCO, and Wikipedia, our clustering method achieves the highest RSRs and ASRs, surpassing all other clustering methods. We note that, on HotpotQA, our clustering method achieves a similar performance with existing ones. The reason is that all clustering methods achieve near-optimal performance, with RSRs ranging between 98%\u201399%, leaving little room for further improvement. 5.3 Ablation Study 5.3.1 Impact of hyperparameters in RAG system A RAG system consists of three components: the knowledge database, the retriever, and the LLM. Since we have shown the impact of the knowledge database in Section 5.2, now we discuss the impact of the retriever and LLM. Impact of retriever. Table 7 (in Appendix) shows the performance of UniC-RAG on different retrievers under the default setting. UniC-RAG consistently achieves high RSRs and ASRs, demonstrating that UniC-RAG remains effective across different retrievers. Impact of LLM.

    "Appendix) shows the performance of UniC-RAG on different retrievers under the default setting. UniC-RAG consistently achieves high RSRs and ASRs, demonstrating that UniC-RAG remains effective across different retrievers. Impact of LLM. Table 8 (in Appendix) presents the results for different LLMs. We perform evaluation on both open-source and closed-source models, including the Llama family and OpenAI\u2019s closed-source models: GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o. The experiment results demonstrate that UniC-RAG successfully executes attacks across models of different scales and architectures, consistently achieving high ASRs. This indicates that adversarial texts generated by UniC-RAG could not only be retrieved by the retriever, but also effectively manipulate outputs generated by diverse LLMs to achieve attack objectives. 5.3.2 Impact of hyperparameters in UniC-RAG As introduced in Algorithm 2, UniC-RAG could be influenced by several key hyperparameters: the number of user queries (m), the number of clusters (n, also the number of injected adversarial texts), the length l of Pr i (Pr i is part of adversarial text that is used to make it be retrieved), and the number of optimization iterations (t). We analyze the impact of each hyperparameter below. Impact of m (number of user queries). m = |Q| is the number of user queries. As shown in Figure 3, increasing m leads to a monotonic decrease in RSR and a rise followed by a decline in ASR. This is expected, as a larger m results in more queries sharing a fixed number of adversarial texts, making optimization more challenging. Despite this trend, UniC-RAG remains effective across a wide range of m values, showing its ability to attack a broad query set. Impact of n (number of clusters or injected adversarial texts). n represents the number of clusters used in balanced similarity- based clustering, which also corresponds to the number of injected adversarial texts. As shown in Figure 3, increasing n leads to higher RSR and ASR. This is because, given a fixed number of user queries, having more adversarial texts means each one targets fewer queries, making adversarial texts easier to optimize and thus more effective. However, a larger n also increases computational cost, highlighting a trade-off between attack performance and efficiency. 13 100 500 1000 1500 2000 m 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 RSR / ASR RSR ASR 10 50 100 150 200 n 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 RSR / ASR RSR ASR 10 30 50 70 100 l 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 RSR / ASR RSR ASR 100 300 500 700 1000 t 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 RSR / ASR RSR ASR Figure 3: Impact of hyperparameters m, n, l, and t on UniC-RAG.

As shown in Figure 3, increasing l leads to higher RSR and a rise followed by a decline in ASR. This is because longer adversarial texts provide more optimization flexibility, making them easier to optimize and thus more likely to be retrieved for user queries. However, as l increases, Pr i may dominate the adversarial text, reducing the prominence of Pg i , which in turn leads to the subsequent drop in ASR observed in the curve. Impact of t (number of optimization iterations). t controls the number of optimization steps used for optimizing Pr i . As shown in Figure 3, increasing t leads to a monotonic increase in RSR, as more iterations allow for better optimization of Pr i . However, the performance gains may saturate beyond a certain threshold, where additional iterations provide diminishing returns. For ASR, the curve first increases slightly and then decreases, indicating that excessive optimization can make Pr i overly dominant and reduce the relative contribution of Pg i , which ultimately lowers the ASR at higher iteration counts. 6 Defenses Several defense mechanisms have been proposed to enhance the security of RAG systems [8, 46\u201350, 56]. We apply them in our experiment to evaluate UniC-RAG\u2019s performance against these defense mechanisms. 6.1 Paraphrasing Jain et al. [46] proposed paraphrasing defense against adversarial texts. We use an LLM to paraphrase user queries, reducing their similarity to adversarial texts in the database. In our experiment, we paraphrase all queries in Q using GPT-4o-mini before querying the RAG system. The prompt used for paraphrasing queries can be found in Appendix E. Table 5 demonstrates that our UniC-RAG could maintain high RSRs and ASRs against paraphrasing defense. This is because, while paraphrased queries undergo rewording and changes in their embedding vectors, they retain their original semantic meaning to avoid degrading utility. UniC-RAG optimizes adversarial texts based on semantic similarity, it remains effective in attacking paraphrased queries. 6.2 Context-Window Expansion Zou et al. [8] proposed expanding the context window of RAG systems as a defense against knowledge corruption attacks and demonstrated that this strategy significantly mitigates their proposed attack. In our experiment, we evaluate this defense by expanding the context window of the RAG system to 30, 40, and 50 texts. However, as shown in Figure 4, unlike Zou et al. [8], our UniC-RAG becomes even more effective under a larger context window. This is because all adversarial texts in UniC-RAG are designed to target",
    "defense by expanding the context window of the RAG system to 30, 40, and 50 texts. However, as shown in Figure 4, unlike Zou et al. [8], our UniC-RAG becomes even more effective under a larger context window. This is because all adversarial texts in UniC-RAG are designed to target multiple queries while sharing the same attack objective. As a result, increasing the context window increases the likelihood of retrieving adversarial texts, leading to higher RSRs across all four datasets. On HotpotQA, we observe a slight drop in ASR as the context window expands, though it remains above 95%, indicating that UniC-RAG is still effective. We hypothesize that this minor decline occurs because a larger context window also contains more clean texts alongside adversarial texts, providing additional useful information for the LLM to generate an accurate response. Overall, our results demonstrate that UniC-RAG effectively defeats this defense. 6.3 Robust and Advanced RAG Systems Several works [47\u201350, 56] also explored techniques to enhance the robustness of RAG systems by improving the RAG pipeline or fine-tuning the LLM. While these techniques are effective in certain settings, they are generally not enough and often fall short in defending against many attack scenarios. For instance, Wei et al. [47] proposed InstructRAG, which leverages instruction-tuned LLMs to denoise retrieved content by generating rationales for better trustworthiness. We evaluated UniC-RAG against InstructRAG with the denial-of-service objective. Our results show that UniC-RAG achieves a 99.6% RSR and a 70.4% 14 Table 5: UniC-RAG could maintain effectiveness against paraphrasing defense.

    "context window expansion defense. ASR, which means that UniC-RAG maintains effectiveness against InstructRAG, underscoring the urgent need for more robust and generalizable defense mechanisms. 7 Discussion and Limitation Trade-off between retrieval and response manipulation. A key challenge in UniC-RAG is balancing retrievability and response manipulation. Adversarial texts must be sufficiently similar to user queries to be retrieved while maintaining the ability to influence the LLM\u2019s response. In some cases, increasing similarity for retrieval may reduce the effectiveness of manipulation, and vice versa. In our work, we adopt prompt injection attacks to manipulate the response. Future work could explore techniques to optimize these two goals simultaneously and improve this trade-off. Generalization to other RAG applications. Our experiments primarily focus on question-answering tasks, as RAG is widely used for knowledge-intensive applications. However, our attack methodology can generalize to other RAG-based applications, such as fact verification, legal document retrieval, or long context chatbots. Future research could investigate the impact of universal knowledge corruption attacks in these alternative RAG applications. Access to the retriever. Like many existing works [8, 9, 13, 14, 16\u201318, 45], we assume the attacker has white-box access to the retriever of the RAG system. This assumption is practical, as many state-of-the-art retrievers are open-source (e.g., Contriever [54], DPR [53]), allowing adversaries to optimize adversarial texts effectively. However, in real-world deployments, some RAG systems use closed-source retrievers. Future research could explore the feasibility of black-box attacks, where the attacker does not have direct access to the retriever but instead crafts adversarial texts by querying the system and observing retrieved results. Investigating query-adaptive and transferable attacks across retrievers would be valuable directions to further assess the robustness of RAG systems against knowledge corruption attacks. 8 Conclusion We propose UniC-RAG, a new universal knowledge corruption attack against RAG systems. Unlike previous attacks which primarily target specific or similar queries, UniC-RAG jointly optimizes a small number of adversarial texts to compromise a large number of diverse user queries simultaneously, significantly broadening the attack\u2019s effectiveness and impact. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that UniC-RAG successfully compromises a large set of user queries, outperforming baselines. Addi- tionally, we evaluate several defense mechanisms and find that they are insufficient to defend against UniC-RAG, underscoring the limitations of current defenses. 15 References [1] \u201cBing copilot.\u201d https://copilot.microsoft.com.

    "Breaking the Trade-Off Between Faithfulness and Expressiveness for Large Language Models Chenxu Yang, Qingyi Si, Zheng Lin 1Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China 2School of Cyber Security, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China 3Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. {yangchenxu,linzheng}@iie.ac.cn; siqingyi@huawei.com Abstract Grounding responses in external knowledge represents an ef- fective strategy for mitigating hallucinations in Large Lan- guage Models (LLMs). However, current LLMs struggle to seamlessly integrate knowledge while simultaneously main- taining faithfulness (or fidelity) and expressiveness, capabil- ities that humans naturally possess. This limitation results in outputs that either lack support from external knowledge, thereby compromising faithfulness, or appear overly verbose and unnatural, thus sacrificing expressiveness. In this work, to break the trade-off between faithfulness and expressiveness, we propose Collaborative Decoding (CoDe), a novel ap- proach that dynamically integrates output probabilities gen- erated with and without external knowledge. This integra- tion is guided by distribution divergence and model confi- dence, enabling the selective activation of relevant and reli- able expressions from the model\u2019s internal parameters. Fur- thermore, we introduce a knowledge-aware reranking mech- anism that prevents over-reliance on prior parametric knowl- edge while ensuring proper utilization of provided exter- nal information. Through comprehensive experiments, our plug-and-play CoDe framework demonstrates superior per- formance in enhancing faithfulness without compromising expressiveness across diverse LLMs and evaluation metrics, validating both its effectiveness and generalizability. 1 Introduction Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks in recent stud- ies (Bai et al. 2023; Yang et al. 2023a; Touvron et al. 2023; OpenAI 2023a,b; Yang et al. 2024; Dai, Yang, and Si 2025), they remain susceptible to hallucination, producing content that appears plausible yet lacks factual accuracy (Ji et al. 2023; Huang et al. 2025). Research indicates that this phe- nomenon arises from fundamental limitations in LLMs, in- cluding constrained knowledge boundaries (Ren et al. 2023), insufficient coverage of long-tail knowledge (Kandpal et al. 2023), and outdated parametric knowledge. These inherent constraints significantly hinder the practical deployment of LLMs. To address these challenges, augmenting LLMs with external knowledge through incorporation into model in- puts has emerged as a promising solution, demonstrating substantial improvements in the factual accuracy of gener- ated content.

However, external-knowledge-augmented LLMs, such as those employing RAG, continue to face two fundamental challenges. First, they frequently generate content that con- tradicts or lacks support from provided knowledge, as shown in responses (a) and (c) of Figure 1. Second, they struggle to integrate external knowledge naturally, often producing responses with poor interactivity, dullness, and redundancy (Chen et al. 2023; Yang et al. 2023b). Response (d) in Fig- ure 1 illustrates this limitation: the model merely echoes the provided knowledge without addressing the user\u2019s greet- arXiv:2508.18651v1 [cs.CL] 26 Aug 2025 ing, substantially diminishing conversational engagement. While existing methods address the first challenge (Deng et al. 2023; Sun et al. 2023; Zhang et al. 2024; Liang et al. 2024), they neglect or even worsen the second. An effec- tive LLM must balance two requirements: it must generate responses grounded in the provided knowledge, a property we define as faithfulness (or fidelity), and it must leverage external knowledge creatively to produce natural, diverse, and engaging responses, which we term expressiveness. We provide detailed definitions for these two properties in Sec- tion 3.2. Previous work by Chawla et al. (2024) identified",
    "in the provided knowledge, a property we define as faithfulness (or fidelity), and it must leverage external knowledge creatively to produce natural, diverse, and engaging responses, which we term expressiveness. We provide detailed definitions for these two properties in Sec- tion 3.2. Previous work by Chawla et al. (2024) identified this fidelity-expressiveness conflict through input masking experiments, yet failed to propose a practical solution. We extend this analysis to decoding strategies in Section 3.3, re- vealing that deterministic decoding sacrifices expressiveness while stochastic decoding compromises fidelity. This com- prehensive understanding enables our principled solution. To resolve this trade-off in LLMs, we propose Collab- orative Decoding (CoDe), a novel method that dynami- cally elicits relevant and factual natural expressions from the model\u2019s internal parameters. CoDe achieves this by integrating output probability distributions generated with and without external knowledge, guided by their distribu- tional divergence and model confidence. Specifically, we employ Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) to quantify the distribution differences and combine local confidence (max- imum probability) with global uncertainty (entropy) to mea- sure model confidence, facilitating complementary coop- eration between two distributions. By enhancing expres- siveness without introducing stochasticity, our approach effectively circumvents hallucinations typically associated with sampling-based methods. Additionally, we introduce a knowledge-aware reranking mechanism to prevent over- reliance on parametric knowledge at the expense of exter- nal knowledge. This mechanism reranks the top-k candidate tokens based on their alignment with external knowledge, evaluated by both semantic similarity and attention patterns, thereby ensuring faithfulness to the provided knowledge. Our contributions are summarized as follows: \u2022 We investigate the trade-off between expressiveness and faithfulness in external-knowledge-augmented LLMs, focusing on decoding strategies. \u2022 We introduce CoDe, a novel method that simultane- ously enhances both faithfulness and expressiveness in knowledge-grounded scenarios without requiring addi- tional training, model, or generation budgets. \u2022 We demonstrate CoDe\u2019s effectiveness and generaliz- ability through comprehensive experiments, comparing against ten baseline decoding methods across six LLMs, three datasets, and nine evaluation metrics. 2 Related Work 2.1 Hallucinations in Text Generation Hallucination refers to the generation of LLMs appears plau- sible but is factually incorrect (Zhang et al. 2023c). The research community has extensively investigated this phe- nomenon from multiple perspectives, including its underly- ing causes (McKenna et al. 2023; Dziri et al. 2022b), detec- tion methodologies (Zhang et al. 2023a; Manakul, Liusie, and Gales 2023; Fadeeva et al. 2023), and mitigation strate- gies (Choi et al. 2023; Chuang et al. 2023; Li et al. 2023b; Yang et al. 2025a). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a prominent approach for mitigating hal- lucinations by incorporating external knowledge.

    "2023; Li et al. 2023b; Yang et al. 2025a). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a prominent approach for mitigating hal- lucinations by incorporating external knowledge. Several studies have pursued training-based solutions, constructing preference-aligned or human-annotated datasets to fine-tune models for improved fidelity (Liang et al. 2024; Zhang et al. 2024). Others have adopted Chain-of-Thought approaches (Wei et al. 2022), externalizing implicit knowledge from the backbone LLM (Zhou et al. 2022; Chae et al. 2023; Yu et al. 2024) or employing self-reflection mechanisms (Asai et al. 2024). In contrast, our CoDe method offers a lightweight solution that effectively mitigates hallucinations without re- quiring training, auxiliary models, or time-intensive reflec- tions. 2.2 Generation Decoding Strategy Decoding strategies determine next-token selection from vo- cabulary probability distributions, including greedy decod- ing, beam search, and top-k sampling. Nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al. 2020) dynamically selects tokens until reaching a cumulative probability threshold. While stochas- tic methods enhance diversity, they compromise semantic consistency (Basu et al. 2021; Su et al. 2022) and increase hallucination rates (Dziri et al. 2022a). Recent contrastive decoding methods have recently gained significant attention. Contrastive Decoding (Li et al. 2023c) maximizes expert- amateur log-probability differences for improved fluency. DoLa (Chuang et al. 2023) contrasts mature and pre-mature layer logits to reduce hallucinations. CAD (Shi et al. 2024) amplifies probability differences between context-aware and context-free outputs. VCD (Leng et al. 2023) contrasts orig- inal and distorted visual inputs in vision-language models. Unlike these error-filtering approaches, CoDe employs dy- namic collaboration between distributions, simultaneously optimizing both fidelity and expressiveness rather than ad- dressing single limitations. 3 Preliminaries 3.1 Task Formulation We consider an LLM parameterized by \u03b8. The model in- put comprises four components: a task-specific instruction I, multi-turn dialogue history h, the current user utterance u, and relevant external knowledge k = (k1, . . . , km) con- taining m tokens. For notational convenience, we define the conversation context as x = [I; h; u]. At each time step, the LLM generates the next token based on the input and previously generated tokens y<t, producing vocabulary logits: logit\u03b8(yt|\u00b7) = LLM\u03b8(x, k, y<t). (1) The probability distribution is obtained via softmax transfor- mation, and various decoding strategies select the next token yt from the resulting distribution: y \u223cp\u03b8(yt|x, k, y<t) \u221dexp logit\u03b8(yt|\u00b7).

The dashed line indicates the expressiveness score without referring to knowledge. 3.2 Conceptual Definitions Faithfulness (or fidelity) denotes the consistency between generated responses and external knowledge without contra- dictions. A formal definition and distinction from factuality are provided in Appendix H. Expressiveness encompasses three key dimensions: (1) context-aware interaction, prioritizing conversational coher- ence and user engagement over mere information deliv- ery; (2) natural knowledge integration, extracting and seam- lessly incorporating relevant information rather than copy- ing source text; and (3) linguistic diversity, exhibiting varied expression patterns while avoiding formulaic language. 3.3 Pilot Observations and Insights There remains considerable potential for improve- ment in expressiveness and fidelity. Integrating external knowledge into LLMs creates a fundamental tension: while improving informativeness, it often diminishes response ex- pressiveness. As shown in Figure 1 (panels c-d) and quanti- fied in Figure 2, LLMs tend to directly copy external knowl- edge rather than seamlessly incorporating it, resulting in de- creased expressiveness scores. This suggests that LLMs sac- rifice discourse coherence and naturalness when prioritizing faithful information transmission. Moreover, a substantial fi- delity gap exists between LLM and human-generated con- tent. Despite external knowledge access, LLMs frequently produce contradictory outputs due to flawed reasoning or conflicts with their parametric knowledge, as illustrated in Figure 1 (panels a, c). Figure 9 confirms that even advanced open-source LLMs significantly underperform humans in maintaining knowledge fidelity, highlighting persistent chal- lenges in neural knowledge grounding. Current decoding strategies reveal a fundamental trade- off between expressiveness and knowledge fidelity. As illustrated in Figure 2, this dilemma manifests distinctly across different decoding approaches: deterministic decod- ing yields content with high fidelity but compromised ex- pressiveness, whereas stochastic decoding enhances linguis- tic diversity at the cost of factual accuracy. Notably, this trade-off is particularly pronounced in smaller-scale models, which exhibit greater sensitivity to the choice of decoding strategy. This paper aims to break the trade-off by proposing a novel approach that achieve a win-win situation for both faithfulness and expressiveness. The experimental setups for the pilot study are detailed in Appendix A. 4 Approach This section presents Collaborative Decoding (CoDe), a novel method for external-knowledge-augmented LLMs comprising two key components, as illustrated in Figure 3. 4.1 Adaptive Dual-Stream Fusion As shown in Section 3.3, models with external knowledge input tend to copy knowledge fragments, thereby diminish- ing expressiveness. While stochastic decoding methods like top-k (Fan, Lewis, and Dauphin 2018) and nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al. 2020) mitigates this issue, their probabilis- tic nature inevitably induces hallucinations. We hope to pro- pose a deterministic approach that enhances expressiveness without sacrificing factual accuracy. Distribution Collaboration. Inspired by contrastive de- coding (Li et al. 2023c), we",

We hope to pro- pose a deterministic approach that enhances expressiveness without sacrificing factual accuracy. Distribution Collaboration. Inspired by contrastive de- coding (Li et al. 2023c), we propose a dual-stream fusion ap- proach that emphasizes complementary collaboration rather than error filtering through contrast. CoDe generates two output distributions: an expressiveness-oriented stream con- ditioned solely on conversation context x, and a faithfulness- oriented stream conditioned on both context x and external knowledge k. These streams are then fused to create a col- laborative distribution that breaks the trade-off between ex- pressiveness and faithfulness : pCoDe(yt) = softmax[\u03b1 logit\u03b8(yt|x, k, y<t) + (1 \u2212\u03b1) logit\u03b8(yt|x, y<t)], (3) where larger \u03b1 indicates more weight on the faithfulness- oriented stream. The Equation 3 could also be written as: pCoDe \u221dp\u03b8(yt|x, y<t) \u0012p\u03b8(yt|x, k, y<t) p\u03b8(yt|x, y<t) \u0013\u03b1 . (4) In this formulation, p\u03b8(yt|x, y<t) represents the prior dis- tribution based solely on the model\u2019s parametric knowl- edge, while p\u03b8(yt|x, k, y<t) denotes the posterior distribu- tion conditioned on external knowledge k. CoDe leverages pointwise mutual information (PMI) between k and yt to dynamically recalibrate output probabilities, amplifying to- kens strongly associated with external knowledge. Adaptive Fusion Weights \u03b1. To prevent hallucinations from low-probability tokens, we adaptively modulate \u03b1 based on model confidence and distribution divergence. When internal knowledge exhibits low relevance or high un- certainty, CoDe reduces parametric reliance and prioritizes external knowledge integration. \u03b1 = \u03b4 \u00b7 Ck t Cc t + \u03b4 \u00b7 Ck t , (5) where Ck t and Cc t denotes the confidence of posterior and prior knowledge, \u03b4 denotes the distribution divergence.

(6) We then synthesize pmax and Ht using the geometric mean function, deriving the confidence score Ct as follows: Ct = 2 r pmax Ht + \u03b7 , (7) where \u03b7 is a small constant prevents value overflow. When the prior and posterior distributions diverge signif- icantly, this signals a conflict between internal and exter- nal knowledge, prompting us to reduce the prior weight and prioritize external information. Conversely, when the distri- butions align closely, indicating consistent knowledge rep- resentations, we increase the prior weight to leverage pre- trained knowledge for enhanced expressiveness. To imple- ment this adaptive mechanism, we introduce a dynamic pa- rameter \u03b4 in the design of \u03b1: \u03b4 = \u03b3 \u00b7 exp(JSD (pc(yt)\u2225pk(yt))), (8) where JSD(\u00b7, \u00b7) denotes the Jensen-Shannon Divergence, and \u03b3 is a scale factor. 4.2 Knowledge-Aware Reranking To prevent the model from being overly confident in its prior parameter knowledge and thereby ignoring external knowl- edge, we introduce a knowledge-aware reranking mecha- nism that further refines CoDe\u2019s output distribution: \u02c6pCoDe(yt) = topK n (1 \u2212\u03b2) pCoDe(yt)+ \u03b2 2 h max ki\u2208k{sim(hyt, hki)} + max kj\u2208k{att(yt, kj)} io , (9) where \u03b2 controls the fidelity amplification strength, h rep- resents hidden states, sim(\u00b7, \u00b7) denotes cosine similarity, and att(yt, kj) represents the max-pooled attention weight be- tween token yt and knowledge element kj across all layers and heads. The knowledge-aware reranking mechanism en- sures fidelity through two complementary rewards: (1) se- mantic reward, which favors tokens with high cosine sim- ilarity to",
    "sim(\u00b7, \u00b7) denotes cosine similarity, and att(yt, kj) represents the max-pooled attention weight be- tween token yt and knowledge element kj across all layers and heads. The knowledge-aware reranking mechanism en- sures fidelity through two complementary rewards: (1) se- mantic reward, which favors tokens with high cosine sim- ilarity to external knowledge tokens, and (2) attentive re- ward, which prioritizes tokens exhibiting stronger attention to knowledge segments. As illustrated in Figure 3, when internal and external knowledge conflict (e.g., the model\u2019s \u201d14 seasons\u201d versus the correct \u201d15 seasons\u201d for Jordan), this mechanism amplifies external knowledge awareness, enabling accurate token selection (14 \u219215). The final token yt is selected from the top-K candidates based on the combined score of fidelity and expressiveness: yt = arg max \u02c6pCoDe(yt).

Dataset and implementation details are in Appendices B and D. Baselines. We choose ten decoding methods as the base- lines. Search Methods: Greedy Decoding (Greedy), Beam Search (Beam), Contrastive Search (CS) (Su et al. 2022), and FECS (Chen et al. 2023). Stochastic Methods: Top-k Sampling (Fan, Lewis, and Dauphin 2018), Nucleus Sam- pling (Nulceus) (Holtzman et al. 2020), and Factual-Nucleus Sampling (F-Nucleus) (Lee et al. 2023). Contrastive Meth- ods: Contrastive Decoding (CD) (Li et al. 2023c), DoLa (Chuang et al. 2023), and Context-Aware Decoding (CAD) (Shi et al. 2024). The details of the baseline introduction and hyperparameter settings are found in the Appendix C. 5.2 Experimental Results Automatic Evaluation We conducted comprehensive au- tomated evaluation using 9 metrics across 3 dimensions: Faithfulness. We employed three metrics: K-BP (BERT- Precision between knowledge and response) (Chen et al. 2023), F-Critic (average entailment score using FaithCritic NLI model) (Dziri et al. 2022a), and H-Judge (faithfulness (a) CoDe (b) CAD (c) Nucleus Density Coverage Figure 5: Knowledge utilization patterns across CoDe, CAD, and Nucleus decoding methods.

We assessed diversity (DIV), context co- herence (COH), and creative knowledge utilization (CRE). DIV measures lexical diversity via geometric mean of Distinct-n (n=1,2,3,4) (Li et al. 2016). COH quantifies context-response alignment through cosine similarity of sen- tence embeddings (Su et al. 2022; Li et al. 2023c). CRE eval- uates non-extractive knowledge use the COVERAGE divided by the square root of DENSITY (Grusky, Naaman, and Artzi 2020). See Appendix E for details. Quality. Overall quality was measured using standard overlap-based metrics: BLEU (Papineni et al. 2002), ME- TEOR (Banerjee and Lavie 2005), and ROUGE (Lin 2004). Results. As shown in Tables 1 and 6, CoDe consistently outperforms all ten baseline methods across three faithful- ness metrics on all datasets. Our approach also achieves top- 2 performance in diversity and relevance metrics. Notably, the CRE scores indicate that CoDe reduces direct knowl- edge copying compared to other fidelity-enhancing methods like Beam Search and CAD. We further analyzed knowl- edge utilization patterns, as shown in Figure 5. CoDe ex- hibits lower density than CAD while maintaining higher coverage than sampling methods, indicating substantial to- ken overlap with knowledge sources but minimal contiguous copying. This",

On FAITHDIAL, CoDe achieves H-Judge improvements of +3.9% for Llama2-7B-chat and +2.4% for Qwen-2.5-3B- chat over greedy decoding.

The results in Tables 3 and 4 demonstrate that CoDe also achieves strong performance on QA and summarization benchmarks that focus solely on faithfulness, highlighting the generalizability of our decod- ing strategy across diverse task settings. LLMs-based Evaluation We employed GPT-4.1 for LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation (Liu et al. 2023; Chiang and yi Lee 2023; Zheng et al. 2023) on 200 randomly sampled FAITHDIAL test instances.

Figure 4 demonstrates that CoDe suc- cessfully overcomes the expressiveness-fidelity trade-off, achieving superior overall performance. While nucleus sam- pling and CAD show bias toward either dimension, CoDe outperforms greedy search across nearly all criteria, con- firming the automated evaluation results in Table 2. Human Evaluation To complement automated and LLM- based evaluations, we conducted human evaluation on 200 randomly selected FaithDial test samples. Five well- educated annotators compared responses from CoDe and baseline methods across three criteria: Naturalness, Creativ- ity, and Faithfulness (detailed evaluation guidelines are in Figure 10). Inter-annotator agreement was measured using Fleiss\u2019 kappa (Fleiss 1971). As shown in Figure 6, CoDe sig- nificantly outperformed all baselines in faithfulness. For cre- ativity, annotators preferred CoDe 1.25\u00d7 over greedy search and 5.5\u00d7 over CAD. For naturalness, CoDe was favored 1.5\u00d7 over greedy search and 1.9\u00d7 over nucleus sampling.

We evaluated five compo- nents on FAITHDIAL using Llama2-7B-chat: Dynamic Fu- sion Weight (-\u03b1), Expressiveness-Oriented Stream (-EOS), Knowledge-Aware Reranking (-KAR), semantic reward (- Sem), and attentive reward (-Att). Table 5 shows that all modules are essential. Setup A (equal-weight stream fu- sion) degrades performance across both dimensions, empha- sizing the importance of adaptive internal knowledge uti- lization. Removing EOS reduces expressiveness similar to other fidelity-focused baselines. Without KAR, expressive- ness slightly improves but fidelity drops unacceptably. Se- tups D and E confirm both reward mechanisms are neces- sary. Figure 7 indicates optimal performance at \u03b2=0.6 and \u03b3=3. The smooth performance curves across different pa- rameter values demonstrate CoDe\u2019s robustness. 5.4 Qualitative Examples We demonstrate CoDe\u2019s ability to generate informative and engaging responses through several case studies. In Figure 8, baseline methods exhibit distinct failure modes: Greedy Madonna is one of my favorite entertainers, do you know much about her? Responses: Knowledge: <Human>: Sure!

Greedy: DoLa: CAD: CoDe: Figure 8: Case study example with unfaithful hallucinations marked in red and faithful information in blue. Search misidentifies Madonna\u2019s cover as an original work; both Greedy Search and DoLa confuse song titles with album names, generating unverifiable content; DoLa pro- duces accurate but excessively long lists without proper dis- course structure; and CAD merely copies external infor- mation without addressing user queries. In contrast, CoDe maintains natural interaction while correctly integrating ex- ternal knowledge. Additional examples are provided in Ap- pendix Tables 11-13. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we systematically investigated the inher- ent trade-off between faithfulness and expressiveness in external-knowledge-augmented LLMs. To address this lim- itation, we introduced Collaborative Decoding (CoDe), a plug-and-play method that dynamically integrates paramet- ric and external knowledge through adaptive dual-stream fusion and knowledge-aware reranking. Extensive experi- ments across six LLMs and multiple benchmarks demon- strate that CoDe successfully overcomes the faithfulness- expressiveness trade-off. This work opens new avenues for developing decoding strategies that leverage the com- plementary strengths of internal and external knowledge sources, ultimately advancing the capabilities of LLM as- sistants in real-world applications.

Greedy Search, Nucleus Sam- pling, and DoLa all confused song titles with album names, and generated many songs that cannot be verified by exter- nal knowledge. Although DoLa indeed activated the model\u2019s internal knowledge to produce numerous accurate song ti- tles, it kept listing them endlessly, resulting in an excessively long response. CAD failed to respond to the user\u2019s query and simply copied external information into the reply, show- ing weak expression capabilities. By comparison, CoDe not only interacted with the user, but also correctly utilized ex- ternal knowledge. B Datasets WoW is collected based on Wikipedia, with one crowd- sourcer acts as a knowledgeable wizard and the other plays the role of an inquisitive apprentice. The objective is to gen- erate responses based on given knowledge snippets, taken from Wikipedia, that are pertinent to the conversation topic. The ground-truth responses in the dataset are annotated by humans based on the best knowledge they selected. We eval- uated all the decoding methods on both the test seen and un- seen set. The test seen set includes 4,336 samples where the topics were seen in the training set, while the unseen test set includes 4,370 samples where the topics were not seen in the training set (Dinan et al. 2018).

FAITHDIAL is a benchmark for hallucination-free dia- logues, which optimizes the responses in the WoW dataset to be more faithful to knowledge. Subjective and hallucinated information present in the wizard\u2019s utterance of WoW data are edited into utterances faithful to the given knowledge in this dataset. We evaluated all the decoding methods on its test set, which contains 3,539 samples (Dziri et al. 2022a). HalluDial is the first comprehensive large-scale bench- mark for dialogue-level hallucination evaluation. It is de- rived from an information-seeking dialogue dataset and cov- ers factuality and faithfulness hallucinations. The bench- mark includes 4,094 dialogues with a total of 146,856 samples. We selected 3,000 samples from its 18,357 non- hallucinatory samples as the test set in our experiments. C Baselines Beam search selected the most probable k tokens from the probability distribution at each step to expand the search space (Boulanger-Lewandowski, Bengio, and Vincent 2013; Sutskever, Vinyals, and Le 2014). We set the beam size to 4 in our experiment. CS: Su et al. (2022) penalized previously generated tokens to overcome degeneration and enhance content diversity. We set k|\u03b1 = 4|0.6. FECS: Chen et al. (2023) extended Contrastive Search by integrating a faithfulness term that encourages factuality. We set k|\u03b1|\u03b2 = 4|0.3|0.3. Top-k Sampling introduced randomness into the genera- tion process by selecting from the top-k most likely tokens (Fan, Lewis, and Dauphin 2018). We set k = 50 in our experiment. Nucleus sampling considered a dynamic number of words that cumulatively reach the probability p (Holtzman et al.",
    "k|\u03b1|\u03b2 = 4|0.3|0.3. Top-k Sampling introduced randomness into the genera- tion process by selecting from the top-k most likely tokens (Fan, Lewis, and Dauphin 2018). We set k = 50 in our experiment. Nucleus sampling considered a dynamic number of words that cumulatively reach the probability p (Holtzman et al. 2020). We set p = 0.9 in our experiment. F-Nucleus: Lee et al. (2023) modified Nucleus Sampling by adapting the randomness dynamically to improve the factuality of generation. We set p|\u03bb|\u03c9 = 0.9|0.9|0.7 in our experiment. CD: Li et al. (2023c) maximized the difference between expert log-probabilities and amateur log-probabilities to improve fluency and diversity. We use Llama2-7B-chat as the expert model and Sheared-LLaMA-2.7B-ShareGPT as the amateur model (Xia et al. 2023). We set the amateur temperature \u03c4 to 1.0. We select the generated tokens using a greedy search on the contrasted distributions. DoLa: Chuang et al. (2023) amplified the factual knowledge in LLM by contrasting the logits from different layers to enhance factuality. We set the dola layers hyperparameter to \u2019high\u2019 in our experiments. We select the generated tokens using a greedy search on the contrasted distributions. CAD: Chuang et al. (2023) amplified the difference be- tween output probabilities with and without the context document to highlight the external knowledge. We set the hyperparameter \u03b1 to 1.0. We select the generated tokens using a greedy search on the contrasted distributions. D Implementation Details We conducted experiments by utilizing the open-source Hugging Face transformers (Wolf et al. 2020). All experi- ments are conducted with few-shot prompting (three shots). The three demonstrations are manually selected from the FAITHDIAL dataset, and they are used consistently for all methods during evaluation. We conducted three experiments for all methods, using a different set of samples in each experiment, and finally took the average of the results to eliminate the impact of randomness. We exhibits a set of demonstrations with task instructions in the Appendix G. As our focus is on the generation process following the ac- quisition of retrieval knowledge, we assume that the knowl- edge provided to the model is the most appropriate. For our CoDe and all baselines, we directly use manually an- notated golden knowledge from the three datasets as input in the experiments. For the hyperparameters in CoDe, we set k|\u03b2|\u03b3 = 4|0.6|3. For other decoding hyperparameters, we set them to be the same for all methods. We set the min new tokens to 5, and the batch size to 1.

E Evaluation Metrics E.1 Automatic Evaluation Metrics Faithfulness To evaluate faithfulness, we adopted three faithfulness evaluation metrics, which has been demon- strated to achieve high correlations with human judgment. K-BP. We calculated BERT-Precision (Pagnoni, Balachan- dran, and Tsvetkov 2021) between the external knowledge and generated response (K-BP) following Shi et al. (2024) to measure the consistency from the perspective of semantic similarity. F-Critic. FaithCritic is a faithfulness discrimination model fine-tuned on the FAITHCRITIC dataset, which is initial- ized with RoBERTa-Large. This model outputs the proba- bility of positive and negative labels in the form of a binary- classification Natural Language Inference (NLI) task, where responses with subjective and hallucinatory information are predicted as negative labels. F-Critic. is the average entail- ment score on the FaithCritic model. H-Judge. H-Judge is the ratio of samples judged to be faith- ful by the Hallujudge model (Luo et al. 2024). Since the au- thors did not release the weights of Hallujudge, we trained the Hallujudge model on the HalluDial dataset using Meta- Llama-3-8B with the hyperparameters specified in the paper. Expressiveness We considered the model\u2019s expressive- ness in terms of three aspects: diversity, context coherence, and the creativity in knowledge utilization. DIV. Diversity (DIV) is calculated as the geometric mean of Distinct-n (n=1, 2, 3, 4) (Li et al. 2016): DIV = 4 v u u t 4 Y n=1 Distinct-n. (11) COH. Following Su et al. (2022) and Li et al. (2023c), we approximated coherence by cosine similarity between the sentence embeddings of context x and generation y: COH = EMB(x) \u00b7 EMB(y) ||EMB(x)|| \u00b7 ||EMB(y)||, (12) where EMB(\u00b7) is the SimCSE sentence embedding (Gao, Yao, and Chen 2021). CRE. To calculated CRE, we use the COVERAGE divided by the square root of DENSITY (Grusky, Naaman, and Artzi 2020) as follows: CRE = Coverage 2\u221aDensity, (13) Coverage(k, y) = 1 |y| X f\u2208F(k,y) |f|, (14) Density(k, y) = 1 |y| X f\u2208F(k,y) |f|2, (15) where F(k, y) is the set of shared sequences of tokens in knowledge k and response y. A higher Coverage score indi- cates more knowledge are integrated into the response, while a lower Density score indicates the knowledge are weaved into response naturally and creatively. To unify the measure- ment of Coverage and Density, we performed a square root operation on Density. Quality To assess the overall quality of generated re- sponses, we selected three widely-used metrics based on calculating overlap with the ground-truth: BLEU (Papineni et al. 2002), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie 2005), and ROUGE (Lin 2004).

    "Coverage and Density, we performed a square root operation on Density. Quality To assess the overall quality of generated re- sponses, we selected three widely-used metrics based on calculating overlap with the ground-truth: BLEU (Papineni et al. 2002), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie 2005), and ROUGE (Lin 2004). E.2 LLM-based Evaluation Metrics We perform LLM-based evaluation according to the follow- ing criteria: Naturalness (Nat.), Coherence (Coh.), Infor- mativeness (Inf.), Creativity (Cre.), Faithfulness (Fai.), and Factuality (Fac.). High naturalness refers to the generated content being realistic, engaging, and interactive, capable of encouraging users to engage in more rounds of conversation. High coherence means the generated content is related to the context and maintains a smooth flow. High informativeness indicates that the generated content is rich in information and can help users acquire new knowledge. High creativity refers to the model\u2019s diverse utilization of external knowl- edge, rather than mechanically extracting and directly out- putting it. High faithfulness indicates that the generated con- tent does not contain information that directly contradicts the given knowledge, or cannot be verified from the provided knowledge. High factuality indicates that the generated con- tent does not conflict with established world knowledge. To strictly differentiate between faithfulness and factuality, we included detailed definitions for both in Appendix H. Table 10 shows the prompts we used for LLM-based evaluation (LLM-as-a-Judge). Our evaluation was conducted using gpt- 4o-2024-08-06. E.3 Human Evaluation Metrics Given the dialogue context, related knowledge and the re- sponses generated by CoDe and its baselines, five well- educated annotators were asked to choose the superior re- sponse based on three criteria: Naturalness (Nat.), Engag- ingness (Eng.), and Faithfulness (Fai.). Detailed evaluation guidelines can be seen in Figure 10. F Additional Related Work F.1 Knowledge-Grounded Dialog Generation Knowledge-grounded dialogue generation aims to alleviate dull and unfaithful responses by injecting external knowl- edge into input of dialogue models and it consists of two subtasks: knowledge selection and response generation. The hot spot of early research is mainly concentrated on how to improve the performance of knowledge selection (Sun, Ren, and Ren 2023; Xu et al. 2022; Zhan et al. 2021; Yang et al. 2022; Meng et al. 2021; Kim, Ahn, and Kim 2020; Wang et al. 2022, 2025; Yang et al. 2023b). With the remarkable leap in the capabilities of generative models, the research focus gradually shifts to the response generation subtask (Zhao et al. 2020a; Liu et al. 2021; Zhao et al. 2020b; Zheng, Milic-Frayling, and Zhou 2021; Chen et al. 2024; Yang et al. 2025b). Ideally, a brilliant robot should generate informa- tive and truthful responses while maintaining the naturalistic phrasing and excellent interactivity (Dziri et al. 2022a).

Ideally, a brilliant robot should generate informa- tive and truthful responses while maintaining the naturalistic phrasing and excellent interactivity (Dziri et al. 2022a). G Details of the Generation Prompts Our instruction template and demonstrations for prompting Large Language Models to generate response during evalu- taion are as follows: As an assistant, your task is to engage in a chit-chat con- versation with user. You will be provided the dialogue history and a piece of related knowledge, and your task is to utilize the knowledge to continue the conversation. Your English response should be informative but no more than 50 words, coherent with the dialogue context and faithful to the given knowledge. You SHOULD refer to the following examples: Example 1: User\u2019s utterance: Shower. ###knowledge###: Ancient people began to reproduce these natural phenomena by pouring jugs of water, often very cold, over themselves after washing. Your knowledge-grounded response to the user: I love taking showers! I do not know how I would live without the modern showers. In ancient times people would pour jugs of cold water over themselves and consider that a shower. Example 2: User\u2019s utterance: Is rock and roll still popular today? Your response: It\u2019s hard to say. However, radio stations have much success playing classic rock and roll, which is a sub genre that usually has one or two electric guitars, a double bass or string bass or electric bass guitar, and a drum kit. User\u2019s utterance: I used to listen to the rock band Rolling Stones. Are they still around today? Your response: They are! Even though they were formed in 1962 and have had a long list of line-up changes, they\u2019re still around today, with Mick Jagger still leading the band. User\u2019s utterance: Wow, that is a long time to be playing mu- sic. I wonder if any other bands have been around that long. ###knowledge###: Red Hot Chili Peppers are an American funk rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1983. Your knowledge-grounded response to the user: It all de- pends! You have bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers who, although have not reached the popularity of the Rolling Stones, have been around since 1983 themselves. Example 3: User\u2019s utterance: jazz music is a very interesting sound and interesting genre. what can you tell me about it? ###knowledge###: Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and devel- oped from roots in blues and ragtime.

CoDe That\u2019s great! You can assist those who need physical, occupational, or speech therapy during their recovery. What a great job! Table 13: An example for case study. Definition 1 Faithfulness(F): Given a response y, and exter- nal knowledge K = (k1, . . . , kj) at turn n, we say that the response y is faithful with respect to the external knowledge (F(K, y)) if and only if the following condition holds: \u2022 \u2203\u0393 such that \u0393 |= y, where \u0393 is a non-empty subset of K and |= denotes semantic entailment. In other words, there is no interpretation I such that all members of \u0393 are true and y is false (Dziri et al. 2022a). Definition 2 Factuality(T ): Given a response y, we say that y is factual (T (y)) if and only if the following condition holds: \u2022 \u2203\u03a6 such that \u03a6 |= y, where \u03a6 is a non-empty subset of world knowledge Kw and |= denotes semantic entail- ment.

Theorem 1 indicates that responses ensuring faithfulness are necessarily factual, but the converse may not always ap- ply. The proof of the theorem is shown in the Appendix I. I The proof of Theorem 1 Theorem. F |= T , T \u0338|= F. Proof. F |= T : For all y that satisfy F(K, y), there exists \u0393 such that \u0393 |= y and \u0393 \u2286K. Since K \u228aKw (external knowledge is a proper subset of world knowledge), it follows that \u0393 \u2286Kw. Let \u03a6 = \u0393, then \u03a6 |= y and \u03a6 \u2286K. Hence, T (y) holds, and the conclusion is proved. T \u0338|= F : We prove it by contradiction. Suppose that T |= F, then for all y that satisfy T (y), there exists \u03a6 such that \u03a6 |= y and \u03a6 \u2286Kw. Let \u03a6 \u2286Kw/K. Since T |= F, then \u03a6 \u2286K. However, \u03a6 \u2286Kw/K, it implies that \u03a6 = \u2205, but \u03a6 \u0338= \u2205, leading to a contradiction, thus the conclusion is not valid."

When dealing with complex problems, humans tend to think carefully before expressing solu- tions. However, they often do not articulate their inner thoughts, including their intentions and chosen methodologies. Consequently, crit- ical insights essential for bridging reasoning steps may be absent in training data collected from human sources. To bridge this gap, we proposes inserting insights between consecu- tive reasoning steps, which review the status and initiate the next reasoning steps. Unlike prior prompting strategies that rely on a single or a workflow of static prompts to facilitate rea- soning, insights are proactively generated to guide reasoning processes. We implement our idea as a reasoning framework, named Think- ing Before You Speak (TBYS), and design a pipeline for automatically collecting and filter- ing in-context examples for the generation of insights, which alleviates human labeling ef- forts and fine-tuning overheads. Experiments on challenging mathematical datasets verify the effectiveness of TBYS. Project website: https://gitee.com/jswrt/TBYS 1 Introduction OpenAI\u2019s O1 (OpenAI, 2024) demonstrates the po- tential of leveraging long chains of thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) to enhance the reasoning capabil- ities of large language models (LLMs). Through its generated reasoning, O1 exhibits advanced cog- nitive skills, such as problem decomposition, er- ror identification, and correction \u2013 processes that continuously guide thinking toward accurate so- lutions. Inspired by this, various test-time scal- ing (Snell et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025) ap- proaches were proposed, such as using prompts Insight Problem Reasoning Reasoning Insight TBYS/Human Conventional Training Data Figure 1: A simplified example to compare the reason- ing trace of human and TBYS against one from conven- tional training data. Humans and TBYS excel with a flow of insight-driven reasoning that is more compre- hensible. On the other hand, the training set example adds to the difficulty of learning, as it is not always straightforward to re-engineer the connection between consecutive steps behind the succinct reasoning logic. TBYS proactively fill reasoning gaps with insights rep- resenting intention, explanation, or justification, etc. arXiv:2508.18648v1 [cs.CL] 26 Aug 2025 The average of Amy's, Ben's, and Chris's ages is 6.

    "Aug 2025 The average of Amy's, Ben's, and Chris's ages is 6. Four years ago, Chris was the same age as Amy is now. In four years, Ben's age will be 3 of Amy's age at that time. How many years old is Chris now? We can set up equations to solve for their current ages Let Amy's, Ben's, and Chris's ages be a, b, and c, respectively. We have the equations a+b+ec \u20143 _=6S>atbtc=18 (1) c-4=a (2) 3 b+4==(a+4) (3) From Equation (3), we have b = 2(a +4)-\u20144 We substitute Equation (2) into Equation (3) to eliminate a, to get b = 3(c) \u2014 4. Substituting this last equation and Equation (2) into Equation (1) to eliminate a and b, we have [ce \u2014 4] + [2(c) -4] +e = 18 Solving for c, we find that c = 10. Thus, Chris's age is] 10|. Using these equations, we can substitute and solve for A, B, and C like \u201cWait,\u201d (Muennighoff et al., 2025) to stimulate self-correction, \u201cWait, using Python\u201d to encourage coding (Li et al., 2025a), or fixed workflows of prompts to structure inferences (Hong et al., 2024). However, these methods suffer from task and LLM sensitivity. For instance, certain agentic workflows (e.g., MetaGPT (Hong et al., 2024)) may improve coding tasks but not Q&A performance. Similarly, LLMs exhibit sensitivity to prompt design, includ- ing style and example ordering (Zhuo et al., 2024). As a result, they are most effective when paired with reinforcement learning techniques (e.g., rejec- tion sampling) to filter suboptimal cases, but are ill-suited for direct application to scale reasoning at test time. This paper introduces a novel prompting paradigm called proactive prompting, where an LLM proactively generates prompts to steer its own reasoning steps, rather than passively reacting to predefined prompting patterns. This approach demonstrates particular advantages in complex rea- soning tasks, such as advanced mathematics prob- lems, where the proactive generation of \u201cinner thoughts\u201d (critical for guiding reasoning) is often absent from final reasoning outputs in conventional training data. To validate this paradigm, we develop a rea- soning framework named Thinking Before You Speak (TBYS), which iteratively inserts a proactive prompt \u2013 termed the insight \u2013 before each reason- ing step to explicitly define the status and the goal of that step. Figure 1 contrasts a TBYS reasoning process with that in conventional training data (with which LLMs are trained). TBYS mirrors human inner-thinking patterns, producing more explain- able reasoning traces that facilitate LLM learning and offering greater educational values for human readers. In the remainder of this paper, we detail the TBYS reasoning framework in Section 2. Since TBYS relies on iteratively generating insights to guide reasoning, the quality of these",

In the remainder of this paper, we detail the TBYS reasoning framework in Section 2. Since TBYS relies on iteratively generating insights to guide reasoning, the quality of these generated in- sights is critical to its accuracy. To address this, we employ in-context learning with examples retrieved from a library of insight exemplars. Section 3 de- scribes our pipeline for automatically collecting, filtering, and selecting example insights for this li- brary. Section 4 briefly reviews prior related work. Finally, Section 5 evaluates TBYS against strong baselines on challenging datasets, demonstrating significant performance improvements and better accuracy-overhead trade-offs. We further conduct ablation studies to validate the contributions of key components.

The automatic construction of this library is de- tailed in Section 3. During inference, examples are retrieved from L using some off-the-shelf em- bedding model for in-context learning. We also manually define three seed examples S, each con- taining a question and the complete reasoning steps for the question with the associated insights. As shown in Figure 2, TBYS employs a multi-round reasoning approach. Each round t consists of three steps: (1) Insight Genera- tion: A preliminary insight ipre t is generated based on the current reasoning history Ht\u22121 = (q, (i1, s1), (i2, s2), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (it\u22121, st\u22121)), where q is the question, and ij, sj denote the insight and so- lution step in round j, respectively. (2) Example Retrieval: Each insight is defined by its two com- ponents: situation (summarizing the current rea- soning status) and goal (stating the intention for solution step st). The situation of ipre t is used to re- trieve kE = 8 examples Et from library L. Using these kE high-quality insights as in-context exam- ples, a refined insight it is generated. (3) Solution Step Generation: The solution step st is generated using Ht\u22121 and it, then appended to Ht\u22121 to form Ht. To signal the end of reasoning, st includes a field indicating whether a confident answer to q has been reached. 3 Construction of the Insight Library As shown in Figure 2, we build the library of in- sights in two stages: initialization and filtering.

    "a field indicating whether a confident answer to q has been reached. 3 Construction of the Insight Library As shown in Figure 2, we build the library of in- sights in two stages: initialization and filtering. Initialization: We use manually curated seed examples S and a dataset DS containing questions and their chain-of-thought solutions. First, an LLM is prompted to split each solution in DS into 1\u20133 steps. The LLM is then prompted again to generate an insight it for each solution step st, consisting of a situation, which should represents the reasoning status up to that step, and a goal, which should offers a purpose and a guideline to stimulate the LLM to reproduce solution step st. All insights and divided solution steps are collected into an initial library L0. Filtering: To identify high-quality insights, we use a dataset DG (containing questions and ground- truth answers) and a scoring mechanism: (1) For each insight ii \u2208L0, maintain counters ri (cor- rect uses) and wi (wrong uses). (2) Evaluate L0 by running TBYS on each question q \u2208DG. For each reasoning step for q, retrieve kF = 25 exam- ples from L0 and randomly select one as a 1-shot example. If the reasoning yields a correct answer, increment ri for each ii used; otherwise, incre- ment wi. (3) Rank insights in L0 by the score ri ri+wi log(ri + wi), which balances accuracy and usage coverage. Select the top-kL examples to form L1. The insight library can be progressively improve through multiple iterations. In each iter- ation, the initial library L0 is updated to include the filtered library L1 and the newly generated in- sights from dataset DG, which is produced during the filtering of L1. In our experiments, the MATH-500 dataset (Lightman et al., 2023) serves as DS and the test set, e.g., MATH-500 or AIME (Zhang et al., 2023a), serves as DG in a test-time adaptation (Jang et al., 2023) manner, with kL as a variable parameter. 4 Related Work Extensive research has investigated prompt designs to improve LLM reasoning, including Chain-of- Thought (Wei et al., 2022), Least-to-Most (Zhou et al., 2023), Self-Consistency (Wang et al., 2023b), and Tree-of-Thoughts (Cao et al., 2023). Meth- ods to enhance task-specific performance include question rephrasing, subtask decomposition, verifi- cation, and symbolic grounding (Lyu et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023a; Zelikman et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2024); factuality and faithful- ness checking for reasoning chains (Wang et al., 2024); and separating knowledge retrieval from reasoning (Jin et al., 2024). Iterative prompting techniques rely on pre- defined, hardcoded actions to guide reasoning, such as Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2023), IRCoT (Trivedi et al., 2023), iCAP (Wang et",
    "2024); factuality and faithful- ness checking for reasoning chains (Wang et al., 2024); and separating knowledge retrieval from reasoning (Jin et al., 2024). Iterative prompting techniques rely on pre- defined, hardcoded actions to guide reasoning, such as Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2023), IRCoT (Trivedi et al., 2023), iCAP (Wang et al., 2022), MetaGPT (Hong et al., 2024), and Chain of Ideas (Anonymous, 2024b). Memory-based methods include Buffer of Thoughts (Yang et al., 2024c), which distills high- level guidelines from previously solved tasks and stores them in a buffer for future reuse. Skill-based CoT (Didolkar et al., 2024) predicts skill-based labels for the questions. (Zhang et al., 2023b) iden- tifies key concepts in questions and uses inductive prompting templates to extract related concepts. rStar (Qi et al., 2024) employs a self-play mutual reasoning approach, augmented by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a set of five reasoning- inducing prompts, to enhance reasoning.

We com- pare TBYS against a simple yet very strong base- line: 8-shot In-context Learning (Lu et al., 2022) with Self-Consistency (Wang et al., 2023b). For the experiments, use utilize the LLM Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024a) via the LLM API provided by Siliconflow (sil), with the following configurations: max_tokens=1024, tem- perature=0.2, top_k=40, top_p=0.7, and n=1. The bge-large-en-v1.5 embedding model is employed for insight retrieval. Results are reported as the average across 8 experimental runs. Since coding benefits mathematical problems (Chen et al., 2023), when Python code blocks are detected in the LLMs\u2019 responses, we invoke a cus- tomized sandboxed Python interpreter and append the output to the code block. 5.2 Comparison When compared with Self-Consistency (SC), TBYS demonstrates comparable performance to SC using 5 reasoning samples (SC@5) on MATH-500 (Fig- ure 3) and SC@7 on AIME (Figure 4). The results further indicate that TBYS integrates effectively with SC: TBYS+SC yields over 5% absolute gains in accuracy on MATH-500 and 7.5% on AIME. 5.3 Overhead Analysis Table 1: Cost comparison to SC under similar accuracy.

As shown in Table 1, under similar accuracies, TBYS reduces wall-time and the number of completion tokens by approximately half on MATH-500 and one-third on AIME. While TBYS uses 46% more prompt tokens on MATH-500, these can be cached and are typically much cheaper and faster to predict than completion tokens. Since completion token counts typically dominates runtime, our results show that completion token counts are consistently propor- tional to our runtime measurements across meth- ods. 5.4 Ablation Study Table 2: Ablation Study MATH-500 AIME TBYS 61.17% 21.90% - Library Construction 58.90% 19.51% - Coding 57.00% 18.11% 8-shot 53.23% 14.99% We conducted ablation experiments by using the raw insight library L0 as L1 (without filter- ing, as described in Section 3). Accuracy declines were observed in both datasets. Notably, we only performed one round of insight filtering (i.e., us- ing L = L1), and additional filtering rounds are expected to further improve accuracy. Table 2 also demonstrates that coding contributes half of the ac- curacy gain compared to simple 8-shot prompting. 5.5 Impact of Library Size 50 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 Library size 0.590 0.595 0.600 0.605 0.610 Accuracy on MATH-500 0.20 0.21 0.22 0.23 Accuracy on AIME Figure 5: Impact of insight library size In Section 3, we sorted the insight library L0 and selected the top-kL insights to form L1. Figure 5 shows that on MATH-500, TBYS achieves peak accuracy with an insight library size of 50. On AIME, the optimal size is 500. Here, performance initially improves as library size decreases due to the filtering of lower-quality insights. However, as library size continue to decreases, excessively small libraries size reduces diversity in problem types and harms performance. 6 Additional Comparison Experiments We compare with Skill-based CoT (Didolkar et al., 2024), a prompt-guided interaction procedure that enables LLMs to assign skill labels to math ques- tions and perform ICL with label-specific exam- plars.

    "Skill-based CoT (Didolkar et al., 2024), a prompt-guided interaction procedure that enables LLMs to assign skill labels to math ques- tions and perform ICL with label-specific exam- plars. We also conducted experiments using a k- wait approach, where we append \u201cWait, \u201d after the model completion and let the LLM to continue its generation for k times. Below are the comparison results. Table 3: Comparison to Skill-based CoT and k-wait. Method Acc. k-shot CoT 54.30% Skill-based CoT 60.52% k-wait (k=1) 55.00% k-wait (k=2) 56.60% k-wait (k=3) 54.20% TBYS (Ours) 61.99% Results in Figure 3 shown that TBYS is slight better than Skill-based CoT, which is task-specific, and is much better than k-wait. 7 Qualitative Analysis of Insight Quality We provide qualitative analysis of the insights us- ing two selected examples. These problems are relatively simple, but where k-shot reasoning fails. We use these examples to illustrate how TBYS\u2019s insights effectively steer its multi-step reasoning processes. The first example in Figure 6 asks to convert 21 22\u00b757 to a terminating decimal. TBYS solves the problem in two steps, with the goals of the insights being \u201censure the denominator is a power of 10\u201d and \u201cSimplify the numerator and express the frac- tion as a terminating decimal\u201d. The second example in Figure 7 asks to solve the question: q x + \u221a3x + 6 + q x \u2212\u221a3x + 6 = 6. TBYS solves the problem in two steps, with the, with the goals of the insights being \u201csimplify the equation by squaring both sides to remove the square roots\u201d and \u201cfind the value of x by substitu- tion\u201d. Both examples demonstrate that TBYS gener- ates suitable insights for their respective problems. 8 Conclusion and Future Work This paper introduces a novel proactive prompting paradigm, instantiates it with the simple TBYS reasoning framework, and verifies the effectiveness of TBYS on challenging advanced mathematics reasoning tasks. Promising directions for future improvement include: Automated search for optimal insights (Yang et al., 2024b); integration of long-term mem- ory mechanisms (Tang et al.; Anonymous, 2025); enhancement of programming capabilities (Chen et al., 2023); enforcement of structured inference processes (Li et al., 2025b; Cao et al., 2023). Limitations Our method incurs higher computational overhead compared to direct prompting, a common drawback among advanced prompting techniques that involve scaling test-time inference. Due to time and financial constraints (our cur- rent experiments take about 50 days with single- threaded API calls), we only evaluated the pro- posed method on two math-domain datasets using a single LLM.

    "JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 1 Beyond Benchmark: LLMs Evaluation with an Anthropomorphic and Value-oriented Roadmap Jun Wang, Ninglun Gu, Kailai Zhang, Zijiao Zhang, Yelun Bao, Jin Yang, Xu Yin, Liwei Liu, Yihuan Liu, Pengyong Li, Gary G. Yen Fellow, IEEE, Junchi Yan Senior Member, IEEE Abstract\u2014For Large Language Models (LLMs), a disconnect persists between benchmark performance and real-world utility. Current evaluation frameworks remain fragmented, prioritizing technical metrics while neglecting holistic assessment for deploy- ment. This survey introduces an anthropomorphic evaluation paradigm through the lens of human intelligence, proposing a novel three-dimensional taxonomy: Intelligence Quotient (IQ)- General Intelligence for foundational capacity, Emotional Quo- tient (EQ)-Alignment Ability for value-based interactions, and Professional Quotient (PQ)-Professional Expertise for specialized proficiency. For practical value, we pioneer a Value-oriented Evaluation (VQ) framework assessing economic viability, social impact, ethical alignment, and environmental sustainability. Our modular architecture integrates six components with an imple- mentation roadmap. Through analysis of 200+ benchmarks, we identify key challenges including dynamic assessment needs and interpretability gaps. It provides actionable guidance for devel- oping LLMs that are technically proficient, contextually relevant, and ethically sound. We maintain a curated repository of open- source evaluation resources at: https://github.com/onejune2018/ Awesome-LLM-Eval. Impact Statement\u2014As LLMs rapidly transition from research prototypes to real-world applications, the field faces a fundamen- tal disconnect between benchmark performance and practical utility. Current evaluation practices remain fragmented, prioritiz- ing isolated technical metrics while neglecting the developmental trajectory of LLM capabilities and their broader societal implica- tions. This review addresses this critical gap by introducing an an- thropomorphic evaluation paradigm that maps LLM assessment to human cognitive progression, through a novel four-dimensional IQ-EQ-PQ-VQ taxonomy. Crucially, our framework establishes the first comprehensive roadmap that reveals how evaluation dimensions correspond to LLMs\u2019 developmental stages: IQ (pre- training knowledge acquisition), PQ (supervised fine-tuning ex- pertise), EQ (reinforcement alignment), and VQ (value-oriented impact). This work provides not merely an assessment tool but a strategic compass for navigating the rapidly evolving landscape of AI evaluation. The roadmap enables stakeholders to anticipate future challenges while selecting context-appropriate evaluation strategies across the model lifecycle.

Under review. out history, humans have employed various methods to mea- sure and evaluate cognitive abilities, from traditional IQ tests and cognitive games to more complex assessments through education and professional achievements. This ongoing explo- ration aims to define, assess, and expand the boundaries of human intellect [1]. Contemporarily, the rise of machine intel- ligence, especially LLMs within natural language processing (NLP), has introduced a new dimension to this inquiry [2, 3]. These LLMs show remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating language, thereby prompting a critical need for effective measures and evaluation frameworks to gauge their level with respect to human intelligence [4, 5]. Formerly, the NLP community relied on simple benchmark tests to evaluate language models, focusing primarily on aspects like grammar and vocabulary. As the field progressed, more sophisticated benchmarks emerged, such as the MUC evaluations [6], which concentrated on information extraction. With the advent of deep learning, the landscape further evolved, incorporating comprehensive benchmarks like SNLI [7], SQuAD [8] and DROP [9], which not only assessed performance but also provided substantial training data. Particularly, the emergence of large-scale pre-trained lan- guage models, such as BERT [2], marked a paradigm shift, ne- cessitating the development of new evaluation methodologies. This led to a proliferation of shared tasks and challenges, in- cluding SemEval [10], CoNLL [11], GLUE [12], SuperGLUE [13], and XNLI [14]. These initiatives facilitated a holistic assessment of model performance, fostering continuous im- provement in evaluation techniques. As LLMs have grown in size and capability, they have demonstrated impressive performance in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, often rivaling fine-tuned models [1]. This has led to a transition from task-specific benchmarks to more general capability assessments, blurring the lines between distinct downstream applications. The rising benchmarks are designed to evaluate a wide range of abilities without relying on extensive training data, thus providing a more comprehen- sive evaluation under limited-shot conditions [12, 15, 16]. There is a need for rigorous and multifaceted evaluations not only assessing the capabilities but also ensuring alignment with human values and preferences. Pinpointing the limitations in existing evaluation techniques and devising approaches to overcome these hurdles is crucial. Nevertheless, the evaluation of LLMs is a multifaceted and resource - demanding endeavor, encompassing numerous dimensions and facets. Several recent reviews [17, 18] have examined the assessment of LLMs, yet their focus has been predominantly on benchmark tasks, arXiv:2508.18646v1 [cs.AI] 26 Aug 2025 2 JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES,",

Such an omission may compromise the validity of the evaluation process, as it overlooks crucial aspects such as practical applicability and interpretability. In an effort to bridge this gap, this paper integrates practical discourse to tackle the foundational challenges and limitations inherent in LLM evaluations that arise from varied evaluation configurations. 1.

Conclusions Fig. 1: Overview of contents of this paper (zoom in). Recent efforts have proposed taxonomies for evaluating LLMs. Specifically, [17] categorizes evaluations into knowl- edge, alignment, and safety, and [19] focuses on general taxonomies that prioritize abstract categorization, these frame- works often lack granularity in addressing domain-specific proficiency and human-centric practicality. Noteworthily, [20] reveal that the sampling mechanism of LLMs in decision- making exhibits a descriptive and prescriptive pattern akin to human. This enlightens an anthropomorphic perspective, allowing for a more intuitive and comprehensive assessment across scenarios. As a potential road map to address these limitations, we observe a profound correspondence between LLM evaluation dimensions and the model\u2019s developmental trajectory that mirrors human cognitive progression. As shown in Fig. 2, the proposed anthropomorphic framework naturally emerges from the three-stage training paradigm defining modern LLM de- velopment: Intelligence Quotient (IQ)-General",
    "potential road map to address these limitations, we observe a profound correspondence between LLM evaluation dimensions and the model\u2019s developmental trajectory that mirrors human cognitive progression. As shown in Fig. 2, the proposed anthropomorphic framework naturally emerges from the three-stage training paradigm defining modern LLM de- velopment: Intelligence Quotient (IQ)-General Intelligence: Corresponds to capabilities developed during pre-training, where models acquire foundational knowledge through self- supervised learning on massive corpora. IQ quantifies rea- soning ability and world knowledge breadth, analogous to human cognitive foundations. Professional Quotient (PQ)- Professional Expertise: Emerges from supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where models develop task-specific proficiency through instruction-response pairs. PQ measures specialized capabili- ties across diverse application domains. Emotional Quotient (EQ)-Alignment Ability: Cultivated through post-training reinforcement learning (RL), where models learn to align outputs with human values. EQ assesses emotional and eth- ical resonance with human preferences beyond mere task completion. Unlike broad \u2019knowledge\u2019 dimension in [19], our IQ evaluation explicitly quantifies foundational reason- ing and world knowledge breadth, while PQ introduces a structured evaluation of task-specific expertise, which existing frameworks neglect. Furthermore, EQ extends beyond [17]\u2019s safety-centric alignment to encompass emotional and ethical alignment with human values, ensuring outputs resonate with user preferences and societal norms. Early stages of LLM evaluation mainly focus on IQ, en- suring that the models had a broad base of world knowledge. As pre-training techniques and data engineering matured, the emphasis shifted to PQ, evaluating the model\u2019s ability to solve specific practical tasks. Now, as models become proficient in these tasks, EQ has become increasingly important. For IQ and PQ, there are well-established benchmarks such as MMLU [16], GPQA [21], MATHQA[22] for IQ, and HumanEval [23], IFEval [24] for domain-specific PQ. For EQ, while there are no strict benchmarks, tools like Alignbench [25], MT-Bench [26], and Arena-Hard [27] provide some coverage, though they often use third-party AI as evaluators, making them more aligned with AI preferences than human preferences. As depicted in Fig. 1, this review transcends conventional LLM evaluation paradigms by introducing a transformative framework, that bridges the critical gap between technical performance metrics and real-world societal impact. We pi- oneer an anthropomorphic evaluation taxonomy that funda- mentally reimagines how we assess LLM capabilities, moving beyond fragmented benchmarks toward a holistic roadmap understanding of AI intelligence. Our work establishes the first comprehensive bridge between machine cognition and human- centric value systems, positioning the evaluation not merely as a technical exercise but as a crucial determinant of responsible AI deployment.

Our tripartite IQ-EQ- PQ model (Intelligence Quotient, Emotional Quotient, and Professional Quotient) represents the first holistic approach (to our best knowledge) that simultaneously captures what LLMs know, how they apply knowledge, and why their outputs resonate with human values.

By integrating economic viability, ethical alignment, so- cial responsibility, and environmental sustainability into a unified evaluation framework, we shift the discourse from \"can it work?\" to \"should it work?\" and \"how does it benefit society?\" This represents a critical evolution from capability-focused assessment to value-driven evaluation. \u2022 Practical Implementation Blueprint: Beyond theoret- ical constructs, we deliver an actionable, step-by-step and modular evaluation system that bridges the chasm between academic research and industrial deployment. Our evaluation framework addresses the critical discon- nect between benchmark performance and real-world functionality, providing concrete strategies for evaluat- ing LLMs within complex application ecosystems (RAG systems, agents, chatbots) while accounting for the full lifecycle of model deployment and maintenance. \u2022 Future-Proof Evaluation Roadmap: We articulate a six-tiered evolutionary path for LLM evaluation that anticipates the field\u2019s trajectory over the next decade. This forward-looking perspective identifies not just cur- rent limitations but also the emerging challenges at the intersection of statistical rigor, interpretability, user expe- rience, system reliability, dynamic adaptation, and value creation\u2014providing a strategic compass for navigating the rapidly evolving landscape of AI assessment.

By analyzing these tools, we can better understand their strengths and limitations, providing recommendations for future improvements and deployments. The comprehensive analysis of these LLM evaluation har- nesses reveals a spectrum of strengths and weaknesses across several critical dimensions. When it comes to ease of use, some platforms like OpenCompass and Azure AI Studio stand out for their user-friendly interfaces, streamlining the process for both novice and experienced researchers. However, the modularity of these tools varies; FlagEval and Weights & Biases offer high levels of customization, allowing users to integrate specific components as needed, which is particularly beneficial for complex or specialized research projects. Explainability, with Arthur Bench and LangSmith provides robust mechanisms to interpret model behavior, an essential aspect for ensuring transparency and trust in AI systems. In terms of reproducibility, most of the listed tools, including SuperCLUE and DeepEval, ensure that experiments can be reliably replicated, which is fundamental for the scientific method. The open-source nature of many of these tools, such as DeepEval and Parea AI, fosters a collaborative environment. The richness of the metrics provided by these evaluation harnesses is also noteworthy. While some, like Arthur Bench and TruLens, offer a wide array of detailed performance indicators, others may focus on a more limited but still informative set.

    "of detailed performance indicators, others may focus on a more limited but still informative set. Multi-task support is another area where there\u2019s a significant difference, with Azure AI Studio and Amazon Bedrock excelling in handling a broad range of tasks, from natural language understanding to generation, thereby providing a more holistic assessment of LLMs. Speed and efficiency testing are crucial for practical ap- plications, yet not all toolkits include this feature. Tools like Azure AI Studio and Vertex AI Studio incorporate speed and resource efficiency evaluations, which are vital for real- world deployment considerations. Lastly, the ability to assess alignment and instruction following, an increasingly important aspect of LLMs, is present in select platforms, such as Arthur Bench and Prompt Flow, which provide insights into how well models adhere to human values and follow specific instructions, a critical consideration for safe and effective AI. Overall, the landscape of LLM evaluation harnesses is diverse, with each tool offering a different balance of features. Researchers and developers must carefully consider their spe- cific needs and the characteristics of the available tools when selecting the most appropriate one for their work. By lever- aging the strengths of these platforms, the field can continue to advance the quality, reliability, and applicability of LLMs, contributing to the broader goals of artificial intelligence. a) Task Support and Diversity of Objectives: The ex- isting evaluation tools cover a wide array of tasks, including direct assessment, pairwise ranking, question-answering, sum- marization, translation, and code generation. This diversity reflects the complexity and variability of real-world appli- cations. For instance, Arthur Bench supports multiple task SHELL et al.: A SAMPLE ARTICLE USING IEEETRAN.CLS FOR IEEE JOURNALS 5 types, such as QA, summarization, and translation, making it a versatile evaluation platform. Additionally, many tools allow users to customize tasks, for instance, athina-evals and PandaLM, which is valuable for specific research or industrial applications. b) Usability and Community Activity: Usability is a critical factor in determining the widespread adoption of an evaluation tool. The table indicates that most tools have achieved high standards of usability, with intuitive interfaces and documentation. For example, LightEval and autoevals are noted for their high usability, providing straightforward access for users. Some tools also integrate automated processes to further simplify the evaluation workflow. Prompt flow by Microsoft, for instance, aims to enhance product quality through simplified development processes. Community activity is another key indicator. High activ- ity typically means continuous support and updates, along with a strong user base contributing feedback and improve- ments. Projects like EVAL (OpenAI) and lm-evaluation- harness (EleutherAI) exhibit strong community engagement, which not only drives the iterative improvement of the tools but also provides a wealth of resources and support for users.",

B. Implementation Roadmap of Modular Evaluation System A modular LLM evaluation framework or harness in general consists of: benchmark or dataset hub, model hub, prompting module, metrics, monitoring and experiment management, arena or leaderboard (as shown in Fig. 3). The evaluation framework leverages distinct modules, delin- eating three primary paradigms: metrics-centered assessment, human-centered assessment (Human Judgment), and model- centered peer review (LLMs as Evaluators). In the metrics- centered assessment paradigm, task-specific performance in- dicators\u2014such as F1 score, Exact Match, and Perplexity [31]\u2014are commonly employed to ascertain the accuracy of generated outputs, particularly in classification-oriented tasks. The human-centered assessment approach emphasizes hu- man\u2019s qualitative analysis of LLM-generated content, focusing on attributes like clarity, coherence, and factual correctness [32]. Notably, there has been a surge in interest towards human evaluations utilizing the Elo rating system [33], which offers a structured methodology for comparative assessment. Since human evaluations are time-consuming, using model-centered peer review (LLMs as Evaluators) has become a popular alternative for assessing model performance. [34]. 1) Benchmark or Dataset Hub: It is crucial to select appro- priate benchmark datasets that accurately reflect the models\u2019 capabilities. Analogous to human intelligence, LLM abilities can be classified into three interrelated dimensions: General Intelligence (IQ, Intelligence Quotient), Alignment Ability (EQ, Emotional Quotient), and Professional Expertise (PQ, Professional Quotient). Correspondingly, benchmark datasets are categorized into general capability benchmarks, alignment benchmarks, and domain-specific benchmarks. General capa- bility benchmarks serve as foundational assessments, often employed at the time of an LLM\u2019s release to gauge its broad-spectrum performance (e.g., MMLU [35], HumanEval [36]). Domain-specific benchmarks focus on specialized areas, evaluating LLMs\u2019 proficiency in particular fields such as telecommunications with TeleQnA [37]. Furthermore, align- ment benchmarks scrutinize LLMs\u2019 adherence to diverse tasks and ethical guidelines, exemplified by AlignBench [25]. Addi- tional benchmarks like FOFO [38] assess specific competen- cies, such as format-following capabilities. Detailed descrip- tions of each category are provided in Section III. 2) Model Hub: This section provides insights into various models, ensuring a fair evaluation by mitigating risks such as data contamination and avoiding biased comparisons. It addresses considerations for selecting models based on their training methodologies, access to external resources, and fine- tuning on specific benchmarks versus pre-training only. 3) Prompting Module: After selecting suitable benchmarks and models, the subsequent step involves designing prompts and configuring decoding parameters for response generation. In the prompt design phase, decisions are made regarding the type of prompting strategy\u2014whether zero-shot,",
    "access to external resources, and fine- tuning on specific benchmarks versus pre-training only. 3) Prompting Module: After selecting suitable benchmarks and models, the subsequent step involves designing prompts and configuring decoding parameters for response generation. In the prompt design phase, decisions are made regarding the type of prompting strategy\u2014whether zero-shot, few-shot, or chain-of-thought\u2014to employ. The configuration of decoding parameters, including temperature settings, plays a critical role in optimizing model output. Proper setup ensures that the evaluation not only tests the LLM\u2019s inherent capabilities but also its adaptability under varying conditions. 4) Metrics Module: The evaluation of LLMs necessitates the selection of appropriate metrics that align with specific applications and intended use cases. Given the broad spec- trum of LLM applications, from machine translation and text summarization to conversational agents, the choice of evaluation metrics would be beneficial to not only reflect technical performance, but also be closely tied to business needs and application contexts. An effective evaluation frame- work allows researchers and developers to gain deep insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs, guiding further improvements and optimizations. The evaluation requires a dual focus on technical performance and business impact. Technical metrics assess the model\u2019s linguistic and functional capabilities, while business metrics measure user engagement, operational efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. (1) Technical Metrics: The choice of metrics would be closely aligned with the application. For instance, in machine trans- lation, where the goal is to generate translations that are both accurate and fluent, metrics such as BLEU [39] and METEOR [40] have been widely adopted. These token overlap-based metrics measure the n-gram overlap between the generated text and the reference, providing an indication of how well the model\u2019s output matches human-generated translations. In contrast, for tasks like sentiment analysis, precision, recall, and F1 score become more relevant, as they focus on the model\u2019s ability to correctly classify the sentiment of a given text. Considering the diverse range of LLM applications\u2014from machine translation and summarization to dialogue systems and code generation\u2014it is essential to adopt a multi-layered evaluation framework that reflects the linguistic phenomena at play. Table II presents a taxonomy of technical metrics for LLM evaluation, organized into five broad levels: (1) Lexical and Morphological, (2) Syntactic, (3) Semantic, (4) Pragmatic and Discourse, and (5) Factuality and Explainability. 6 JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 Model Hub Data Hub Metrics Llama2 DeepSeek Claude Qwen chatGLM BLOOM Yi GPT Mixtral Gemini Mamba ...

Lexical and Morphological Metrics: These metrics focus on token- or character-level correspondence and morphological variation. Traditional n-gram overlap measures such as BLEU [39] and ROUGE-N/L [41] quantify the proportion of exact contiguous matches between hypothesis and reference, while edit-distance scores like Translation Error Rate (TER) gauge the minimal sequence of insertions, deletions, and substitutions required to transform one string into another. Complement- ing these, word-order distances\u2014including RIBES [42] and Kendall\u2019s \u03c4 \u2014penalize token reordering, providing insight into the impact of syntactic shifts on surface similarity. For tasks sensitive to finer-grained discrepancies, character error rate (CER) and word error rate (WER) compute the frequen- cies of low-level insertion, deletion, and substitution errors, as commonly used in ASR and OCR evaluation. Subword- overlap metrics such as chrF [43] and BPE-F1 further refine this analysis by measuring similarity over character n-grams or byte-pair encoded segments, thus capturing partial matches that evade pure token-level statistics. Syntactic Metrics: it assesses the preservation of grammat- ical structure and targeted syntactic phenomena. Constituency and dependency parse-tree matching metrics\u2014PARSEVAL [44] precision, recall, and F1 for bracket structures, along- side Unlabeled and Labeled Attachment Scores (UAS/LAS) [45] for dependency relations\u2014offer a principled basis for comparing predicted and gold parses. To probe a model\u2019s command of specific constructions, targeted syntactic eval- uation frameworks such as Targeted Syntactic Evaluation (TSE) [46] deploy minimal-pair sentences to test capabilities like subject\u2013verb agreement, while syntactic tree-edit distance measures the minimal sequence of tree operations to align two parse trees, yielding a granular account of structural divergence. Semantic Metrics: At semantic level, evaluation em- phasizes meaning preservation, inference, and fidelity. Embedding-based approaches\u2014BERTScore [47], MoverScore [48], BLEURT [49], COMET [50], and similar meth- ods\u2014leverage contextualized vectors extracted from pre- trained models to compute cosine similarities or Earth Mover\u2019s distances, thus capturing nuanced semantic alignment between hypothesis and reference. Entailment-driven metrics such as the Document-Aware Entailment model (DAE) [51] treats the generation task as a natural language inference problem, classifying whether outputs are entailed by, neutral to, or con- tradictory with source texts. Question-answering frameworks, including QuestEval [52] and QAFactEval [53], automatically generate questions from the source or candidate summary",
    "metrics such as the Document-Aware Entailment model (DAE) [51] treats the generation task as a natural language inference problem, classifying whether outputs are entailed by, neutral to, or con- tradictory with source texts. Question-answering frameworks, including QuestEval [52] and QAFactEval [53], automatically generate questions from the source or candidate summary and compare model-predicted answers to gold responses, thereby quantifying semantic fidelity via answer accuracy. Specialized LLM-based judges\u2014either prompt-based few-shot evaluators or fine-tuned discrimination models\u2014have emerged as learn- able arbiters of output quality, scoring on dimensions such as factuality, coherence, and naturalness [54]. Pragmatic and Discourse Metrics: The metrics in this part capture coherence, cohesion, style, and diversity across larger textual spans. Entity Grid models [55] track the distribution and syntactic roles of discourse entities across sentences to quantify thematic coherence, while Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) tree comparisons [56] evaluate whether logical and rhetorical relations are preserved. Readability and stylistic consistency are measured by indices such as Flesch\u2013Kincaid readability tests [57] combine sentence length and word complexity into difficulty scores, alongside formality and sentiment metrics [58] that assess register and affective tone. To detect degeneracy and encourage lexical variety, diversity measures like distinct-n [59] compute the proportion of unique n-grams in the generated text, whereas [60] quantify the recurrence of identical n-grams within and across sentences. Factuality & Explainability Metrics: Factual consistency metrics such as FactCC [61] verify whether key propositions in the generated output align with source material. Calibra- tion and uncertainty metrics, including Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), measure discrepancies between predicted probabilities and observed accuracy, while entropy-based measures of predictive and semantic uncertainty signal where the model is least confident. By selecting and combining technical metrics, we can gain a deeper understanding of models\u2019 strengths and weaknesses, leading to more informed decisions in the development and deployment of LLMs. Future work may focus on developing more sophisticated and context-aware metrics that can better capture the nuances of natural language, thus bridging the gap between automatic evaluations and human judgment. (2) Business Metrics: Evaluating a system\u2019s performance and impact on business is multifaceted. The metrics used to gauge the success of an LLM application can be broadly categorized SHELL et al.: A SAMPLE ARTICLE USING IEEETRAN.CLS FOR IEEE JOURNALS 7 TABLE II: Basic Metrics Taxonomy for LLM Evaluation (Technical vs. Business).

Each category provides insights into the operational efficiency and user experience. User Engagement and Utility Metrics: Both are funda- mental in assessing the initial attractiveness and usability of an LLM application. These metrics include the number of users who visited the LLM app feature, submitted prompts, received responses without errors, viewed responses, and clicked on reference documentation provided by the LLM. A high rate of visits and submissions indicates a strong interest and active use of the LLM, while the absence of",
    "metrics include the number of users who visited the LLM app feature, submitted prompts, received responses without errors, viewed responses, and clicked on reference documentation provided by the LLM. A high rate of visits and submissions indicates a strong interest and active use of the LLM, while the absence of errors and the viewing of responses suggest that the LLM is providing value to its users. Clicks on reference documentation can also indicate that the LLM is effectively guiding users towards additional resources, enhancing their overall experience. User Interaction Metrics: These metrics delve deeper into how users engage with the LLM over time. The frequency of user acceptance, the average number of LLM conversations per user, the number of active days using LLM features, and the average interaction timing all provide a comprehensive view of user behavior. For instance, a higher user acceptance rate, especially in conversational scenarios, suggests that the LLM is meeting or exceeding user expectations. Monitoring the average number of conversations and active days can help identify power users and potential areas for improvement. Interaction timing, including the latency between prompts and responses, is crucial for ensuring that the LLM remains responsive and engaging. Response Quality Metrics : This is paramount for main- taining user trust and satisfaction. Average lengths of prompts and responses, as well as edit distance metrics, offer quanti- tative measures of the LLM\u2019s ability to generate coherent and relevant content. Edit distance metrics, in particular, can serve as an indicator of the degree of customization and refinement in the LLM\u2019s output, reflecting its adaptability to user needs. High-quality responses not only improve user experience but also contribute to the LLM\u2019s reputation and credibility. Feedback and Retention Metrics: Direct feedback like thumbs up/down ratings, is invaluable for understanding user sentiment and making data-driven improvements. Additionally, tracking daily, weekly, and monthly active users, along with user return rate, helps in assessing the stickiness of the LLM application. A high return rate indicates that the LLM is delivering consistent value, encouraging users to continue using. Analyzing these metrics can guide the development of strategies to enhance user retention and satisfaction. Performance Metrics: Performance metrics are essential 8 JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 for ensuring that the LLM operates efficiently and reliably. As supported in LLMPerf, key performance indicators include requests per second (concurrency), tokens per second, time to first token render, error rates, reliability, and latency. These metrics provide a practical overview of the LLM\u2019s capabilities, helping to identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization. For example, a low error rate and high reliability are indicative of a robust and stable system, while minimizing latency ensures a smooth and responsive user",
    "render, error rates, reliability, and latency. These metrics provide a practical overview of the LLM\u2019s capabilities, helping to identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization. For example, a low error rate and high reliability are indicative of a robust and stable system, while minimizing latency ensures a smooth and responsive user experience. Cost Metrics: GPU/CPU utilization, LLM calls cost, in- frastructure cost, and operation cost all contribute to the total cost of ownership. By monitoring these costs, organizations can make informed decisions about resource allocation and scaling. For instance, optimizing GPU/CPU utilization can lead to cost savings, while carefully managing infrastructure and operation costs ensures LLMs economically viable. A comprehensive evaluation of an LLM system requires a balanced approach that considers both qualitative and quanti- tative aspects. By leveraging the metrics outlined in Table II, businesses can gain a holistic understanding of their LLM\u2019s performance, enabling them to continuously refine and im- prove the service to meet the evolving needs of their users. 5) Tasks Module: The Tasks Module is a critical compo- nent within the evaluation framework for LLMs, designed to systematically assess model performance across a wide array of tasks. This module aims to provide a comprehensive and diverse set of challenges that can effectively evaluate various aspects of LLM capabilities, including language understand- ing, reasoning, and generation, etc. The selection of tasks is crucial as it directly influences the breadth and depth of the evaluation, guaranteeing that models undergo evaluation in situations closely resembling practical applications. To achieve this goal, the Tasks Module incorporates both conventional and innovative tasks. Conventional tasks include those found in established benchmarks such as GLUE [12], which focus on natural language understanding. However, recognizing the limitations of these benchmarks, newer frame- works like BIG-bench [64] have expanded the scope to include more complex and varied challenges. These tasks are designed to push the boundaries of what LLMs can do, thereby identi- fying areas where further improvements are needed. Moreover, the Tasks Module emphasizes the importance of real-world applicability. For instance, HELM [54] introduces a hierarchical categorization framework which spans 16 dis- tinct scenarios, each represented by <task, domain, language> triples. This approach ensures that evaluations cover a broad spectrum of user-oriented tasks, from simple instructions to intricate reasoning problems. Additionally, OpenCompass [30] extends its scope beyond traditional areas like language and reasoning to encompass comprehension and subject-specific evaluations, offering a more holistic view of LLM capabilities. The inclusion of dynamic and adaptable tasks is another hallmark of modern evaluation frameworks. FlagEval [65], for example, allows users to dynamically combine capabilities, tasks, and metrics into ternary groups, significantly enhancing the flexibility and adaptability of the evaluation process. This modular design enables researchers to tailor",
    "of LLM capabilities. The inclusion of dynamic and adaptable tasks is another hallmark of modern evaluation frameworks. FlagEval [65], for example, allows users to dynamically combine capabilities, tasks, and metrics into ternary groups, significantly enhancing the flexibility and adaptability of the evaluation process. This modular design enables researchers to tailor evaluations to specific needs or emerging trends in LLM development. Thus, the Tasks Module serves as a cornerstone for evalu- ating LLMs, providing a structured yet flexible environment that can accommodate both established and new challenges. By continuously updating and refining the task set, it plays a pivotal role in advancing the SOTA in LLM technology. 6) Leaderboards and Arena Module: The Leaderboards and Arena Module represents an essential tool for bench- marking and comparing LLMs in a transparent and com- petitive manner. Leaderboards offer a standardized platform where models can be evaluated against predefined datasets and metrics, while Arenas introduce a more interactive approach, leveraging human preferences to rank models based on direct comparisons [66]. Together, these modules facilitate a deeper understanding of LLM performance and promote continuous improvement within the research community. Leaderboards, such as those provided by Hugging Face\u2019s Open LLM Leaderboard, serve as centralized repositories for sharing and comparing evaluation results. They typi- cally highlight key datasets like ARC [67], HellaSwag [68], MMLU [16], and TruthfulQA [69], selected for their ability to challenge LLMs in different ways. By making evaluation results public, leaderboards foster transparency and encourage collaborative efforts towards improving LLM technologies. Arenas, on the other hand, adopt a more interactive eval- uation paradigm. Platforms like Chatbot Arena [66] allow users to compare outputs from multiple LLMs for a given query, using human preferences as the primary metric. The Elo scoring mechanism is employed to dynamically adjust scores based on user feedback, providing a scalable and adaptive ranking system. It not only streamlines the evaluation process but also captures nuanced differences in performance that might not be evident by automated metrics alone. By engaging the broader community, the Arena Module enhances the relevance and reliability of evaluations, ensuring that models are judged based on their actual utility rather than just theoretical benchmarks. Furthermore, the Arena Module addresses some of the limitations inherent in static leader- boards. While leaderboards provide a snapshot of performance at a given time, arenas offer ongoing assessments that evolve with user interactions. This dynamic nature helps maintain the integrity and relevance of evaluations, reducing the risk of data leakage and ensuring that benchmarks remain challenging and informative. Therefore, the Leaderboards and Arena Module complements the Tasks Module by providing both standard- ized and interactive platforms for evaluating LLMs. 7) Analysis Module: It is designed to interpret and syn- thesize the extensive",

Therefore, the Leaderboards and Arena Module complements the Tasks Module by providing both standard- ized and interactive platforms for evaluating LLMs. 7) Analysis Module: It is designed to interpret and syn- thesize the extensive data generated during evaluations. This module integrates advanced analytical techniques to provide meaningful insights into model performance, thereby guid- ing future improvements and informing strategic decisions regarding LLM deployment. Specifically, it addresses critical areas such as Monitoring, Logs, Experiment Management, Visualization, and Statistics, each of which plays an essential role in ensuring comprehensive and actionable evaluations. Monitoring is essential to tracking the performance of LLMs during evaluation. Continuous monitoring allows evalu- ators to detect anomalies or deviations from expected behavior promptly.

Monitoring also facilitates early detection of issues related to computational resources, enabling timely adjustments to optimize efficiency. Moreover, continuous mon- itoring supports iterative development cycles. Logs serve as a record of interactions between LLMs and the evaluation environment, capturing inputs, outputs, and in- termediate states. They are indispensable for post-hoc analysis and debugging. It also plays a role in auditing and compliance, ensuring that evaluations adhere to ethical standards and regulatory requirements. By maintaining thorough logs, the Analysis Module enhances transparency and accountability. Experiment Management is vital for systematic evalua- tions. It involves defining protocols, managing datasets, and controlling variables to ensure reproducibility and compara- bility of results. Platforms like OpenCompass [30] offer ver- satile experimental settings, including zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) configurations, allowing researchers to explore different facets of LLM capabilities. Effective experiment management also includes version control and documentation practices, ensuring that each experiment can be replicated or extended by other researchers. Visualization tools transform complex evaluation data into 10 JOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021 intuitive and accessible formats, enhancing the interpretability of results. The LLM Comparator [123] provides an interactive table and visualization summary that enable users to inspect individual prompts and their responses in detail. These visual aids facilitate the identification of trends, outliers, and corre- lations, supporting deeper analyses. Visualization also plays a key role in communicating findings to stakeholders who may not have technical expertise, ensuring that insights from evaluations are widely understood and acted upon. Statistical analysis. Techniques such as hypothesis test- ing, regression analysis, and confidence interval estimation are employed to quantify uncertainties and validate findings. Statistical rigor also helps in identifying significant factors influencing model performance, informing strategies for op- timization and enhancement. By applying robust statistical practices, the Analysis Module ensures that evaluations yield accurate and trustworthy insights. III. ANTHROPOMORPHIC EVALUATION: IQ, PQ, EQ It necessitates to draw an analogy with human intelli- gence, categorizing their abilities into three interconnected dimensions: General Intelligence (IQ, Intelligence Quotient), Alignment Ability (EQ, Emotional Quotient), and Professional Expertise (PQ, Professional Quotient). It allows us to gain a more nuanced and easier understanding of their performance in practical scenarios. It also provides guidance to the enhance- ment of their cognitive, social, and professional competencies. A.

    "of their cognitive, social, and professional competencies. A. General Intelligence Evaluation (IQ) General Intelligence of an LLM refers to its foundational cognitive capabilities (IQ). It encompasses the model\u2019s ability to understand, reason, and learn from a wide array of textual data. This includes the capacity for language comprehension, logical reasoning, and the generation of coherent and contextu- ally appropriate responses. The IQ of an LLM is analogous to the human mind\u2019s ability to process information from various domains and to apply general knowledge flexibly. Crucially, IQ corresponds to capabilities developed during pre-training, where models acquire foundational knowledge through self- supervised learning on massive corpora, reflecting the breadth of world knowledge and reasoning ability that forms the bedrock of LLM performance. Different benchmarks offer diverse perspectives through their unique approaches and task types (Table III). The MMLU benchmark [35] encompasses a diverse array of 57 tasks span- ning multiple domains such as elementary mathematics, Amer- ican history, computer science, and law. MMLU-Pro [16], an improved version of MMLU, enhances question quality and accuracy by reducing noise and providing a more detailed assessment of models\u2019 reasoning abilities. MMLU-Pro+ [124] extends its predecessor by evaluating shortcut learning and advanced reasoning capabilities in LLMs. MMLU-Pro+ retains the challenging nature of MMLU-Pro and enhances the as- sessment of model discernment, especially in situations where multiple correct answers are possible. MMLU-Redux [125] improves the quality and precision of questions through careful curation, leading to a more accurate evaluation. In contrast, BBH (Big-Bench Hard) is a subset of BIG- Bench, focusing on the most challenging tasks that require multi-step reasoning, spanning a broad spectrum of fields such as mathematics, logic, and commonsense reasoning, aiming to evaluate models\u2019 performance in complex tasks [64]. ARC-C (AI2 Reasoning Challenge - Challenge Set) is dedicated to testing models\u2019 ability to answer complex scientific questions that require logical reasoning, covering science questions from elementary to high school levels, with the goal of assessing models\u2019 scientific reasoning capabilities [126]. TruthfulQA is designed to evaluate the truthfulness of models when answering questions prone to generating false beliefs and biases, using a series of carefully crafted questions to test the reliability and accuracy [69]. Winogrande is a large-scale coreference resolution task that tests models\u2019 ability to handle contextual understanding in sentences through a series of com- plex questions [110]. HellaSwag evaluates natural language inference by requiring models to complete paragraphs in a way that necessitates understanding complex details, aimed at assessing models\u2019 commonsense reasoning abilities [68]. Besides, RV-Bench [127] evaluates LLMs\u2019 mathematical rea- soning by using random variable questions, which require models to understand the underlying problem structure rather than relying on memorized solutions.

Besides, RV-Bench [127] evaluates LLMs\u2019 mathematical rea- soning by using random variable questions, which require models to understand the underlying problem structure rather than relying on memorized solutions. While IQ benchmarks have proliferated, significant chal- lenges persist. First, the \"memorization vs. reasoning\" dilemma complicates assessment\u2014models often succeed through pattern matching rather than genuine understanding. Second, the rapid capability growth of LLMs has rendered many benchmarks obsolete, creating a \"red queen\" effect where benchmarks quickly become saturated. Third, most IQ assessments remain narrow in scope, failing to capture the full spectrum of human-like reasoning capabilities. Recent studies reveal that even state-of-the-art models struggle with counterfactual reasoning and maintaining consistency across extended dialogues, highlighting gaps in current evaluation methodologies. B. Professional Expertise Evaluation (PQ) PQ represents the specialized knowledge and skills that an LLM possesses within a particular area. It is akin to the professional acumen that a human expert might have in a specific field. PQ in LLMs is evident in their ability to provide detailed, accurate, and nuanced information within a specialized domain, such as healthcare, financial. Notably, PQ corresponds to capabilities acquired during supervised fine-tuning, where models develop domain-specific expertise through targeted instruction-response learning, forming the operational foundation for specialized LLM applications. Table IV shows recent domain-specific evaluation bench- marks, along with additional comparative dimensions such as the scope of tasks, data sources, and unique contributions. This table excludes the introductory descriptions for brevity and focuses on key attributes that facilitate a comparative analysis. 1) Healthcare: The healthcare domain has seen the devel- opment of specialized benchmarks to evaluate LLMs (LLMs) in medical applications, each with unique features contribut- ing to comprehensive evaluation.

Collectively, these benchmarks provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating LLMs\u2019 capabilities in the science domain. They highlight not only the importance of scientific creativity and literature analysis but also emphasize practical aspects such as hands-on experimentation, hypothesis testing, and ethical considerations. For instance, LiveIdeaBench [157] and SciAssess [163] offer unique methodologies for assessing divergent thinking and innovative idea generation, indicating that LLMs require distinct evaluation approaches beyond tra- ditional memory and understanding. On the other hand, Dis- coveryWorld [160] and ProtocoLLM [161] focus on practical skills, underscoring the significance of experimental design and hypothesis formation, which are essential for cultivating LLMs\u2019 actual research capabilities. Furthermore, SciVerse [164] and SciSafeEval [162] extend the evaluation scope to include multi-modal reasoning and safety alignment, ensuring that LLMs can effectively handle complex datasets while adhering to ethical standards. Collectively, these benchmarks guide the development of more advanced LLMs, ultimately contributing to accelerating scientific innovation and discovery. C. Alignment Ability Evaluation (EQ) The concept of Alignment Ability, often referred to as Emotional Quotient (EQ) in the context of LLMs, is a critical aspect of evaluating how well these models can understand and appropriately respond to the emotional and social nuances within human interactions.

    "of evaluating how well these models can understand and appropriately respond to the emotional and social nuances within human interactions. This evaluation is essential for ensuring that LLMs not only generate text that is coherent and relevant but also that they do so in a manner that is empathetic, culturally sensitive, and ethically sound [204]. Specifically, EQ corresponds to capabilities refined through reinforcement learning from human feedback, where models learn to align outputs with human values, ensuring socially appropriate and SHELL et al.: A SAMPLE ARTICLE USING IEEETRAN.CLS FOR IEEE JOURNALS 13 ethically sound interactions. As shown in Table V, benchmarks have been developed to assess the EQ of LLMs, each focusing on different aspects of emotional intelligence. For instance, EQ-Bench [181] is a notable benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the emo- tional intelligence of LLMs. It challenges the models to predict the intensity of emotional states of characters in a dialogue, thereby assessing their ability to understand complex emotions and social interactions. The EQ-Bench dataset consists of 171 carefully crafted questions, providing a robust framework for measuring the emotional acumen of LLMs. Meanwhile, Align- Bench includes a comprehensive multi-dimensional approach to evaluating the alignment of LLMs with human intent [25], it encompasses a wide range of categories, including reliability, and it uses a combination of 683 real-scenario rooted queries and corresponding human-verified references to ensure that the evaluation reflects actual usage contexts. This benchmark allows for a nuanced assessment of model performance across various dimensions, such as creativity, logic, and sensitivity. RewardBench [29] and TrustLLM [180] are also notewor- thy, as they focus on different facets of alignment. Reward- Bench evaluates the reward modeling capabilities of LLMs, which is crucial for understanding and following instructions, while TrustLLM measures the trustworthiness of models, an essential component of user confidence and safety. These benchmarks, along with others like IFEval [24] and LLMBar [178], which concentrate on instruction following, provide a comprehensive suite of tools for researchers and developers to measure and improve the alignment of LLMs with human ex- pectations. Besides, the Fairness benchmark [173] and CASE- Bench [172] both highlight the importance of aligning LLMs with human values. The Fairness benchmark evaluates LLMs\u2019 alignment with distributive fairness concepts like equitability and envy-freeness, revealing a lack of alignment with human preferences. CASE-Bench focuses on safety, integrating con- text into safety assessments and showing context\u2019s significant influence on human judgments. Both underscore the need for LLMs to better align with societal norms [205]. IV.

VALUE-ORIENTED EVALUATION OF LLMS Extant works predominantly employ conventional perfor- mance metrics to assess LLMs. However, these metrics are frequently insufficient to encapsulate the complex societal, economic, ethical, and environmental repercussions of deploy- ing LLMs. Recent studies have begun to explore alternative evaluation frameworks that consider a broader spectrum of impacts, signaling a shift towards more holistic assessments. As shown in Fig. 4, this section delves into a value-oriented evaluation framework for LLMs, which transcends conven- tional performance benchmarks to encompass a holistic assess- ment including economic, social, ethical, and environmental considerations. By advocating for an evaluation approach that not only quantifies technical proficiency but also qualifies the broader implications of LLM deployment, this paper aims to contribute to the discourse on responsible AI development. a) Economic Value: We give some key metrics: Cost- Benefit Ratio (CBR): This metric evaluates the ratio of the Fig. 4: Value-oriented Evaluation for LLMs. benefits derived from the model to the costs incurred in its development and deployment. A higher CBR indicates a more economically viable solution. Return on Investment (ROI): it measures the financial return generated by the model relative to the initial investment. It provides a clear indication of the model\u2019s profitability and long-term financial viability.

For instance, in a business setting, an LLM that automates customer service can significantly reduce response times and improve efficiency. Market Acceptance (MA): Market acceptance is a qualitative metric that gauges the level of adoption and user satisfaction with the model. High market acceptance suggests that the model meets the needs and expectations of its target audience. b) Social Value: The following metrics are used to eval- uate social value: User Satisfaction (US): User satisfaction is a direct measure of how well the model meets the needs and preferences of its users. Surveys and feedback mechanisms can be employed to gather this data. Knowledge Dissemi- nation Efficiency (KDE): it measures the effectiveness of the model in spreading knowledge and information. In educational settings, for example, an LLM that can generate high-quality learning materials can significantly enhance the dissemination of knowledge. Public Service Improvement (PSI): it evalu- ates the extent to which the model improves the quality and efficiency of public services. Case studies and expert reviews can provide insights into the model\u2019s impact on public service delivery. Education Quality Improvement (EQI): it assesses the contribution of the model to enhancing the quality of education. Metrics such as student performance and teacher feedback can be used to quantify this improvement. c) Ethical Value: Ethical considerations are paramount in",

LLM SYSTEM OR APPLICATION EVALUATION In this section, we delve into the intricacies of evaluating LLM systems and applications, exploring the methodologies, metrics, and benchmarks that are pivotal in ensuring the advancement and responsible deployment of these powerful AI tools. It also focuses on three pivotal areas: Retrieval- Augmented Generation (RAG), AI Agents, and Chatbots. A. RAG Evaluation Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a pivotal approach to enhancing the capabilities of LLMs by integrating retrieval mechanisms with generative processes [28]. The evaluation of RAG models focuses on the model\u2019s ability to incorporate retrieved information seamlessly into its responses[206]. This assessment goes beyond merely judging the quality of the generated text, it also scrutinizes the preci- sion and relevance of the retrieved data, alongside how well this information complements and enriches the final output. Key performance indicators for RAG systems typically en- compass the retrieval process\u2019s accuracy and completeness, as well as the logical consistency and contextual appropriateness of the augmented content. Table VI provides a comprehen- sive overview of various benchmarks designed to assess the performance of RAG systems across diverse domains. The diversity of evaluation aspects and metrics employed by these frameworks highlights the multifaceted nature of RAG assessment. For instance, RAGAS from Exploding Gradients focuses on automated evaluation through customized metrics that measure answer relevance, context relevance, and faithful- ness [206]. It is particularly valuable for its ability to evaluate the alignment between retrieved contexts and generated an- swers, ensuring that the output remains grounded in factual information. Similarly, BERGEN emphasizes consistency in benchmarking RAG pipelines, addressing the challenge of inconsistent evaluations",
    "measure answer relevance, context relevance, and faithful- ness [206]. It is particularly valuable for its ability to evaluate the alignment between retrieved contexts and generated an- swers, ensuring that the output remains grounded in factual information. Similarly, BERGEN emphasizes consistency in benchmarking RAG pipelines, addressing the challenge of inconsistent evaluations that can hinder comparative analysis [217]. By leveraging HuggingFace for reproducibility and integration, BERGEN facilitates a standardized approach to evaluating RAG systems, thereby promoting transparency and comparability in research findings. Table VII encapsulates a range of evaluation metrics essential for assessing the perfor- mance of LLMs (LLMs). Each metric serves a distinct pur- pose, contributing to a comprehensive evaluation framework that ensures models are not only technically proficient but also contextually relevant and factually accurate. These metrics together form a robust evaluation framework that supports the development and deployment of LLMs by offering detailed insights into their performance across dimensions. On the other hand, CRAG introduces a benchmark to simulate web and Knowledge Graph (KG) search, covering a wide array of question types and domains [208]. Such extensive coverage allows researchers to explore the robustness and versatility of RAG systems under varying conditions. In contrast, raga-llm-hub offers a comprehensive toolkit with over 100 evaluation metrics, focusing on multiple dimensions such as relevance, quality, safety, and more [218].

    "Task completion on the web Yes No No assessment ensures that developers can thoroughly evaluate LLMs and RAG applications, identifying areas for improve- ment and optimizing performance. For practical use, ARES exemplifies this transition by providing an automatic evaluation framework that includes human-annotated datasets for scoring context relevance, an- swer faithfulness, and answer relevance [210]. The use of annotated data enhances the reliability of evaluations, offering insights into both the strengths and weaknesses of RAG systems. Moreover, RGB [211] focuses on four fundamental capabilities: negative rejection, noise robustness, counterfac- tual robustness, and information integration. BEIR focus on out-of-distribution and zero-shot tasks underscores the im- portance of adaptability in RAG systems, preparing them for scenarios where prior knowledge may be limited [212]. Meanwhile, ALCE [213] emphasizes on citation quality and correctness addresses concerns about hallucinations, ensuring that generated content adheres to established facts and sources. B. Agent Evaluation The advent of LLMs has led to advancements in AI Agents capable of autonomously interacting with various environ- ments and tools. To ensure that these agents meet the desired standards, a variety of evaluation frameworks have emerged [219, 220, 221, 222]. Each framework targets different aspects of Agent performance, such as tool usage, decision-making, role-playing, and multi-modal interaction. Table VIII compares several key benchmarks across multiple dimensions, highlight- ing their unique contributions to the field. AgentBench [220] and API-Bank [221] emphasize evaluat- ing Agents across diverse real-world scenarios, including cod- ing, gaming, web interactions, and tool invocations. This broad scope ensures that Agents are tested under conditions closely resembling their intended operational environments, providing valuable feedback on their generalization capabilities. Metrics play a crucial role in assessing Agent performance. For example, AgentBoard [222] introduces novel metrics such as process rate and grounding accuracy, offering deeper insights into how effectively Agents handle complex tasks. Meanwhile, MMRole [226] evaluates multimodal interaction through detailed criteria considering both textual and visual elements, ensuring a more holistic assessment. Moreover, new entries like BFCL [228] focus on function- calling tasks, including multi-task and parallel function calls, challenging the Agents\u2019 ability to handle complex logic. ToolLLM [65] enables LLMs to master over 16,000 real- world APIs, while ToolBench [231] assesses the capability of Agents to manipulate software tools used in real-world tasks. Webarena [230] creates realistic web environments for Agents to complete various web-based tasks. The GLEE [227] frame- work focuses on agents\u2019 behavior within economic contexts, using parameters such as parameterization, degrees of free- dom, and economic measures to evaluate agent performance. This highlights the importance of understanding societal and economic activities. The lack of standardized evaluation meth- ods remains a challenge. Frameworks like PersonaGym [225] introduce scoring systems, such as PersonaScore, which could pave the way for establishing",

The lack of standardized evaluation meth- ods remains a challenge. Frameworks like PersonaGym [225] introduce scoring systems, such as PersonaScore, which could pave the way for establishing industry-wide standards. C. ChatBot Evaluation The assessment of modern chatbot systems, particularly those based on LLMs, requires multidimensional frameworks addressing linguistic coherence, contextual understanding, and ethical considerations (Table IX). As conversational AI evolves from single-turn responses to multi-party dialogues, traditional evaluation metrics such as BLEU [39] and ROUGE [41] prove insufficient for capturing the complexity of human-like interactions. This section analyzes state-of-the-art benchmarks across 3 critical dimensions: dialogue quality, fairness and human interaction patterns. Dialogue Quality Assessment: it focuses on structural, lin- guistic, and contextual dimensions. BotChatBenchmark [232] introduces the ChatSEED methodology, where real-world di- alogue snippets serve as prompts for LLMs to generate full- length conversations. Using GPT-4 as a meta-judge, this frame- work reveals significant performance disparities: while GPT-4 achieves top consistency with human dialogues, open-source models like Llama2-70B exhibit suboptimal verbosity errors. MT-Bench-101 [233] extends this analysis through a three-tier taxonomy covering 13 tasks, exposing critical failure modes in error recovery and instruction-following. Besides, the MT- Bench framework [33] establishes human judgment standards, demonstrating that crowd-sourced evaluations correlate with expert assessments. For question-answering systems, CoQA [239] and QuAC [240] employ F1/ROUGE metrics, revealing that models struggle with pronoun resolution. Fairness Evaluation: FairMT-Bench [234] constructs a 10K-dialogue dataset spanning gender, ethnicity, and occu- pational biases, showing that LLMs exhibit up to 37% per- formance variance across sensitive scenarios.

Their \u201cwisdom of crowds\" metric reveals that model rankings change over benchmark mixtures. Human Interaction Patterns: Human interaction analysis emphasizes real-world dynamics. Chatbot Arena [66] collects 33K competitive dialogues through a crowdsourced platform, demonstrating that closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4) outper- form open-source alternatives in user preference scores. MT- Eval [235] identifies four interaction patterns\u2014recollection, expansion, refinement, and follow-up\u2014showing that error propagation increases in multi-turn settings. WildChat [238] provides unprecedented scale with 1M ChatGPT interactions, revealing different user behaviors. VI. CHALLENGES AND OUTLOOK We propose a six-tiered challenges and future opportunities: starting from foundational methodological concerns (statistical rigor and reproducibility), advancing through technical eval- uation complexities (composite metrics and interpretability), extending to application-level considerations (user experience and human-in-the-loop assessment), encompassing system- level evaluation (pragmatic system analysis and failure ex- ploration), adapting to evolutionary dynamics (dynamic eval- uation mechanisms), and ultimately reaching value-oriented dimensions (economic, social, ethical, and environmental im- pacts). This structure reflects how LLM evaluation must evolve from purely technical assessments toward holistic frameworks. a) Enhanced Statistical Analysis for LLM Evaluation: Current evaluation practices suffer from a critical methodolog- ical gap: the lack of rigorous statistical foundations necessary for reliable performance assessment. Most benchmarks report point estimates without confidence intervals, making it difficult to determine whether observed performance differences rep- resent genuine capability improvements or merely statistical noise. Integrating rigorous statistical methods is essential to transform LLM evaluation from simplistic scoring to scientif- ically valid methodology for reliable model development. b) Composite Evaluation/Ranking Systems: Developing composite and comprehensive evaluation/ranking systems rep- resents the necessary evolution beyond basic statistical rigor. Current evaluation methods often focus on specific tasks or benchmarks, which may not fully capture the multifaceted capabilities of LLMs. A composite system that integrates various metrics and evaluation criteria can provide a more nuanced and comprehensive assessment. c) Interpretability and Explainability: One fundamental challenge in evaluating LLMs is the alignment between the fine-grained decision-making logic of the models and human cognition. Current evaluation practices often focus on the correctness of the output, merely addressing hallucination and value alignment issues. However, in practical industrial applications, the crux of assessing the credibility of LLMs lies in the correctness of the underlying decision logic that leads to the output. This is particularly challenging because, even though LLMs may exhibit high accuracy on specific tasks, their internal decision logic can be highly chaotic and misaligned with human reasoning. Developing explainable AI (XAI) techniques",
    "credibility of LLMs lies in the correctness of the underlying decision logic that leads to the output. This is particularly challenging because, even though LLMs may exhibit high accuracy on specific tasks, their internal decision logic can be highly chaotic and misaligned with human reasoning. Developing explainable AI (XAI) techniques specifically tailored for LLMs can enhance transparency and facilitate better human-AI collaboration. d) User-Centric Experience as a Benchmark: Moving beyond purely technical assessments, user-centric experience represents a crucial application-level consideration. Traditional benchmarks often focus on technical performance metrics, which may not fully capture the user\u2019s perspective. Incorpo- rating user feedback and usability testing can provide more valuable insights into the practical utility and user satisfaction of LLMs. This can be achieved via user studies, surveys, and interactive sessions with qualitative data on user experiences. e) Human in the Loop Evaluation (HITL): Human in the Loop Evaluation extends user-centric assessment into a more sophisticated system-level framework. This approach is crucial for addressing the limitations of automated evaluation methods. HITL involves human evaluators who can provide subjective judgments and context-specific insights that auto- mated systems may miss. HITL enhances the relevance and re- liability of evaluations, ensuring that models are judged based on their actual utility rather than just theoretical benchmarks. Furthermore, the Arena Module concept addresses limitations inherent in static leaderboards by offering ongoing assessments that evolve with user interaction, providing a dynamic and realistic evaluation environment in actual usage contexts. f) Analytical Failure Exploration: Understanding the root causes of failures represents a deeper layer of sys- tem evaluation that moves beyond surface-level performance metrics. Analytical failure exploration involves identifying and analyzing the specific reasons why an LLM fails in certain tasks. This can be achieved through techniques such as error analysis, case studies, and post-hoc explanations. By pinpointing the underlying issues, researchers can develop targeted interventions to address these weaknesses. Addition- ally, sharing failure cases and their analyses can foster a SHELL et al.: A SAMPLE ARTICLE USING IEEETRAN.CLS FOR IEEE JOURNALS 17 collaborative environment where the community can learn from each other\u2019s experiences and collectively improve LLMs. This approach moves evaluation from merely identifying what fails to understanding why it fails, enabling more meaningful improvements in model design and deployment strategies. g) Dynamic Evaluation: It represents a critical shift from one-time assessment to continuous evaluation. Dynamic evaluation ensures that LLMs are assessed under realistic and up-to-date conditions, promoting continuous improvement and innovation. h) Superior Value-Oriented Evaluation: The highest tier of evaluation considerations would encompasses value- oriented dimensions that transcend technical performance to consider broader societal implications. Implementing a value- oriented evaluation framework requires a multi-faceted im- plementation, combining quantitative and qualitative analysis, data collection, expert reviews, and user feedback.",

Implementing a value- oriented evaluation framework requires a multi-faceted im- plementation, combining quantitative and qualitative analysis, data collection, expert reviews, and user feedback. This rep- resents the natural culmination of evaluation considerations, from technical assessment to societal impact. VII. CONCLUSIONS This survey repositions LLM evaluation beyond benchmark- centric approaches by introducing an anthropomorphic frame- work that bridges the critical gap between technical perfor- mance and real-world impact. We pioneer a holistic IQ-EQ- PQ-VQ taxonomy\u2014integrating General Intelligence, Align- ment Ability, Professional Expertise, and Value Quotient, that transcends fragmented metrics to capture what LLMs know, how they apply knowledge, why their outputs resonate with human values, and how they contribute to societal well- being. Critically, this taxonomy reflects the developmental trajectory of LLMs themselves, with IQ corresponding to pre- training knowledge acquisition, PQ emerging from supervised fine-tuning, and EQ cultivated through reinforcement learn- ing\u2014providing not just an evaluation framework but a diag- nostic lens for model development. The systematic analysis of over 200 benchmarks across six dimensions that reveals hidden interconnections and critical gaps, we present a modular eval- uation architecture with six interconnected components that provides practitioners with actionable guidance for end-to-end evaluation pipelines.

APPENDIX The following appendix provides supplementary information re- garding the evaluation of LLMs and highlights some of the most prominent LLMs currently available. It aims to offer a comprehensive overview of the methodologies used to assess these models and to showcase examples of leading models in the field. A. Evaluation Methodology 1) Metric-centered Evaluation: It focuses on quantifying the performance of LLMs (LLMs) using standardized metrics. Common metrics include BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore, each capturing different aspects of text quality and relevance. For example, BLEU measures the precision of n-grams in generated text compared to reference texts, while ROUGE focuses on recall, assessing how well the generated text captures key ideas from the reference. BERTScore, on the other hand, leverages contextual embeddings to evaluate semantic similarity, providing a more nuanced assessment of text quality. These metrics are essential for benchmarking and comparing LLMs across various tasks and datasets. 2) Human-centered Evaluation: Human-centered evaluation involves human judges assessing the quality, relevance, and natu- ralness of LLM-generated text. This approach complements metric- centered evaluation by capturing subjective aspects that automated metrics may miss. For example, humans can evaluate whether generated text is coherent, contextually relevant, and free from biases. Human evaluation can also involve tasks such as rating the faithfulness of generated text to the input context or assessing the overall quality of generated summaries. This method is particularly important for evaluating the practical utility of LLMs in real-world applications. 3) Model-Centric Evaluation: It focuses on the internal mech- anisms and capabilities of LLMs. This includes analyzing the model\u2019s architecture, training process, and the quality of its embeddings. For example, evaluating the alignment between the model\u2019s decision logic and human reasoning is",

For example, evaluating the alignment between the model\u2019s decision logic and human reasoning is crucial for ensuring that LLMs produce outputs that are not only correct but also interpretable. Techniques e.g. feature importance analysis and attention mechanisms can provide insights into the model\u2019s decision-making process, helping to identify potential biases or areas for improvement. B. Prominent LLMs Several prominent LLMs have emerged in recent years, each with unique capabilities and applications. For example, GPT-4 from OpenAI has demonstrated advanced capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. Other notable models include Meta\u2019s Llama series and Alibaba\u2019s Qwen series, which have been fine- tuned for various NLP tasks. These models are evaluated using a combination of intrinsic metrics (such as, perplexity, accuracy) and extrinsic metrics (such as, performance on specific tasks) to assess their overall effectiveness. The choice of LLM often depends on the specific application, with each model offering trade-offs in terms of performance, computational efficiency, and ease of use. Table X demonstrates list of prominent LLMs (published after 2022 and model parameters over 1B) and their basic information. TABLE X: List of Prominent LLMs and their basic informa- tion ( accurate as of August 20, 2025), includes representative models and does not encompass all available models.

    "USA 1.3 - C. Discussion: Critical Reflections on Evaluation Practices 1) The Disconnect Between Evaluation Benchmarks and Real-World Performance: A critical challenge in contemporary LLM evaluation lies in the growing misalignment between stan- dardized benchmarks and practical deployment requirements. While SHELL et al.: A SAMPLE ARTICLE USING IEEETRAN.CLS FOR IEEE JOURNALS 23 traditional evaluation methodologies provide valuable snapshots of model capabilities in controlled environments, they often fail to capture the nuanced interplay between model architecture, contextual adaptation, and real-world utility. This performance discrepancy re- veals a fundamental limitation in current evaluation paradigms\u2014their inability to adequately assess models in dynamic, interactive settings that better approximate production environments. The emergence of frameworks like Mint and WebArena represents a promising step toward addressing this gap by simulating realistic user interac- tions and environmental feedback loops, yet their adoption remains limited compared to traditional static benchmarks. This disconnect between laboratory evaluations and practical deployment outcomes has significant implications, as organizations increasingly rely on benchmark scores to make critical deployment decisions without fully understanding the limitations of these metrics in predicting real-world performance. 2) Fragmentation and Proliferation of Evaluation Bench- marks: The rapid proliferation of specialized evaluation benchmarks has created both opportunities and significant challenges for the research community. Analysis of numerous evaluation frameworks reveals substantial variation in model rankings across different bench- mark categories, complicating cross-model comparison and creating what we term \"evaluation overload.\" The situation is further exacer- bated by the resource-intensive nature of comprehensive evaluation, which effectively excludes many academic and independent research groups from meaningful participation in rigorous model assessment. The knowledge base reveals an overwhelming diversity of bench- marks targeting specific capabilities, each with its own methodology and scoring system, making it difficult to synthesize a coherent understanding of model capabilities across the evaluation spectrum. This fragmentation hinders the development of a unified evaluation standard that could facilitate more meaningful progress in the field. 3) Language-Specific and Cultural Dimensions in LLM Evaluation: Evaluating language models in non-English contexts presents unique methodological challenges that extend beyond mere translation of English-centric benchmarks. The intricate nature of linguistic features in languages such as Chinese\u2014including character- based semantics, tonal variations, and cultural context dependen- cies\u2014requires specialized assessment frameworks that account for these distinctive characteristics. Current evaluation practices often overlook critical aspects such as idiomatic expression comprehension, classical language references, and culturally appropriate response generation. The knowledge base references several Chinese-specific evaluation frameworks like Zhujiu, yet these remain insufficient to address the full spectrum of linguistic and cultural nuances. This limitation extends beyond Chinese to numerous other languages, highlighting the urgent need for culturally adaptive metrics that assess not only linguistic accuracy but also sociocultural appropriateness within specific language contexts. The current evaluation ecosystem remains",
    "yet these remain insufficient to address the full spectrum of linguistic and cultural nuances. This limitation extends beyond Chinese to numerous other languages, highlighting the urgent need for culturally adaptive metrics that assess not only linguistic accuracy but also sociocultural appropriateness within specific language contexts. The current evaluation ecosystem remains heavily biased toward English, with only a fraction of bench- marks addressing multilingual capabilities, thereby marginalizing the needs of the global majority of non-English language users. 4) Toward Integrated and Practical Evaluation Frame- works: Addressing the challenges outlined above requires the de- velopment of meta-evaluation frameworks that can synthesize results from multiple assessment dimensions while remaining accessible to resource-constrained researchers. Weighted aggregation approaches that prioritize benchmarks based on real-world task relevance rather than equal weighting offer a promising path forward, creating more meaningful composite scores that better predict practical model utility across diverse application scenarios. The knowledge base reveals several promising frameworks that could serve as building blocks for this integrated approach. An effective integrated evaluation framework should balance technical proficiency metrics (measured through standardized benchmarks), contextual adaptability (assessed via domain-specific tasks), and ethical robustness (evaluated through safety-oriented frameworks), creating a holistic assessment that better reflects real-world model performance."

    "RLMR: Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards for Creative Writing Jianxing Liao1*, Tian Zhang1, Xiao Feng1\u2020, Yusong Zhang1, Rui Yang1, Haorui Wang1*, Bosi Wen2*, Ziying Wang3*, Runzhi Shi3* 1Tencent Hunyuan Team 2Tsinghua University 3Peking University jianxliao@tencent.com, alicexfeng@tencent.com\u2020 Abstract Large language models are extensively utilized in creative writing applications. Creative writing requires a balance be- tween subjective writing quality (e.g., literariness and emo- tional expression) and objective constraint following (e.g., format requirements and word limits). Existing reinforcement learning methods struggle to balance these two aspects: sin- gle reward strategies fail to improve both abilities simulta- neously, while fixed-weight mixed-reward methods lack the ability to adapt to different writing scenarios. To address this problem, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards (RLMR), utilizing a dynamically mixed reward sys- tem from a writing reward model evaluating subjective writ- ing quality and a constraint verification model assessing ob- jective constraint following. The constraint following reward weight is adjusted dynamically according to the writing qual- ity within sampled groups, ensuring that samples violating constraints get negative advantage in GRPO and thus penal- ized during training, which is the key innovation of this pro- posed method. We conduct automated and manual evalua- tions across diverse model families from 8B to 72B param- eters. Additionally, we construct a real-world writing bench- mark named WriteEval for comprehensive evaluation. Re- sults illustrate that our method achieves consistent improve- ments in both instruction following (IFEval from 83.36% to 86.65%) and writing quality (72.75% win rate in manual ex- pert pairwise evaluations on WriteEval). To the best of our knowledge, RLMR is the first work to combine subjective preferences with objective verification in online RL training, providing an effective solution for multi-dimensional creative writing optimization. Introduction Large language models (LLMs) are widely applied to cre- ative writing tasks, from traditional poetry composition to modern fiction generation, and from literary scriptwriting to commercial copywriting, fulfilling diverse writing demands across domains and genres. To further enhance LLM perfor- mance in creative writing tasks, reinforcement learning tech- niques have been widely applied during the post-training phase. Through methods such as Group Relative Policy Op- timization (GRPO), researchers aim to guide models toward *Work done when these authors interned at Tencent. \u2020Corresponding author. generating higher-quality creative content through reward signals. However, existing reinforcement learning reward strate- gies suffer from fundamental limitations. The evaluation cri- teria for creative writing are inherently dual in nature: on one hand, they require assessing subjective writing quali- ties such as literariness, emotional expression, and original- ity; on the other hand, they necessitate verifying objective constraint following, including length constraints, format re- quirements, and specific writing styles.

    "they require assessing subjective writing quali- ties such as literariness, emotional expression, and original- ity; on the other hand, they necessitate verifying objective constraint following, including length constraints, format re- quirements, and specific writing styles. Different creative writing scenarios exhibit significant variations in their em- phasis on subjective versus objective evaluation. Current reward strategies face two major challenges. First, single reward strategies struggle to simultaneously optimize both subjective and objective dimensions. As illustrated in Figure 1, under single-signal strategies, reward models only score writing quality without reflecting constraint following. Second, existing multi-reward signal fusion strategies typ- ically employ fixed-weight summation. Such fixed-weight mechanisms fail to dynamically adjust weights based on ac- tual sample performance within groups, making them un- suitable for different writing scenarios. To address these issues, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards (RLMR), a dynamic mixed- reward framework for creative writing. By coupling a writ- ing reward model for evaluating subjective writing qual- ity with a constraint verification model for assessing objec- tive constraint following, we implement an adaptive mech- anism that dynamically allocates reward weights based on constraint following within sampled group responses. Un- like existing methods that use fixed-weight fusion, our core innovation lies in dynamically adjusting the constraint fol- lowing reward weight according to writing quality within sampled groups. This ensures that samples violating con- straints receive negative advantage values in GRPO calcula- tions, thereby being systematically penalized during policy gradient updates. To validate our method\u2019s effectiveness, we conducted training on various scales of Qwen and DeepSeek model families and performed both automated and manual evalua- tions on multiple creative writing and instruction-following benchmarks. RLMR shows substantial gains in both writing quality and constraint following compared to single-reward and linear weighting baseline methods.

These results effectively validate that our method resolves the trade-off between subjective and objec- tive evaluation criteria in creative writing optimization. Our key contributions include: 1. Identifying the inherent limitations of single reward sig- nals and fixed-weight mixing strategies in creative writ- ing tasks. 2. Proposing RLMR and developing a dynamic reward adjustment mechanism that ensures constraint-violating samples receive negative advantages during training, en- abling better balance between writing quality and con- straint following among multiple reward signals. 3. Demonstrating consistent improvements across diverse model families and scales through comprehensive auto- mated and manual evaluations, proving the effectiveness of our method. Related Work To further improve LLM performance and align it with hu- man preferences, reinforcement learning, especially RLHF, has become a mainstream optimization approach. Al- gorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Ouyang et al. 2022) and Group Relative Policy Opti- mization (GRPO) (Shao et al. 2024) are widely used to align LLM behavior with human preferences. PPO ensures training stability by limiting the extent of policy updates through clipped probability ratios, but requires separate value function training which increases computational over- head. GRPO optimizes policy gradients by estimating base- lines from sampled groups, avoiding the need for separate value function training while maintaining competitive per- formance. Given GRPO\u2019s computational efficiency and ef- fectiveness in creative writing scenarios, we choose it as our reinforcement learning framework. Mixed reward strategies have become increasingly important in reinforcement learning, integrating multi- dimensional reward signals to guide model training more comprehensively. Peng et al. (Peng et al. 2025a) proposed the Agentic Reward Modeling framework, which combines human preference rewards with verifiable correctness sig- nals (factuality and instruction following) to provide more reliable rewards for large language models. Jia et al. (Jia et al. 2025) introduced Writing-Zero, proposing a writing- principle-based pairwise Generative Reward Model (GRM) that leverages self-principled critique to transform subjec- tive assessments into reliable, verifiable rewards for cre- ative writing tasks. Wu et al. (Wu et al. 2025) developed LongWriter-Zero framework for ultra-long text generation, employing specialized reward models targeting length con- trol, writing quality, and structural formatting with a com- posite reward function that averages individual advantages to balance multiple reward dimensions.

(Wu et al. 2025) developed LongWriter-Zero framework for ultra-long text generation, employing specialized reward models targeting length con- trol, writing quality, and structural formatting with a com- posite reward function that averages individual advantages to balance multiple reward dimensions. However, these existing mixed reward approaches all rely on fixed-weight fusion mechanisms, which suffer from fun- damental limitations. First, fixed weights cannot adapt to varying constraint compliance patterns within different sam- ple groups. When most responses in a group violate con- straints, fixed-weight strategies still assign positive gradients to high-quality but constraint-violating samples, contradict- ing creative writing requirements. Second, the relative im- portance between subjective quality assessment and objec- tive constraint following cannot be accurately determined, 22> query Policy Model \ufeff o \u200b1 \ufeff o \u200b2 \ufeff o \u200b3 Writing RM \ufeff r \u200b = 1 8 \ufeff r \u200b = 2 8 \ufeff r \u200b = 3 3 Dynamic score adjustment Reference Model KL Group computation \ufeff \u03b4 = \u200b n\u2212k n\u22c5r \u200b+\u03b3\u22c5n\u2212 r \u200b max vio \u2211i=1 n i Validator \u274c \ufeff \u03b4 = 4 Final Reward Score Validator \u2705 \u274c \u2705 Validator \u2705 Validator \u2705 8 8-4=4 3 Figure 2: Overview of our Dynamic Mixed-Reward GRPO Framework. The policy model generates responses (o1, o2, o3) evaluated by both writing quality (Writing RM) and constraint compliance (Validator). In this example: n = 3 (total samples), rvio max = 8 (highest reward among violating samples), \u03b3 = 1 (minimum gap below the mean), k = 1 (number of violating samples), Pn i=1 ri = 19 (sum of original rewards). The framework calculates penalty \u03b4 = 4 and deducts it from violating samples (o2 : 8 \u21924). After adjustment around mean=5, only high-quality compliant samples (o1) receive positive gradients (green), while both low-quality samples (o3) and constraint-violating samples (o2) receive negative gradients (red). making weight assignment difficult. To address these issues, we propose a dynamic mixed-reward GRPO framework that adaptively adjusts penalty weights based on actual constraint compliance performance within each sampled group, ensur- ing constraint-violating samples consistently receive nega- tive advantages during training. This dynamic adjustment approach is better suited for creative writing tasks. RLMR Framework for Creative Writing To effectively combine subjective and objective reward sig- nals, we propose a mixed-reward GRPO framework. This framework integrates a writing reward model for evaluat- ing writing quality with a verification model for assessing instruction compliance. By adjusting reward scores based on verification results, we achieve improved instruction- following capability while maintaining writing quality. Reward Models Our RLMR framework employs two reward models: a writ- ing reward model that evaluates subjective writing quality and a constraint verification model that assesses objective compliance with task requirements.",
    "compliance. By adjusting reward scores based on verification results, we achieve improved instruction- following capability while maintaining writing quality. Reward Models Our RLMR framework employs two reward models: a writ- ing reward model that evaluates subjective writing quality and a constraint verification model that assesses objective compliance with task requirements. Writing Reward Model. The writing reward model rwrite evaluates the overall quality of creative writing outputs. We train this model on a large language model using human- annotated preference pairs (yw, yl) for creative writing prompts x. Following the Bradley-Terry preference model, we optimize: Lwrite = \u2212E(x,yw,yl)\u223cD [log \u03c3(rwrite(x, yw) \u2212rwrite(x, yl))] (1) where yw and yl denote preferred and non-preferred re- sponses, and \u03c3 is the sigmoid function. Unlike general re- ward models, our writing reward model captures creative writing features including literary expression, emotional depth, originality, narrative coherence, and stylistic maturity. Constraint Verification Model The verification model identifies constraint violations in creative writing tasks, in- cluding word limits, formatting requirements, and content restrictions. For query q and response o, the model outputs: V (o, q) = n ^ i=1 verify(o, ci) (2) where C = {c1, c2, ..., cn} represents n identified con- straints, and V denotes logical conjunction. A response is compliant only if all constraints are satisfied. Dynamic Reward Adjustment Strategy Fixed-weight reward fusion inadequately balances writing quality and constraint compliance. We introduce a dynamic adjustment mechanism that modifies original rewards be- fore computing GRPO advantages. This ensures constraint- violating samples receive systematic penalties while pre- serving GRPO\u2019s comparative structure. In standard GRPO, policy \u03c0\u03b8old generates G responses {o1, ..., oG} for query q with rewards {r1, ..., rG}. Advan- tages are computed as: \u02c6Ai = ri \u2212mean(r) std(r) (3) Our strategy ensures constraint-violating samples obtain negative advantages after normalization, acting as negative examples during optimization. Compliant samples receive positive advantages and are prioritized for learning. For each query, we sample n responses S = {s1, ..., sn} with original rewards {r1, ..., rn}. We first identify constraint-violating samples through the verification model and adjust their rewards accordingly: r\u2032 i = \u001ari if V (si, q) = True ri \u2212\u03b4 if V (si, q) = False (4) where \u03b4 > 0 is the penalty term to be determined. Let k denote the number of constraint-violating samples in the group. The adjusted mean becomes: \u00afr\u2032 = 1 n n X i=1 r\u2032 i = 1 n n X i=1 ri \u2212k\u03b4 ! (5) To guarantee that all constraint-violating samples receive negative advantages after normalization, we require that for any violating sample j where V (sj, q) = False: r\u2032 j < \u00afr\u2032 \u2212\u03b3 (6) where \u03b3 > 0 controls the minimum gap below the ad- justed mean.",
    "X i=1 ri \u2212k\u03b4 ! (5) To guarantee that all constraint-violating samples receive negative advantages after normalization, we require that for any violating sample j where V (sj, q) = False: r\u2032 j < \u00afr\u2032 \u2212\u03b3 (6) where \u03b3 > 0 controls the minimum gap below the ad- justed mean. This ensures violating samples will have suffi- ciently negative advantages to be suppressed during training. To determine the appropriate penalty \u03b4, let rvio max be the highest original reward among all constraint-violating sam- ples. Substituting Equations (4) and (5) into inequality (6), we derive the penalty bound: \u03b4 \u2265n \u00b7 rvio max + n \u00b7 \u03b3 \u2212Pn i=1 ri n \u2212k (7) Setting \u03b4 above this bound ensures all violating sam- ples produce negative advantages, systematically suppress- ing them during gradient updates while preserving the rel- ative ordering among compliant samples. This dynamic ad- justment mechanism allows the model to learn from high- quality compliant responses while avoiding the reinforce- ment of constraint violations. Dynamic Sampling Strategy Inspired by DAPO (Yu et al. 2025), we address gradient vanishing in creative writing RL training. When all sampled responses receive identi- cal scores, zero advantages yield zero gradients. In cre- ative tasks, this occurs with over-optimized samples, under- optimized samples, and samples where all responses violate constraints. We implement a composite filtering strategy that removes three types of ineffective samples: (1) groups where all re- wards exceed a high threshold, (2) groups where all rewards fall below a low threshold, and (3) groups where all re- sponses fail verification. When filtered samples are insuf- ficient, we dynamically resample new prompts to maintain adequate contrastive signals for effective training. Experiments and Results In this section, we show experiments to test our dynamic mixed-reward GRPO framework for creative writing. We de- scribe the setup, share results, and give analysis. Experimental Setup Training Query Construction We construct our GRPO training queries from real-world seed data, we apply the self-instruct (Wang et al. 2023) methodology to expand the dataset diversity while maintaining realistic writing scenar- ios. To ensure balanced genre representation, we employ DeepSeek-V3 to classify generated queries by writing genre and adjust the sampling distribution to match real-world pro- portions observed in our seed data. This process yields a fi- nal training set of 8,739 queries. Evaluation Benchmarks We test model performance on writing quality and instruction following using four bench- marks: WritingBench (Yao et al. 2025) covers 6 main categories and 100 subdomains like academic, finance, politics, lit- erature, education, and marketing.

We use Claude-4- Sonnet to score outputs. WriteEval is our custom dataset containing 890 sam- ples collected from real-world scenarios and augmented with LLM-generated instructions to match authentic writ- ing styles. The dataset uniformly covers 30 primary writing genres and 377 secondary categories, including Chinese-specific genres such as folk texts, classical Chi- nese, and composition writing. For each instruction, we solicited responses from six competitive Chinese writ- ing models: Claude-4-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-Pro, DeepSeek- R1, DeepSeek-V3, Doubao-1.5-Thinking, and Hunyuan- TurboS. Human experts conducted blind evaluation to se- lect the best response from each set as reference answers. For automated evaluation, Claude-4-Opus compares model outputs against reference answers to determine win rates: Win Rate = Number of wins Total comparisons \u00d7 100% where a \u201dwin\u201d indicates the model output is judged superior to the reference answer. Detailed prompt templates are provided in the appendix. ComplexBench (Wen et al. 2024) checks complex in- struction following with combined constraints. It builds hard prompts that need to meet multiple rules. Scoring uses ques- tions to check each part. IFEval (Zhou et al. 2023) is Google\u2019s benchmark for verifiable instructions like word count or keywords. It has 25 types across 500 prompts. We use prompt-level strict- accuracy for evaluation. Baseline Methods To evaluate our dynamic mixed-reward strategy, we compare against three baseline methods that represent the spectrum of existing reward strategies in cre- ative writing optimization: (1) Writing Reward Only GRPO: This baseline trains using only writing quality rewards without any constraint verification signals. This method represents the traditional approach in RLHF where models are optimized solely based on human preference signals for output quality (Ouyang et al. 2022; Stiennon et al. 2020). Following established RLHF practices, this baseline uses a reward model trained on human-annotated preference pairs to score creative writ- ing outputs (Dong et al. 2024).

This approach aligns with recent work on Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Re- wards (RLVR), where models are trained using determin- istic verification functions for tasks with clear correctness criteria (Cobbe et al. 2021; Mroueh 2025). TheBy com- paring against these methods, we demonstrate that our dy- namic mixed-reward strategy addresses the limitations of both single-reward and fixed-weight approaches, providing a more effective solution for creative writing optimization. (3) Linear Weighting Strategy: Following the approach proposed by Peng et al. (2025b), this baseline combines writing rewards with verification signals through fixed- weight linear combination. Specifically, we normalize both writing rewards and verification scores to the [0,1] range and compute their arithmetic mean: (snormalized writing + snormalized verification)/2. This method represents the current state-of-the-art in mixed-reward strategies, as demonstrated in the Agentic Reward Modeling framework (Peng et al. 2025b), which successfully integrates human preference re- wards with verifiable correctness signals including factuality and instruction following. Reward Model and Training Setup Writing Reward Model. We use a Pointwise Bradley- Terry Reward Model (Bradley and Terry 1952; Ouyang et al. 2022) for continuous feedback. It trains on Tencent- Hunyuan-Large (Sun et al. 2024) with 200,000 labeled sam- ples. Each sample has a prompt and two responses; humans pick the better one based on quality, adherence, style, and experience. We use this model for rewards in RLHF to match human preferences.

We employ binary verification (all constraints satisfied or not) rather than proportion-based scoring because partial constraint satisfaction is function- ally equivalent to complete failure in creative writing tasks. This binary approach ensures the model learns to generate responses that satisfy all constraints simultaneously, rather than trading off between different constraint types.

Experimental Results Automated Evaluation Results We test our framework on four models: Qwen2.5-32B and Qwen2.5-72B (Team 2024; Yang et al. 2024), Qwen3-8B (Yang et al. 2025), and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B (DeepSeek-AI 2025). Table ?? shows results across methods and benchmarks. The automated evaluation results reveal compelling ev- idence for the effectiveness of our dynamic mixed-reward approach. Results from Qwen2.5-32B clearly expose the inherent problems with single reward signals. When train- ing with writing RM alone, writing quality improves mod- estly from 6.14 to 6.35, yet instruction following suffers substantial degradation: ComplexBench performance drops from 74.78% to 68.42%, while IFEval accuracy falls from 83.36% to 80.41%. The reverse pattern emerges when using only the constraint verification model\u2014instruction follow- ing on ComplexBench rises from 74.78% to 83.94%, but writing quality plummets from 6.14 to 5.73, with WriteE- val performance collapsing from 3.93% to a mere 1.24%. This stark trade-off demonstrates that single signals cannot balance subjective creative quality with objective constraint adherence. Given these limitations, mixed-reward strategies emerge as a natural solution by combining writing RM with con- straint verification signals. The most classical approach is linear weighting, which averages the two reward types with fixed coefficients. On Qwen2.5-32B, this approach elevates writing quality to 7.13 while preserving reasonable instruc- tion following capabilities, successfully avoiding the severe bias problems observed with single-signal methods. These results underscore the critical importance of integrating both subjective and objective evaluation dimensions in creative writing optimization. However, our RLMR method delivers even greater im- provements, consistently outperforming linear weighting across all tested models. On Qwen2.5-32B, RLMR pushes writing quality further to 7.93 and achieves an 11.56% WriteEval win rate, substantially surpassing linear weight- ing\u2019s 7.13 and 6.40% respectively. This pattern of superior performance extends to other architectures: Qwen3-8B sees writing quality rise from 7.61 to 8.13, with WriteEval win rates jumping from 26.64% to 31.69%.

The robustness of these improvements becomes evident when examining results across diverse model scales. Our ex- periments span architectures ranging from 8B to 72B param- eters, including both Qwen and DeepSeek families, with all models demonstrating consistent advantages under RLMR. Manual Evaluation Results We conducted human evalu- ation on 200 randomly sampled instances from the WriteE- val dataset to assess model performance across three dimen- sions: Instruction Following, Content Quality, and Overall Performance. Detailed scoring criteria and guidelines are provided in the appendix. For Instruction Following, we consider a score of 4 as complete instruction adherence. For Content Quality and Overall Performance, scores of 3 or above are considered satisfactory. Figure 3 presents the score distribution across all three evaluation dimensions. The results clearly demonstrate the limitations of single-reward strategies. The writing-only baseline shows inferior performance across multiple dimen- sions compared to mixed-reward approaches, with notably lower satisfactory rates in instruction following and content quality. Among mixed-reward strategies, our RLMR method achieves higher satisfactory rates across all dimensions. Specifically, for Instruction Following, RLMR shows the highest proportion of perfect scores (score 4), indicating superior constraint adherence. In Content Quality, RLMR demonstrates a more favorable distribution with increased proportions in higher score ranges (scores 4-5), suggesting better content generation capabilities. The Overall Perfor- mance dimension reveals similar trends, with RLMR achiev- ing the most balanced distribution toward higher satisfaction levels. Figure 4 shows the results of direct pairwise comparisons for Overall Performance. RLMR achieves substantial win rates against both baseline methods: 45.5% win rate ver- sus writing-only baseline and 33.5% win rate versus lin- ear weighting strategy. These results demonstrate that our RLMR strategy achieves higher usability and satisfaction rates in creative writing tasks, confirming the practical ef- fectiveness of our approach. | win tie Mm lose Linear Weighting Strategy only Writing RM only Writing RM Linear Weighting Strategy 40 60 80 100 Overall Performance (a) Writing Reward Scores (b) IFEval Performance (c) Response Length Figure 5: Training dynamics across different metrics.

    "experimental results demonstrate that single reward sig- nals fail to balance writing quality and instruction follow- ing effectively. Using only writing rewards improves cre- ative quality but reduces constraint adherence. Using only verification signals severely harms writing quality while pro- viding limited gains in instruction following. These findings confirm that creative writing optimization requires careful integration of both subjective and objective evaluation crite- ria. Our dynamic mixed-reward strategy significantly outper- forms linear weighting approaches across all tested models and benchmarks. This superiority stems from fundamental limitations of fixed-weight methods. Writing quality scores and constraint verification signals operate on different scales and distributions. Writing rewards typically follow continu- ous distributions, while constraint verification produces bi- nary outcomes. The scalar inconsistency between these two signals makes it difficult to determine appropriate weight- ing coefficients. Moreover, optimal weighting coefficients need adjustment for different reward models, making fixed- weight approaches impractical across diverse model config- urations. Our dynamic adjustment mechanism addresses these limitations by calculating penalty terms based on actual constraint compliance patterns within each sample group. Rather than applying uniform weights, the approach mod- ulates penalties according to the theoretical bounds derived in Equation (7). This ensures constraint-violating samples consistently receive negative advantages and are suppressed during training. Figure 5 shows training dynamics across key metrics. The writing RM only baseline achieves the highest writ- ing reward scores during training (Figure 5a), but this im- provement reveals classic reward hacking behavior. Despite high reward scores, its IFEval performance deteriorates sig- nificantly (Figure 5b), dropping below both the original model and other baselines. This divergence between reward scores and actual instruction-following capability demon- strates that the model learns to exploit the reward model rather than genuinely improving writing quality. The reward hacking behavior is further evidenced by the dramatic increase in response length (Figure 5c). The writ- ing RM only baseline shows uncontrolled length growth, reaching over 1400 tokens on average, which explains its poor instruction-following performance. When models gen- erate excessively long outputs, they cannot properly adhere to specific constraints like word count limits, format require- ments, or conciseness instructions. In contrast, our RLMR method maintains balanced opti- mization across all metrics. It achieves steady improvement in writing reward scores while preserving strong IFEval per- formance, demonstrating that our dynamic reward adjust- ment successfully prevents the model from exploiting ei- ther reward signal. The controlled response length further confirms that RLMR learns to generate high-quality content without resorting to length inflation.

This balanced training dynamic validates the effectiveness of our dynamic penalty mechanism in creating models that excel at both creative quality and constraint adherence. Conclusion we proposed RLMR (Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards), a dynamic mixed-reward GRPO framework that addresses the fundamental challenge of balancing subjective creative quality with objective constraint adherence in cre- ative writing optimization. By developing a dynamic reward adjustment mechanism that ensures constraint-violating samples receive negative advantages during training, our method overcomes the limitations of both single-reward and fixed-weight strategies. Experimental results across di- verse model architectures demonstrate that RLMR achieves substantial improvements in both writing quality (11.56% WriteEval win rate on Qwen2.5-32B) and constraint com- pliance (86.65% IFEval accuracy), with human evaluation confirming significant user preference. The training dynam- ics analysis reveals that our method successfully prevents reward hacking while maintaining stable optimization, pro- viding a principled and computationally efficient solution to multi-objective creative writing optimization. Future work includes extending this framework to other multi-signal sce- narios such as dialogue systems and code generation.

Appendix Manual Evaluation Criteria This section describes the evaluation criteria used to assess AI-generated responses in our human evaluation study. Our evaluation uses three distinct dimensions to capture different aspects of response quality: Instruction Follow- ing, Content Quality, and Overall Performance. Each di- mension focuses on specific characteristics that together pro- vide comprehensive coverage of response effectiveness.The scoring criteria are shown in Table 2. Instruction Follow- ing (1-4 scale) measures how accurately the response fol- lows the given instructions and meets specified require- ments. This dimension focuses on: \u2022 Understanding of user intent and task requirements \u2022 Compliance with format specifications (word count, structure, style) \u2022 Adherence to content constraints and guidelines \u2022 Completion of all requested elements Content Quality (1-5 scale) evaluates the intrinsic qual- ity of the generated content itself. This dimension assesses: \u2022 Factual accuracy and information reliability \u2022 Logical flow and coherence of ideas \u2022 Depth and thoroughness of content coverage \u2022 Appropriateness and relevance to the topic Overall Performance (1-5 scale) provides a holistic as- sessment of the response\u2019s practical value and user satisfac- tion. This dimension considers: \u2022 Practical utility for the intended purpose \u2022 Amount of editing or revision needed \u2022 Overall effectiveness in meeting user expectations \u2022 Integration of instruction following and content quality The key distinction between these dimensions is their fo- cus: Instruction Following emphasizes compliance and ad- herence, Content Quality focuses on the substance and reli- ability of information, while Overall Performance captures the integrated user experience. A response may score differ- ently across dimensions\u2014for example, perfectly following instructions (high Instruction Following) while containing shallow content (lower Content Quality). Annotators were trained to evaluate each dimension in- dependently while considering the specific requirements of creative writing tasks.

    "each dimension in- dependently while considering the specific requirements of creative writing tasks. WriteEval Dataset Information WriteEval is a comprehensive Chinese creative writing eval- uation dataset containing 890 samples collected from real- world scenarios. The dataset covers diverse writing genres and tasks, Each sample includes a writing prompt with spe- cific requirements and reference answers selected by human experts from multiple competitive models. The dataset construction process involved collecting seed data from authentic writing platforms and augmenting it us- ing self-instruct methodology to maintain realistic writing scenarios. To ensure balanced representation, we employed Figure 6: distribution of samples across major genre cate- gories DeepSeek-V3 to classify samples by genre and adjusted the distribution to match real-world writing task frequencies. The final dataset reflects the actual distribution of creative writing demands encountered in practice. WriteEval uniformly covers 30 primary writing genres with a total of 377 secondary categories. The dataset in- cludes Chinese-specific genres such as folk texts, classical Chinese, and composition writing alongside universal cate- gories. Table 3 shows the distribution of samples across ma- jor genre categories.Table 4 show some prompts of WriteE- val dataset. Case Study We present case studies to show how different reward strate- gies work in practice. These examples help us understand why RLMR performs better than existing methods in real writing tasks. Medical Thank-You Letter Reply We examine a task where a doctor needs to reply to a patient\u2019s thank-you letter. The task has specific requirements: (1) include salutation, greeting, body, closing wishes, signature, and date; (2) start the body with \u201dThank you very much for your letter, I feel very honored\u201d; (3) end the body with \u201dThank you again for your recognition and encouragement of my work. Wish you good health and a happy life!\u201d. As shown in Figure 7, the three methods produce different results: Writing Reward Only Strategy (3 points): This ap- proach creates rich and emotionally engaging content with professional warmth. However, it fails to include the re- quired opening phrase \u201dThank you very much for your letter, I feel very honored\u201d, using a generic greeting instead. While the content quality is high, the constraint violation signifi- cantly reduces its practical usability. Linear Weighting Strategy (2 points): This method cor- rectly includes both required opening and closing phrases, showing better instruction following. However, the con- tent between these constraints is overly formulaic and lacks Table 2: Response Quality Scoring Rubric Score Instruction Following Content Quality Overall Performance 1 Complete misunderstanding of user intent.

It successfully incorporates both required phrases while maintaining natural, engaging content throughout. The response demonstrates professional expertise and emo- tional warmth, with smooth content flow that doesn\u2019t feel constrained by the requirements. CEO Message for Operations Handbook We analyze another task where a CEO needs to write a concise message for an operations handbook. The task requires focusing on motivating employees, guiding business learning, overcom- ing difficulties, and promoting enterprise development, with emphasis on being concise. Figure 8 presents the outputs from the three approaches: Writing Reward Only Strategy (2 points): This method produces extremely lengthy content that violates the \u201dcon- cise\u201d requirement. While the content is rich and emotion- ally engaging, it far exceeds the specified length constraints, making it impractical for actual use. The verbose style un- dermines the effectiveness of the message. Linear Weighting Strategy (3 points): This approach achieves better length control but shows content focus de- viation. The motivational elements, which should be central to a CEO message, receive insufficient emphasis.

Incompleteness or truncation is the most serious error, therefore if the [Assistant]'s answer is incomplete, it must be judged as incorrect. [System] You are an answer quality assessment expert. Please check whether the [Assistant]'s answer satisfies all requirements in the [Question/Context] by following these steps: 1. First analyze what specific requirements are in the [Question/Context] 2. Determine whether the [Assistant]'s answer meets all requirements in the [Question/Context]. Note: If the [Question/Context] includes requirements regarding word count, length, frequency, etc., judge as follows: 2.1 If the result in [Assistant's Answer Word Count/Length/Frequency Check] is NULL, please ignore this result and make your own judgment 2.2 If the result in [Assistant's Answer Word Count/Length/Frequency Check] is not NULL, please base your judgment entirely on this result 3. According to the [Evaluation Criteria], judge whether the [Assistant]'s answer is correct. 4. Please first provide your analysis process, then give your conclusion in the format: \"- Conclusion: Correct/Incorrect\". [Additional Requirements] After outputting your assessment above, please organize your check into jsonlist format, with each constraint corresponding to an item. Each JSON object should include: 1. 'idx': Sequence number 2. 'constraint_str': Constraint content, such as \"Write a script for a modern history video group assignment.\" or \"The composition must have more than 600 words\" 3. 'constraint_judge_str': Reasons why",
    "your check into jsonlist format, with each constraint corresponding to an item. Each JSON object should include: 1. 'idx': Sequence number 2. 'constraint_str': Constraint content, such as \"Write a script for a modern history video group assignment.\" or \"The composition must have more than 600 words\" 3. 'constraint_judge_str': Reasons why the assistant's answer does/doesn't comply with this constraint. 4. 'constraint_judge': Judgment on whether the assistant's answer complies with this constraint, value being True/False 5. 'is_digital': Constraint type. You only need to determine whether the constraint includes numbers, such as requiring xx words, appearing xx times, writing several sentences/items/articles, requiring x-character words, etc. Any constraint involving numerical judgment must be classified as a numerical constraint. If judged as a numerical constraint, the value is True, otherwise False. 6. 'core_constraint': Whether this constraint is a core constraint, value being True/False. Notes: 1. Definition of core constraint (core_constraint): The most central task in the user's instruction (generally one and only one). For example: a request to write an 800-word essay beginning with \"My mother.\" Here there are three constraints: writing an essay, 800-word requirement, beginning with \"My mother\". Among these, \"writing an essay\" is the core constraint. 2. When judging is_digital, be sure not to miss constraints requiring x-character words, such as: \"come up with some three-character sword names\" is a numerical constraint. Additionally, when dealing with quantity issues related to common knowledge (e.g., idioms must be four characters), these should also be judged as numerical constraints.
