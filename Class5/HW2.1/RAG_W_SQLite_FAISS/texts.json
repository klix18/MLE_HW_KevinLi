Process reward models address this by providing\nstep-by-step feedback, but current approaches have two major drawbacks: they\ntypically function as classifiers without providing explanations, and their reliance\non supervised fine-tuning with static datasets limits generalization. Inspired by\nrecent advances, we reframe stepwise reward modeling from a classification task\nto a reasoning task itself. We thus propose a generative judge that reasons about\nthe policy model\u2019s reasoning steps (i.e., meta-reasons), outputting thinking tokens\nbefore delivering a final verdict. Our model, STEPWISER, is trained by reinforce-\nment learning using relative outcomes of rollouts. We show it provides (i) better\njudgment accuracy on intermediate steps than existing methods; (ii) can be used to\nimprove the policy model at training time; and (iii) improves inference-time search.\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nAs large language models (LLMs) increasingly tackle complex problems, they rely on multi-step\nreasoning strategies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) and ReAct (Yao et al., 2022) to\ndecompose tasks and formulate better solutions. Consequently, ensuring these intermediate reasoning\nsteps possess logical validity has become a critical research challenge. Process Reward Models\n(PRMs) have emerged as a potential tool to meet this need, providing step-by-step feedback for\nsupervising learning, instead of relying on a single, often sparse, outcome-based reward (Lightman\net al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023). However, this approach suffers from two major drawbacks. First,\ncurrent PRMs typically function as \u201cblack-box\u201d classifiers, providing a score or label without\nexplaining why a step is correct or flawed. Second, their reliance on supervised fine-tuning (SFT)\nwith static datasets can limit their ability to generalize to new reasoning patterns (Lightman et al.,\n2023; Luo et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023; Xiong et al., 2024b; Zhang et al., 2024a). In contrast,\nreasoning models themselves are trained to produce CoTs with reinforcement learning (RL) for best\nperformance (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025).\nIn this paper we propose to reward intermediate reasoning steps by first reasoning about those\nreasoning steps, before making a judgment \u2013 a meta-reasoning process which itself is trained by\nRL. Our overall method (as shown in Figure 1) to build such a stepwise generative judge involves 3\ncomponents: (1) a new self-segmentation technique to equip the base policy model with the ability to\nproduce coherent and informative reasoning chunks (chunks-of-thought); (2) assignment of target\nrewards to chunks via relative outcomes of rollouts; and (3) online training of judgment reasoning\nchains (i.e., reasoning about reasoning) and final reward judgments via RL. Our stepwise judge,\ntermed STEPWISER, can then be used to provide rewards either at training time or inference time in\norder to improve the reasoning ability of the policy model.\nWe conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our method across three key dimensions: (i) the judge\u2019s\nclassification accuracy on intermediate steps, e.g., via its score on ProcessBench (Zheng et al., 2024);\n(ii) its performance in a new inference-time search paradigm where the judge cleans up the reasoning\nhistory and re-samples \u2013 a method we propose for efficiently scaling sequential computation while\nmaintaining the original generation length; and (iii) its utility in data selection for downstream model\ntraining. Our experiments demonstrate that our RL-trained generative stepwise judge significantly\n1\narXiv:2508.19229v1  [cs.AI]  26 Aug 2025\n\nMonte-Carlo rollouts to \nestimate success rates after \neach chunk\nFinal successes\n0\n1\n0\n\u2026\n\u215c success\nBefore:\n\u215c success\nAfter:\n\u215e success\nCurrent \nchunk\nJudge\nSplit CoT \nthinking into \ncoherent chunks\nLabel chunks by \ncomparing before and \nafter success rates \nJudge CoT\n+\ndecision \n(good/bad)\nThought \nchunks\nResponse\nQuestion\nCurrent \nchunk\nQuestion\nPrevious \nchunks\nRL training reward\nup \u2192 good\ndown \u2192 bad   \nUse the labels to RL train a \nstepwise judge that evaluates \neach chunk using CoT\nIf success is:\nFigure 1: Overview of our STEPWISER training method: we teach the model to segment its\nchain-of-thought (CoT) into coherent chunks.

Lightman\net al. (2023) first demonstrated that a process-supervised model can significantly outperform an\noutcome-supervised one in guiding best-of-n sampling. However, their PRM800K dataset relied on\nintensive human annotation for each reasoning step, which is generally infeasible for larger, more\ndiverse and challenging datasets.\nSubsequent research has focused on automating this annotation process. Wang et al. (2023) proposed\nusing Monte Carlo (MC) rollouts to estimate the Q-value of each step, while Luo et al. (2024)\nintroduces a binary search method to efficiently identify faulty steps. Our work builds upon the\nMC-based annotation approach, exploring various methods for converting these Q-value estimates\ninto effective learning signals.\nIn parallel, another line of work has established a theoretical connection between intermediate step\nvalues and the final outcome within the framework of KL-regularized Markov Decision Processes\n(Zhong et al., 2024; Rafailov et al., 2024). This result has been used to derive DPO-like objectives for\nlearning an implicit PRM from outcome-only data (Xiong et al., 2024a; Cui et al., 2025; Zhou et al.,\n2025) or a KL-regularized version of the MC-based estimator (Zhang et al., 2024a). A recent work\n(Zha et al., 2025) prompts LLMs to evaluate each individual step before producing a final judgment,\nbut supervises only the evaluation of the final answer. These methods share the goal of learning a\nstepwise judge from sparse signals. The major advantage of this line of work is that it is easy to train\nthe judge in an online manner. A central question, which our work addresses, is whether the rich,\nexplicit signals from extensive Monte Carlo sampling provide a more effective learning signals for\nRL-based reward training.\nConcurrent work by He et al. (2025) uses a prompting approach to segment thought process into\ncoherent chunks similar to ours. However, their stepwise judge is based only on prompting techniques\n2\n\nthat leverages hints in CoT like \u201dWait, I made a mistake\u201d. In contrast, our method focuses on training\na judge using stepwise labels grounded in final verified answers.\n2.2\nJUDGE ARCHITECTURES\nThe process rewards described above can be used to train judges with different distinct architectures\nand training paradigms.\nDiscriminative PRMs\nThe most straightforward approach is to treat the task as a classification\nproblem. This involves replacing the language model\u2019s final layer with a linear head and fine-tuning\nit to predict a binary label for each step using a cross-entropy loss (Lightman et al., 2023). A\nmore recent method formulates the task as next-token prediction, prompting the LLM to generate a\npre-defined token (e.g., + or -) as its judgment (Wang et al., 2023; Xiong et al., 2024b). This approach\nfurther dates back to preference reward model training (Dong et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). Although\nthis method uses a generative mechanism, its function remains purely discriminative, as it outputs a\nsimple judgment without justification. We therefore group both under the discriminative category.\nGenerative judges with CoT reasoning\nIn sharp contrast, the second and most recent paradigm\nis the generative reasoning judge. Here, the evaluation itself is framed as a reasoning task. The\njudge first generates an explicit CoT to explain its rationale before outputting its final judgment.\nThis approach was initially explored for preference learning and ORMs (Zhang et al., 2024b; Chen\net al., 2025). There are also a few very recent works studying this paradigm shift in the context of\nstepwise judges, including Zhao et al. (2025); Zha et al. (2025); Khalifa et al. (2025). Though we\nshare similar spirit of leveraging the inherent reasoning ability of the LLMs to train a stepwise judge,\nthe algorithmic designs are distinctly different.\nIn contrast to Zhao et al. (2025) and Khalifa et al. (2025), who focus on offline rejection sampling\nfine-tuning, our investigation shows that such static training methods suffer from scalability issues,\nwhere the performance quickly stagnates after the initial few steps. In contrast, we cast the stepwise\njudgment as a reasoning task, and focus on online RL training. Zha et al. (2025) do use RL, but with\nsparse, trajectory-level supervision. Specifically, they prompt the LLMs to evaluate each individual\nstep and final answer but only the final verification is supervised. Their approach assumes that to get\nan accurate evaluation of the final answer, models implicitly become an stepwise judge. In contrast,\nour framework is built on dense, stepwise supervision via rollouts. Our experiments will show that\nthis explicit, online, stepwise signal is critical for training state-of-the-art generative judges.\n3\nMETHOD: TRAINING STEPWISE GENERATIVE JUDGES WITH RL\nAs depicted in Figure 1, our overall method STEPWISER consists of three components:\n\u2022 We equip the base policy model with the ability to self-segment Chain-of-Thoughts into\ncoherent and informative reasoning chunks, called Chunks-of-Thought. This is done by\ncreating SFT data with informative segments, so that the model can be trained to self-\nsegment. We show that this causes no loss in performance for the base model.\n\u2022 Given the chunks generated by the policy model, we annotate each chunk to create training\ndata for our generative stepwise judge with binary target labels. This is done by comparing\noutcomes of rollouts starting before and after the given chunk using the outcome rewards.\n\u2022 We perform online RL training using GRPO which trains our stepwise judge model to\nproduce judgment reasoning chains (i.e., reasoning about reasoning) and reward final\njudgments that match the chunk labels from the previous step.\nWe describe the three components in detail in the following three subsections.\n3.1\nCOT GENERATION WITH SELF-SEGMENTATION (CHUNKS-OF-THOUGHT)\nTo train judges that can evaluate individual steps in a reasoning process, a key challenge is defining\nwhat a \u201cstep\u201d is. While CoT reasoning enables models to reason step by step, properly segmenting\nthis reasoning remains a difficult problem.\n3\n\nTable 1: Rules that we provide for an LLM to create segmented Chunks-of-Thought SFT data.\nRules for CoT Trajectory Segmentation\nSegmentation Principles\n1. Unified purpose: A chunk should serve a single, clear objective. For example: setting up an\ninitial equation, executing a self-contained calculation (like integration by parts), or stating a\nfinal/intermediate conclusion. All content within the chunk must directly serve this one core goal.\n2. Logical Cohesion: All lines within a chunk must form a continuous and uninterrupted logical flow.\nA new chunk should begin as soon as the focus or purpose of the reasoning shifts.\n3. Clear Transition: A new chunk must begin when the problem-solving process enters a new phase.\nThis includes transitioning from \u201dsolving for a variable\u201d to \u201dverifying the answer,\u201d or inserting an\n\u201dexplanatory side-note\u201d into the main workflow.\nFormat rules.\n1. Use <chunk>... </chunk> to mark the beginning and end of each segment. The text and\nnewlines inside the tags must not be altered.\n2. The final output should only contain the tagged content, without any additional text, titles, or blank\nlines.\n3. You must preserve all original text and newlines exactly as they appear within the tags.\nCurrent methods often segment reasoning trajectories using pre-defined tokens, like \u201cStep 1, Step\n2\u201d or simply using double line breaks as delimiters. However, these heuristics frequently result in\nsegments that are neither logically complete nor self-contained. Each segment contains only limited\ninformation, making it unsuitable as a standalone unit for a judge model to evaluate effectively. We\npresent a representative example in Table 2, where the model tends to insert double line breaks\nbefore and after a mathematical equation. This breaks an intuitively unified logical step into three\ndifferent chunks, where one chunk contains a textual explanation, and the next with the corresponding\nequation.\nAchieving better step definition via self-segmentation.\nTo mitigate this issue, we propose a\nmethod to teach the model to generate and simultaneously self-segment its own reasoning chains into\nmore meaningful steps. First, we define the criteria for a high-quality reasoning step. The core idea is\nthat each step should represent a complete logical leap or a self-contained part of the problem-solving\nprocess. Our definitions are given in Table 1. We then We then create our training data by:\n1. Generating a set of initial reasoning trajectories from the base model.\n2. Using an LLM prompted with our rules, to automatically segment these trajectories into\nlogically coherent steps.\n3.2\nSTEPWISE DATA ANNOTATION\nStepwise data annotation via Q value estimation.\nPrevious work has used human labelers to\nannotate correctness of each reasoning step (Lightman et al., 2023), although most such data is\ncollected for proprietary models that we cannot access. Other works annotate steps automatically\nusing methods like Monte Carlo estimation (Wang et al., 2023). We follow this second approach,\nusing an estimated Q-value to measure the quality of each step.\nFor a given training prompt x with verifiable outcome rewards, we generate a response from our\npolicy model \u03c0 which segments its CoT into chunks a = [a1, a2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , aH], where ai is the i-th\nreasoning chunk. Then, the Q value of an individual step ai and its history is the expected final\nreward starting from that point:\nQ\u03c0\u0000[x, a1:i\u22121], ai\n\u0001\n:= Q\u03c0(si\u22121, ai) = Eai+1:H\u223c\u03c0(\u00b7|x,a1:i)r\u22c6(x, a1:H),\n(1)\nwhere si := [x, a1:i\u22121] is the history, and r\u22c6is a final reward, which can be 1 for correct answers and\n0 otherwise. We estimate this Q-value by generating M full completions aj\ni+1:H from that step ai\n4\n\nTable 2: A representative example illustrating CoT segmentation methods based on a response\nfrom Qwen2.5-1.5B-it. Standard splitting by newlines (left) results in too many chunks, often\nseparating textual explanations from their corresponding mathematical equations. In contrast, our\nself-segmentation approach (right) yields more coherent and meaningful chunks, with a clear, self-\ncontained purpose\u2014simplifying the second term in the previously established equation (note that the\nsummary of this goal is for illustration and not generated by the model). Additional full examples are\nprovided in the appendix.\nSplit by \\n\\n\nLLM-based self-segmentation (Chunks-of-Thought)\n...\nchunk 8\nq\n(x2 \u2212y2 + 1 + x + y)2 + (2xy + x + y)2.\nchunk 9\nSimilarly, for the second term, we have:\nchunk 10\n\f\f\f\f\f\nz2 + 4i \u22123\nz \u2212i + 2\n\f\f\f\f\f =\n\f\f\f\f\f\n(x + yi)2 + 4i \u22123\nx + yi \u2212i + 2\n\f\f\f\f\f .\nchunk 11\nSince z2 + 4i \u22123 = x2 \u2212y2 + 2xyi + 4i \u22123 = (x2 \u2212y2 \u2212\n3) + (2xy + 4)i, we get:\nchunk 12\nz \u2212i + 2 = x + (y \u22121) = x + yi \u2212i + 2 = (x + 2) + yi.\nchunk 13\nUsing the same logic as above, the magnitude is:\n...\nchunk 3 (Simplify the Second Term and Formulate Equations)\nSimilarly, for the second term, we have:\n\f\f\f\f\f\nz2 + 4i \u22123\nz \u2212i + 2\n\f\f\f\f\f =\n\f\f\f\f\f\n(x + yi)2 + 4i \u22123\nx + yi \u2212i + 2\n\f\f\f\f\f .\nSince z2 + 4i \u22123 = x2 \u2212y2 + 2xyi + 4i \u22123 = (x2 \u2212y2 \u2212\n3) + (2xy + 4)i, we get:\nz \u2212i + 2 = x + (y \u22121) = x + yi \u2212i + 2 = (x + 2) + yi.\nUsing the same logic as above, the magnitude is:\nq\u0000x2 \u2212y2 \u22123 + x + y + 2\n\u00012 + (2xy + 4 + x + y)2\n=\nq\u0000x2 \u2212y2 \u22121 + x + y\n\u00012 + (2xy + x + y + 4)2.\nand calculating the average final reward, i.e. the ratio of correct final answers:\nbQ\u03c0\u0000si\u22121, ai\n\u0001\n= 1\nM\nM\nX\nj=1\nr\u22c6(x, a1:i, aj\ni+1:H).\n(2)\nFollowing prior work (Wang et al., 2023; Xiong et al., 2024b), we can then assign a binary label to\nthe step based on this Q-value:\nyi =\n(\n+\nif bQ\u03c0\u0000si\u22121, ai\n\u0001\n> 0,\n\u2212\nif bQ\u03c0\u0000si\u22121, ai\n\u0001\n= 0.\nFor convenience, we refer to this labeling approach as Absolute Q value thresholding (Abs-Q).\nRewarding the progress.\nOne drawback of Abs-Q is its insensitivity to the dynamics of the\nreasoning process. For instance, it does not differentiate between a step that raises the success\nprobability from 10% to 50% and one that drops it from 60% to 55%. To reward progress, we also\nexplore methods that consider the change in Q-value.\nSetlur et al. (2024) proposes to consider the change in value. Specifically, they define the notion of\neffective reward as a combination of Q value and advantage function of the best-of-n policy induced\nby r\u22c6:\nQ\u03c0(si\u22121, ai) + \u03b1 \u00b7 A\u00b5(si\u22121, ai),\n(3)\nwhere \u03b1 > 0 is a hyperparameter, and A\u00b5(si\u22121, ai) := Q\u00b5(si\u22121, ai) \u2212Q\u00b5(si\u22122, ai\u22121). Here \u00b5 is\ntaken as the best-of-n policy with r\u22c6. In other words, we generate n responses from \u03c0 and use r\u22c6to\nselect the best one. In this case, \u00b5 satisfies that Q\u00b5(si\u22121, ai) = 1 \u2212(1 \u2212Q\u03c0(si\u22121, ai))n. Therefore,\nthe effective reward can also be estimated via Q value estimation. Accordingly, we consider an\nalternative approach of data annotation:\nyi =\n(\n+\nif bQ\u03c0\u0000si\u22121, ai\n\u0001\n+ \u03b1 \u00b7 bA\u00b5\u0000si\u22121, ai\n\u0001\n> 0,\n\u2212\nif bQ\u03c0\u0000si\u22121, ai\n\u0001\n+ \u03b1 \u00b7 bA\u00b5\u0000si\u22121, ai\n\u0001\n= 0.\n5\n\nWe refer to this labeling approach as Relative Effective Reward Thresholding (Rel-Effective).\nAs a simpler alternative to capture relative improvement, we also consider a method based on the\nvalue ratio, where the label is determined as:\nyi =\n(\n+\nif bQ\u03c0\u0000si\u22121, ai\n\u0001\n/ bQ\u03c0\u0000si\u22122, ai\u22121\n\u0001\n> \u03b3,\n\u2212\nif bQ\u03c0\u0000si\u22121, ai\n\u0001\n/ bQ\u03c0\u0000si\u22122, ai\u22121\n\u0001\n\u2264\u03b3.\nHere \u03b3 > 0 is a threshold and we refer this labeling approach as Rel-Ratio.\nUsing one of these methods, we can assign binary label yi to every step ai in a reasoning trajectory.\nSince these labels come from unbiased estimates of the actual Q-values, they are likely to be more\nreliable compared to more ad-hoc methods. For example, if a step ai is the first step with a mistake,\nrollouts starting after ai are more likely to fail compared to ones that start before the flawed step ai.\n3.3\nTRAINING THE JUDGE VIA RL\nAt this stage we now have the recipe to create segmented (chunked) reasoning chains, each with a\nstepwise target label, across our training data. A straightforward approach would be to train a judge\nmodel as a classifier using standard SFT, as done in prior works (Wang et al., 2023; Xiong et al.,\n2024b). However, recent studies suggest that a more robust and effective judge can be created by\nhaving it generate its own CoT analysis to evaluate the models\u2019 responses (Zhang et al., 2024b; Chen\net al., 2025; Whitehouse et al., 2025). In the meantime, this generative formulation naturally allows\nus to train the judge via reinforcement learning. We therefore frame the stepwise evaluation as a\nreasoning task where the judge model first generates an analytical rationale and then concludes with\na final judgment. This approach is compelling also because it forces the judge to \u201cshow its work\u201d,\nproviding a more transparent and potentially more accurate evaluation process.\nTask formulation and prompt dataset balancing.\nWe decompose the full trajectories into step-\nlevel training prompts. For each training prompt, the model is provided with the original problem x,\nthe reasoning history a1:i\u22121, and the new reasoning chunk ai to be evaluated. The model is prompted\nto generate its own Cot reasoning about the correctness of the step ai, followed by a final judgment\nin a predefined format (e.g., enclosed in a box). Such CoT reasoning in the judge allows it to spend\nmore compute and perform thorough analysis of a reasoning step ai, which is likely necessary given\nai itself is a part of CoT that performs non-trivial reasoning. See Table 3 for the prompt template\nused.\nA critical but often overlooked aspect of the stepwise judge training is that the stepwise labels can be\nhighly imbalanced due to the data annotation process in Section 3.2. For example, with the Qwen2.5-\n1.5B-chunk model, 70.2% of Abs-Q samples are labeled as correct. In our early experiments, we\nobserve that these imbalanced prompt set can cause model degeneration, as the model can achieve a\nhigh score by simply predicting \u201ccorrect\u201d in most cases. To mitigate this, we make prompt dataset\nbalancing an explicit part of our method: we down-sample the majority class so that the numbers\nof positive and negative prompts are equal. We find this balancing step to be essential for stable RL\ntraining, as it ensures the reward signal reflects the model\u2019s discriminative ability rather than class\nfrequency bias. We will study its impacts on the final model performance in Section 4.3.\nReward and RL training.\nThe training signal for RL is direct and intuitive. For each step ai, the\njudge model receives a reward of 1 if its judgment aligns with the label yi (created by Monte-Carlo\nestimations), and 0 otherwise. We use GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) as our optimization algorithm due to\nits demonstrated effectiveness across multiple studies (Shao et al., 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025).\n4\nEXPERIMENTS\n4.1\nEXPERIMENT SETUP\nModel and data.\nWe conduct experiments with the Qwen2.5-1.5B-it and Qwen2.5-7B-it instruction-\ntuned models (Yang et al., 2024) which have context window length of 8192. The ground-truth scores\nfor solution verification are provided by Math-Verify 1. For our training data, we use mathematical\n1https://github.com/huggingface/Math-Verify\n6\n\nTable 3: Prompt Template for our STEPWISER judge.\nPrompt Template for STEPWISER Judge\nInstruction:\nYou are a reasoning validator for mathematical problems. Your task is to think step by step and determine\nif the \u201cNew Reasoning Chunk\u201d contains any explicit errors based on the problem description and\nhistorical context.\nFirst, you must always perform a step-by-step chain of thought analysis to justify your final judgment.\nThen, based on your analysis, you will make a definitive judgment. It is OK that the chunk does not\ncontain any numerical calculation.\nBased on your evaluation, provide your final judgment:\n\u2022 Use Positive if the reasoning chunk is free of mistakes.\n\u2022 Use Negative if the reasoning chunk contains one or more mistakes.\nInput:\nMathematical Problem: {problem}\nHistorical Reasoning Path: {history}\nNew Reasoning Chunk: {chunk}\nOutput format:\n1.

Before training, we preprocess\nthe dataset by first removing duplicate prompts. We then use Math-Verify to extract the final answer\nfrom each reference solution and score it against the labeled ground truth. We discard any prompts\nwhere Math-Verify cannot successfully verify the answer. Unless otherwise specified, we focus\non using the same base model to initialize both the policy and the judge. We will also conduct\nexperiments to study how the choice of base model affects the judge\u2019s evaluation ability.\nSelf-segmentation fine-tuning.\nTo create demonstration data for self-segmentation, we use a\nrandom subset of 20k prompts from NuminaMath-CoT. First, we generate 16 responses for each\nprompt using the base policy model (i.e., Qwen2.5-1.5B-it). Next, we filter out incorrect responses,\nkeeping up to 4 correct solutions per prompt. We then prompt the strong Llama-3.1-70B-it (Meta,\n2024) to segment these correct responses according to the rules in Table 1. We generate 8 segmenta-\ntions for each response and only keep those that perfectly reconstructed the original response and\nfollow the required format. Finally, we fine-tune the base model on this collected data to create\nQwen2.5-1.5B-chunk. For this fine-tuning, we use the open-source Axolotl package2 with a learning\nrate of 1e \u22125, a packing block size of 8192 tokens, and a global batch size of 32. The setup for\nQwen2.5-7B-chunk is similar. We provide the prompt template we use for the response generation\nin Table 11. Table 4 reports both the average number of steps (evaluated on 10K randomly selected\nprompts from NuminaMath) and the average@32 performance on MATH500. After self-segmentation\nfine-tuning, the resulting models achieve comparable or slightly better test accuracy on MATH500,\nwhile maintaining similar response lengths. Notably, the number of steps decreases significantly\ncompared to commonly used splitting by \\n\\n, from 9.6 to 6.0 with 1.5B model and from 9.9 to 6.8\nwith the 7B model, suggesting that the models generate responses in a more organized and structured\nmanner. An illustrative example is shown in Table 2, and additional case studies can be found in\nthe Appendix. Meanwhile, we observe that for most current open-source thinking models that do\nlong reasoning before answering, the number of steps exceeds 150 when trajectories are segmented\n2https://github.com/axolotl-ai-cloud\n7\n\nTable 4: Comparison of the base policy with and without self-segmentation fine-tuning.

Due to resource constraints, we do not\nexperiment with these thinking models. However, we expect that our self-segmentation technique\nwould be particularly beneficial in this setting, which we leave for future exploration.\nStepwise data annotation.\nWe select a subset of 40k prompts from NuminaMath for stepwise data\nannotation based on a pre-filtering process using the pass@k metric. Specifically, for each prompt,\nwe generate 16 responses using our chunk-tuned models (e.g., Qwen2.5-1.5B-chunk). To ensure the\nselected prompts are of a suitable difficulty, we filter out prompts where the responses were either\nall correct or all incorrect. During generation, we use a temperature of 1.0 and set the maximum\ntoken limit to 8192, or until the model produced a final answer. Then, for each intermediate step in\na solution, we sample another M = 16 completions staring from that step for estimating Q-values,\nas specified in Equation 2. The intermediate labels are then assigned according to the methods\ndescribed in Section 3.2. Here we mainly follow the annotation framework from previous literature\n(Wang et al., 2023; Xiong et al., 2024b), which is well-suited to our specific research questions.\nWhile advanced engineering\u2014such as employing model ensembles for generation or using powerful\nLLMs/human for label verification (Zhang et al., 2025)\u2014may enhance results, these engineering\nstrategies are orthogonal to our main contribution, and we believe they could be integrated for\nfuture improvements. The data annotation takes approximately 14 days on 8 A100 GPUs using\nQwen2.5-7B-chunk model, making it computationally expensive. We notice that self-segmentation\nfine-tuning significantly reduces the number of chunks during trajectory splitting, thereby saving\nsubstantial compute and annotation time. We also present additional ablation results with and without\nchunking in Appendix A.3.\nJudge RL training details.\nWe implement the GRPO algorithm using the verl library (Sheng et al.,\n2024). During each training step, we use a per-prompt batch size of 1024 and a gradient update\nmini-batch size of 256. For the GRPO training process, the judge model generates 4 responses for\neach prompt. The maximum prompt length is set to 3096 tokens, and the model can generate up to\n3096 new tokens. The learning rate is set to 1e \u22126.\nIn our initial experiments, we observe that the model\u2019s entropy decreases rapidly, particularly for\nthe 7B model. Since our verification task is a binary classification (correct/incorrect), low entropy\ncauses the model to generate 4 responses with identical final judgments. This leads to zero gradients\nduring the GRPO update, causing performance to get stuck after approximately 200 training steps. To\nmitigate this issue, we adopt the clip higher technique (Yu et al., 2025), using \u03f5h = 0.28 and \u03f5l = 0.2.\nWe expect that more advanced methods, such as those proposed by Lanchantin et al. (2025), could\nfurther alleviate this issue.\nWe apply a heuristic filtering process to remove prompts that were overly short or excessively long.\nAdditionally, we find that our threshold-based labeling method often results in an imbalance between\npositive and negative examples. Therefore, we down-sample the majority class to create a balanced\ntraining set to stabilize training. We will also include an ablation study on this process.\nWe run the training for 800 steps, which takes approximately 5 days on 8 A100 GPUs (for Qwen2.5-\n7B-chunk models). We present a typical reward curve and an entropy loss curve in Appendix\nFigure 4.\n8\n\n4.2\nEVALUATION ON PROCESSBENCH\nWe first evaluate our method STEPWISER on ProcessBench (Zheng et al., 2024), a benchmark\ndesigned to test the ability to identify the first incorrect step in a reasoning trajectory, as labeled\nby human annotators. The benchmark contains 3500 problem-solution pairs from diverse math\ndatasets (GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021), Olympiad Bench (He et al.,\n2024a), and Omni-MATH (Gao et al., 2024)). Performance is measured by the harmonic mean3 of\nthe accuracy on problems with correct final answers acc1 and those with incorrect final answers acc2,\ncalculated as:\n2 \u00d7 acc1 \u00d7 acc2\nacc1 + acc2\n.\n(4)\nOur RL-trained STEPWISER judge significantly outperforms SFT-trained discriminative judges\nOur primary results on ProcessBench are presented in Table 5. The findings show that our RL-trained\nSTEPWISER judge significantly outperforms all variants of the SFT-trained discriminative judge.\nThis holds true across all learning signals (Abs-Q, Rel-Ratio, Rel-Effective) and model\nscales. For instance, on the 7B model with the Rel-Effective signal, STEPWISER achieves\nan average score of 61.9, far surpassing the discriminative baseline\u2019s 39.7. This demonstrates that\ncombining explicit reasoning generation with online RL training is a more effective strategy. As\na reference, we also include several models from the open-source community that adopt similar\ndiscriminative training pipelines. These include model Math-Shepherd-PRM-7B (Wang et al., 2023),\nbased on Mistral-7B, and RLHFlow-Llama3-8B-it (Xiong et al., 2024b), and Skywork-Qwen2.5-\nMath-7B-it (He et al., 2024b). Notably, the performance of these community-trained models is worse\nor comparable to that of our reproduced SFT-trained discriminative judge, and they similarly lag far\nbehind our RL-trained STEPWISER judge. Therefore, we conclude that the stepwise judge benefits\nfrom our proposed recipe of explicit reasoning traces and online reward optimization by RL.\nOur RL-trained STEPWISER judge significantly outperforms existing RL-trained judges\nFur-\nthermore, we benchmark STEPWISER against other models trained with online methods like online\nDPO (Xiong et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023) or GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) (e.g., Eurus-7B, RL-TANGO-\n7B). Unlike our method, these models are supervised at the trajectory level, using only the final\nanswer\u2019s correctness as a reward signal, denoted by \u201cOutcome\u201d in Table 5. STEPWISER models,\nwhich are trained on explicit step-level signals from Monte-Carlo estimation, also surpass these\nbaselines by a large margin. For example, our best 7B model scores 61.9 while RL-TANGO scores\n43.9. This result strongly suggests that direct, step-level supervision provides a much richer and more\neffective learning signal than a sparse, outcome-only reward.\nTest-time compute scaling via majority voting.\nSince STEPWISER perform evaluation via CoT\nreasoning, a natural extension is to generate multiple judgments and use majority voting to decide\nthe final judgment. We apply majority voting with the Qwen2.5-7B-chunk model, and the results\nare presented in Table 5. We can see that the majority voting shows consistent improvements in\nthe Processbench score across various labeling methods. However, the overall gain from majority\nvoting is modest compared to what is often observed in standard mathematical reasoning tasks. We\nhypothesize this is because our evaluation at each step is binary (correct vs. incorrect), resulting in a\nmuch narrower output space than the richer answer spaces typical in math reasoning. In such broader\ntasks, majority voting is more effective at reducing noise and improving robustness. In contrast, the\nbinary nature of our judgments limits the potential benefit from aggregating multiple outputs.\n4.3\nANALYSIS OF THE PERFORMANCE GAP\nTo better understand the source of the performance gap observed on ProcessBench, we isolate the\ncontribution of each component by comparing STEPWISER against three specialized baselines:\n\u2022 Ablate RL. A STEPWISER judge trained with rejection sampling fine-tuning (RS-FT,\noffline): We fine-tune the base model on a static dataset created via rejection sampling, a\ncommon offline approach. This isolates the effect of using the CoT format without online\nRL.\n3Note that while this score was referred to as the F1 score in the original paper, it is different from the\nstandard F1 score.\n9\n\nTable 5: ProcessBench results. The score of each subset is computed via Equation 4. Average\naccuracy (Avg) of our method STEPWISER is better than all variants of our discriminative baselines,\nand existing baselines in the literature (first rows).

For this study, we focus on the Rel-Ratio signal, where additional results with other\nlabeling approaches are deferred to Appendix since the general trend is similar. The results, presented\nin Table 6 and Figure 2, clearly demonstrate that removing either component leads to a significant\ndrop in performance.\nBoth the generative CoT and online RL contribute to the performance improvement.\nThe\nimportance of online learning is evident when comparing our full STEPWISER model to the RS-FT\n10\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nFinal\nReasoning steps\n60.0\n62.5\n65.0\n67.5\n70.0\n72.5\n75.0\n77.5\nJudge accuracy (%)\nDiscriminative + SFT\nDiscriminative + RL\nStepWiser + RL\nStepWiser + Rejection SFT\n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\nOptimization steps\n0.67\n0.68\n0.69\n0.70\n0.71\n0.72\nTraining loss\nRel-Ratio + Rejection SFT\nFigure 2: STEPWISER ablation results.

Here we plot\nthe results of Rel-Ratio using Qwen2.5-1.5B-chunk, other results are presented in the Appendix\nfor completeness (see Figure 5). Right: the training loss of rejection sampling fine-tuning, which\nsaturates quickly.\nbaseline. On ProcessBench results with Qwen2.5-1.5B-chunk model, the RS-FT model achieves an\naverage score of only 23.1, which is substantially lower than STEPWISER\u2019s score of 36.2 and is even\nworse than the standard discriminative SFT baseline (24.1). To understand this phenomena, we plot\nthe loss curve of rejection sampling fine-tuning in Figure 2 (right). We notice that its training loss on\na large, static dataset plateaus quickly. This trend is consistent with other learning signals and the\nlarger 7B model, indicating that offline methods are insufficient to capture the complexity of CoT\nreasoning and reward modeling, making online RL a critical component.\nSTEPWISER judges with CoT leverage the intrinsic reasoning ability to obtain better evaluation.\nThe benefit of the generative CoT format is illustrated by the \u201cNo CoT\u201d baseline. With Qwen2.5-1.5B-\nchunk model, augmenting a discriminative-style judge with RL boosts the ProcessBench score from\n24.1 (SFT) to 34.3 (RL), but it still falls short of STEPWISER\u2019s 36.2. Moreover, the in-distribution\naccuracy results in Figure 2 (left) show that STEPWISER with CoT reasoning achieves higher accuracy\non the held-out data. This suggests that generating explicit rationales provides a more expressive\nand informative structure for learning and modeling the stepwise reward signal. The gap between\nthe generative CoT model and the discriminative model becomes much larger with the stronger\nQwen2.5-7B-chunk. Specifically, the generative STEPWISER admits an average score of 60.5, while\nthe discriminative only achieves 47.9. This is because we are leveraging the intrinsic reasoning ability\nof the base model through CoT in the judgment so the stronger model offers more advantages.\nPrompt dataset balancing stabilizes training and mitigate overfitting.\nThe practice of balancing\nthe prompt dataset is also crucial for robust performance. Our ablation study on the Qwen2.5-7B-\nchunk model shows that removing this balancing step causes a substantial performance drop, with the\naverage ProcessBench score drops from 60.5 to 47.9. A deeper analysis reveals that while both the\n\u201cNo CoT\u201d ablation and the lack of dataset balancing hurt performance, their underlying failure modes\nare different. The \u201cNo CoT\u201d model suffers from a general decline in its ability to recognize correct\nand incorrect steps. In contrast, without balancing, the prompt dataset is heavily biased towards\npositive examples. This trains the model to be overly optimistic, developing a strong bias towards\npredicting any given step as correct. This bias is particularly enhanced during online training. This\neventually leads to training instability and model collapse. A detailed analysis of this phenomenon is\nprovided in the Appendix A.4.\n4.4\nUSING STEPWISER JUDGE TO OBTAIN BETTER SOLUTIONS\nIn this section, we evaluate the practical utility of our RL-trained STEPWISER judge in two common\napplications: guiding an LLM\u2019s reasoning process at inference time and selecting high-quality data\nfor subsequent fine-tuning.\n11\n\nTable 7: Inference time search via Chunk-Reset Reasoning. We report results with both Qwen2.5-\n1.5B-chunk and Qwen2.5-7B-chunk, using them as both the response generators and the initialization\ncheckpoints for the STEPWISER judge.

Inference-Time Search via Chunk-Reset Reasoning To leverage STEPWISER judge for\nimproved reasoning, we employ an inference-time search strategy. The base policy model\ngenerates a solution \u201cchunk-by-chunk\u201d. After each chunk is produced, STEPWISER judge\nevaluates it. If the chunk is considered to be good, it is accepted, and the model proceeds to\nthe next step. If it is rejected, the flawed chunk is discarded, and the model re-generates a\nnew one from the same point (up to 5 attempts). This allows the model to self-correct and\nexplore alternative reasoning paths without committing to an early mistake, enhancing the\nfinal solution\u2019s quality. Meanwhile, this reasoning paradigm allows for scaling sequential\ncompute (i.e., the compute used to extend a single inference trajectory with additional steps,\nrather than running many independent trajectories in parallel), while the overall number of\naccepted tokens remains similar.\n2. Training Data Selection via Stepwise Rejection Sampling Fine-tuning. Rejection Sam-\npling Fine-tuning (Dong et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023) is a standard technique to improve\na base policy by fine-tuning it on its own best outputs. The high-level intuition is that, when\nthe models are allowed to generate N responses per prompt, the pass@N is usually much\nhigher than the random one (pass@1). Therefore, we can use a proxy reward model to\nselect a training set from the self-generated responses, and train on this set to improve the\nbase policy. However, for mathematical reasoning, verifying only the final answer provides\na coarse, binary signal (correct/incorrect) that struggles to differentiate between multiple\ncorrect solutions. Here we use STEPWISER judge to compute the scores for each individual\nreasoning chunk, and use the average score as a proxy to pick the best response.\nThe results for inference-time search and data selection are presented in Table 7 and Table 8,\nrespectively. We summarize the key findings below.\nConsistent performance improvements in both setups\nIn both applications, using our STEP-\nWISER judge leads to superior outcomes. For inference time search (Table 7), with the Rel-Ratio\nlearning signal, our approach guides the 1.5B model to achieve an average accuracy of 36.9%, a\nsignificant improvement over the 31.2% of the base model. We also see clear trends of STEPWISER\nmodel being superior to the disciminative models across all learning signals. This trend holds for\nthe 7B model, demonstrating the scalability of our method. Similarly, when used for data selection\n(Table 8), models fine-tuned on data selected by STEPWISER judge achieve the highest performance\n(63.0%), surpassing the original base model (60.1%), as well as data selected by a discriminative\njudge (61.9%) or outcome-based selection (60.9%).\n12\n\nTable 8: Data selection via Stepwise Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning.

However, the\n\u201cRejected Length\u201d column, which corresponds to chunks that judged to be flawed, indicates that our\nmodel generates more total tokens to arrive at its final answer. We interpret this as direct evidence\nof STEPWISER\u2019s superior ability to identify incorrect or unproductive steps. This triggers the reset\nmechanism more effectively, forcing the model to discard flawed reasoning and find a better path.\nThis is also consistent with the higher accuracy of identifying the error step on ProcessBench (see\nalso Table 10 in the appendix).\nRelative signals are more effective for assigning chunk labels.\nWe also observe that across both\ntables, training signals that reward relative progress (Rel-Effective, Rel-Ratio) consis-\ntently yield better judges than a signal that only measures a step\u2019s absolute quality (Abs-Q). This\nappears to be consistent across all results in the paper, for all model sizes and evaluation setups. For\nexample, in inference time search, the Rel-Effective judge achieves a 64.3% average accuracy,\noutperforming the Abs-Q judge (61.9%). This pattern is also confirmed in data selection, where the\nRel-Effective judge produces the best fine-tuning dataset, leading to a final model with 63.0%\naccuracy, again surpassing the Abs-Q judge (62.5%).\n5\nCONCLUSION\nReasoning models that output internal thought tokens before a final response have proven to outper-\nform non-reasoning models. In this paper we have shown that further improvements can be found\nby making models reason about the reasoning decisions made within those internal thoughts. We\nprovide a recipe to: (1) segment reasoning into chunks-of-thought; (2) assign rewards to chunks via\nrelative outcomes of rollouts; and (3) train a judge model to reason about the quality of CoT chunks\nvia reinforcement learning (RL).\nOur stepwise generative judge STEPWISER is shown to be superior to existing methods on Process-\nBench, to provide improved inference time search, and better training time rewards for building better\nresponse models. We show that both the use of reasoning during judgement, and training with RL in\norder to reason about reasoning, are important components to achieve this performance.\nREFERENCES\nEdward Beeching, Shengyi Costa Huang, Albert Jiang, Jia Li, Benjamin Lipkin, Zihan Qina, Kashif\nRasul, Ziju Shen, Roman Soletskyi, and Lewis Tunstall.

(2024b) to formulate the discrimi-\nnative stepwise judge as a multi-turn conversation task. Specifically, in every user turn, we provide\na single step of reasoning, while in the next assistant turn, the model will decode either \u201c+\u201d or \u201c-\u201d\ntoken to indicate its judgment. For training, we use standard SFT code. The data is packed into block\nwith length 8192 tokens. We use a learning rate of 1e \u22125, a global batch size of 32. We also mask\nout the user turn\u2019s loss. We present the representative training loss curves in Figure 3.\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\n1400\nOptimization Steps\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\n0.40\n0.45\nTraining Loss\nDiscriminative: Rel-Effective + SFT, 1.5B\nDiscriminative: Rel-Ratio + SFT, 1.5B\nDiscriminative: Abs-Q + SFT, 1.5B\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\nOptimization Steps\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n1.2\nTraining Loss\nDiscriminative: Rel-Effective + SFT, 7B\nDiscriminative: Rel-Ratio + SFT, 7B\nDiscriminative: Abs-Q + SFT, 7B\nFigure 3: The training loss curves of discriminative stepwise judge under different learning signals.\nLeft: 1.5B model, Right: 7B model.\nHyperparameter search for stepwise labeling.\nWe conduct hyperparameter tuning for the learning\nsignals labeling. We mainly search by training discriminative models and SFT training, as this\nis more computationally efficient than full RL training. For Rel-Ratio, we search over \u03b3 \u2208\n{0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2}, and for Rel-Effective, we search over \u03b1 \u2208{0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0}\nwith a fixed N = 4. For Qwen2.5-1.5B-chunk, we choose \u03b3 = 0.8 and \u03b1 = 0.4, while for\nQwen2.5-7B-chunk, we use \u03b3 = 0.7 and \u03b1 = 0.8.\nLearning curves of RL training.\nWe present a representative example of training reward, entropy\nloss, and response length with and without clip higher technique. The model is Qwen2.5-7B-chunk\nand the learning signal is Rel-Ratio with threshold 0.7. We can see that clip higher helps to\nencourage exploration and leads to a higher training curve.\nPrompt dataset balance technique.\nIn our early experiments, we observed that the prompt sets\ncould be highly imbalanced. For example, using the Qwen2.5-1.5B-chunk model, the proportion of\npositive samples for Rel-Ratio with a threshold of 0.8 is 56.5%, while for Abs-Q, it is 70.2%.\nSuch imbalance may cause model degeneration, as the model can achieve a high score by simply\npredicting \u201ccorrect\u201d in most cases. To address this, we consider a prompt balance technique that\ndown-samples the majority class. We defer a detailed analysis to Appendix A.4.\nA.2\nADDITIONAL RESULT ON CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY\nWe plot the stepwise classification accuracy under different learning signals in Figure 5. For\nRel-Ratio and Rel-Effective, we observe that the RL-trained generative STEPWISER judge\nachieves significantly higher test accuracy on both intermediate steps and final answer correctness.\nThis suggests that the additional reasoning steps enable a more expressive model class that better\nfits the learning signal. In contrast, for Abs-Q, the performance gap between the discriminative\nand generative judges is relatively small. We suspect this is because the Abs-Q dataset has a high\nproportion (70.2%) of positive samples. To stabilize RL training, we down-sample the positive\nclass, which may introduce distribution shift and affect test classification accuracy. Nevertheless, our\nSTEPWISER model still achieves substantially higher accuracy in evaluating final answer correctness.\n17\n\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\nOptimization Steps\n0.58\n0.60\n0.62\n0.64\n0.66\n0.68\n0.70\nTraining Reward\nGenerative Reasoning:Rel-Ratio with Clip Higher\nGenerative Reasoning:Rel-Ratio without Clip Higher\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\nOptimization Steps\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\nEntropy Loss\nGenerative Reasoning:Rel-Ratio with Clip Higher\nGenerative Reasoning:Rel-Ratio without Clip Higher\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\nOptimization Steps\n400\n450\n500\n550\n600\n650\n700\n750\nResponse Length\nGenerative Reasoning:Rel-Ratio with Clip Higher\nGenerative Reasoning:Rel-Ratio without Clip Higher\nFigure 4: A representative example of training reward, entropy loss, and response length with\nand without clip higher technique.

The\nprimary goal was to assess the efficacy of teaching a model to segment its own reasoning trajectories.\nOne of the most significant findings is the substantial improvement in computational efficiency. By\nimplementing self-segmentation, the number of required processing steps was reduced early 40%.\nThis optimization is critical, as it translates to considerable savings in computational resources; for\ncontext, the annotation of 40000 prompts typically requires 2 to 3 weeks with 8x A100 GPUs.\nIn terms of task performance, the benefits of self-segmentation are most apparent in the context of\nRL training. While the average scores for SFT are closer (27.5 vs. 27.2 for Abs-Q), models trained\nwith RL show significant improvements. Specifically, the average score for Abs-Q + RL increased\nfrom 32.4 to 36.1, and the Rel-Ratio + RL score rose from 31.0 to 36.2. This disparity suggests\nthat the self-segmentation process effectively filters out noisy and less informative steps from the\nreasoning trajectories. The resulting cleaner signal is highly beneficial for the RL training process,\nwhich is more sensitive to data quality. This observation is also consistent with our findings from\nthe prompt filtering and balancing experiments. Conversely, SFT appears more robust to this type of\nnoise, and thus its performance is less impacted.\nA.4\nADDITIONAL ABLATION RESULT ON COT AND PROMPT DATASET BALANCING\nWe present the detailed results of ablation on CoT and prompt dataset balancing in Table 10. The\nresults reveal that while the absence of either component degrades the final F1 score, the underlying\nreasons for the performance drop are fundamentally different.\nThe removal of CoT appears to weaken the model\u2019s overall ability to discriminate between correct and\nincorrect reasoning steps. This is evidenced by a general decline in accuracy for both the \u201cCorrect\u201d\nand \u201cError\u201d classifications across the datasets. In contrast, removing dataset balancing introduces\na strong class bias. Without balancing, the model is trained on a dataset where correct steps are\noverrepresented, causing it to overfit and develop a tendency to classify most steps as correct. This is\nclearly demonstrated by a sharp increase in accuracy for the \u201cCorrect\u201d class, coupled with a significant\ndecrease in accuracy for the \u201cError\u201d class. While the model becomes proficient at identifying correct\nsteps, it largely loses its ability to detect errors. This trade-off is ultimately detrimental, as shown by\nthe identical drop in the average F1 score from 60.5 to 47.9 for the Rel-Ratio model.\nB\nTEMPLATE, EXAMPLE, AND ADDITIONAL TABLES\n19\n\nTable 10: Model performance on the ProcessBench, broken down by four subsets.

For example, J = 35214 is a 5-label and\nK = 132 is a 3-label. For a fixed positive integer p, where p \u2264n, consider consecutive blocks of p\nnumbers in an n-label. For example, when p = 3 and L = 263415, the blocks are 263, 634, 341, and\n415. We can associate to each of these blocks a p-label that corresponds to the relative order of the\nnumbers in that block. For L = 263415, we get the following:\n263 415 \u2192132;\n263415 \u2192312;\n263415 \u2192231;\n263415 \u2192213\nMoving from left to right in the n-label, there are n \u2212p + 1 such blocks, which means we obtain an\n(n \u2212p + 1)-tuple of p-labels. For L = 263415, we get the 4-tuple (132, 312, 231, 213). We will call\nthis (n \u2212p + 1)-tuple the p-signature of L (or signature, if p is clear from the context) and denote it by\nSp[L]; the p-labels in the signature are called windows. For L = 263415, the windows are 132, 312,\n231, and 213, and we write\nS3[263415] = (132, 312, 231, 213)\nMore generally, we will call any (n \u2212p + 1)-tuple of p-labels a p-signature, even if we do not know of\nan n-label to which it corresponds (and even if no such label exists). A signature that occurs for exactly\none n-label is called unique, and a signature that doesn\u2019t occur for any n-labels is called impossible. A\npossible signature is one that occurs for at least one n-label.\nIn this power question, you will be asked to analyze some of the properties of labels and signatures.\nCompute the 3-signature for 52341.\nHistorical Reasoning Path\nTo compute the 3-signature of the 5-label L = 52341, we need to identify all the consecutive blocks of\n3 numbers in the label and then convert each block into its corresponding 3-label based on the relative\norder of the numbers.\nFirst, identify the first block: 523. The relative order of the numbers 5, 2, and 3 is 3, 1, and 2\nrespectively. Therefore, the 3-label for this block is 312.\nSecond, identify the second block: 234. The relative order of the numbers 2, 3, and 4 is 1, 2, and 3\nrespectively. Therefore, the 3-label for this block is 123.\nNew Reasoning Chunk\nThird, identify the third block: 341. The relative order of the numbers 3, 4, and 1 is 2, 3, and 1\nrespectively. Therefore, the 3-label for this block is 231.\nJudgment\nTo determine if the \u201dNew Reasoning chunk\u201d contains any explicit errors, we need to verify the logic for\nidentifying the 3-label of the block 341 in the 5-label 52341.\nThe new reasoning chunk states:\nThird, identify the third block: 341. The relative order of the numbers 3, 4, and 1 is\n2, 3, and 1 respectively. Therefore, the 3-label for this block is 231.\nLet\u2019s check the relative order of the numbers in the block 341:\n\u2022 The number 3 is greater than 1 but less than 4.\n\u2022 The number 4 is greater than both 3 and 1.\n\u2022 The number 1 is the smallest.\nThus, the relative order of the numbers 3, 4, and 1 is indeed 2, 3, and 1 respectively. This means the\n3-label for the block 341 is 231.\nSince the reasoning follows correctly from the definition of a 3-label, the \u201dNew Reasoning chunk\u201d does\nnot contain any explicit errors.\nTherefore, the final judgment is:\nPositive\n25\n\nTable 17: Illustrative example from the Process-Bench dataset, where the ground-truth label is\n\u201cincorrect.\u201d The judge model is STEPWISER with Rel-Ratio and Qwen2.5-7B-chunk.

Given a\npositive integer n, Alice and Bob play the following game.\nIn the first round, Alice takes n pebbles and distributes them into the 60 boxes as she wishes. Each\nsubsequent round consists of two steps:\n(a) Bob chooses an integer k with 1 \u2264k \u226459 and splits the boxes into the two groups B1, . . . , Bk and\nBk+1, . . . , B60.\n(b) Alice picks one of these two groups, adds one pebble to each box in that group, and removes one\npebble from each box in the other group.\nBob wins if, at the end of any round, some box contains no pebbles. Find the smallest n such that Alice\ncan prevent Bob from winning.\nHistorical Reasoning Path\nTo find the smallest n such that Alice can prevent Bob from winning, we need to understand the\nconstraints imposed by Bob\u2019s moves and how Alice can counter them. Let\u2019s consider the minimum\nnumber of pebbles each box must have after the first round. Since there are 60 boxes and Alice\ndistributes n pebbles among them, the minimum number of pebbles each box will get is\n\u0004 n\n60\n\u0005\n, where\n\u230ax\u230brepresents the greatest integer less than or equal to x.\nNew Reasoning Chunk\nNow, let\u2019s analyze Bob\u2019s move in each round. In step (a), he splits the boxes into two groups of size k\nand 60 \u2212k. In step (b), Alice adds a pebble to each box in the chosen group and removes a pebble from\neach box in the other group. For Alice to prevent Bob from winning, each box must have at least one\npebble after her move. This means that the difference between the total number of pebbles in the chosen\ngroup and the other group should be at most 1.\nJudgment\nLet\u2019s break this down step by step:\n1. **Understanding Bob\u2019s Move**: In step (a), Bob splits the boxes into two groups of size k\nand 60 \u2212k. In step (b), Alice adds one pebble to each box in the chosen group and removes\none pebble from each box in the other group. This means that the total number of pebbles in\nthe chosen group increases by k and the total number of pebbles in the other group decreases\nby 60 \u2212k.\n2. **Condition for Alice to Prevent Bob from Winning**: For Alice to prevent Bob from\nwinning, each box must have at least one pebble after her move. However, the statement\n\u201dthe difference between the total number of pebbles in the chosen group and the other group\nshould be at most 1\u201d is not necessarily true. The correct condition would be that the difference\nin the total number of pebbles between the two groups after Alice\u2019s move should not cause\nany box to have zero pebbles.\nThe reasoning in the new reasoning chunk assumes that the difference in the number of pebbles\nbetween the two groups should be at most 1, which is not necessarily the case.\nThe correct\ncondition would be that after Alice\u2019s move, the number of pebbles in each box should be at least 1, not\nnecessarily that the difference in the total number of pebbles between the two groups should be at most 1.\nTherefore, the \u201dNew Reasoning chunk\u201d contains explicit errors. The correct interpretation of the\ncondition for Alice to prevent Bob from winning is not correctly stated in the new reasoning chunk.\nThe final judgment is:\nNegative\n26\n\nTable 18: Illustrative example from the Process-Bench dataset, where the ground-truth label is\n\u201cincorrect.\u201d The judge model is STEPWISER with Rel-Ratio and Qwen2.5-7B-chunk.

We are given 2n lamps numbered 1\nthrough 2n; each of them can be on or off. At the beginning all lamps are off. We consider sequences of\nk steps. At each step one of the lamps is switched (from off to on or from on to off).\nLet N be the number of k-step sequences ending in the state: lamps 1, . . . , n on, lamps n+1, . . . , 2n off.\nLet M be the number of k-step sequences leading to the same state and not touching lamps\nn + 1, . . . , 2n at all.\nFind the ratio N/M.\nHistorical Reasoning Path\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the number of k-step sequences that end in the state where\nlamps 1, . . . , n are on and lamps n + 1, . . . , 2n are off, and compare it to the number of such sequences\nthat do not touch lamps n + 1, . . . , 2n at all.\nNew Reasoning Chunk\nFirst, we determine N. The total number of lamps is 2n, and we need exactly n of them to be on\nand n to be off. Since the sequence ends with lamps 1, . . . , n on and n + 1, . . . , 2n off, we need to\nswitch exactly n times among the first n lamps and the remaining k \u2212n times among the last n lamps.\nHowever, since the last n lamps are always off, these k \u2212n switches do not affect their state. Therefore,\nwe only need to count the number of ways to choose n steps out of k to switch the first n lamps. This is\ngiven by the binomial coefficient:\nN =\n \nk\nn\n!\n.\nJudgment\nTo determine if the \u201dNew Reasoning chunk\u201d contains any explicit errors, we need to carefully analyze\nthe statement and check its logic step by step.\nThe reasoning chunk suggests that N, the number of k-step sequences ending in the state where lamps\n1, . . . , n are on and lamps n + 1, . . . , 2n are off, is given by the binomial coefficient\n\u0000k\nn\n\u0001. However,\nthis conclusion is not necessarily correct because it does not take into account the specific sequence of\nswitching the lamps.\nThe correct approach to find N is to consider that we need exactly n switches among the first n lamps\nto turn them on, and the remaining k \u2212n switches can be any combination of the n lamps (including\npossibly switching some lamps on and off multiple times, but ensuring that at the end, each of the first\nn lamps is on). The number of such sequences is not simply\n\u0000k\nn\n\u0001, because it does not account for the\nspecific order in which the switches occur.\nIn fact, the correct way to calculate N is more complex and involves considering the parity of k and\nn (which are the same) and the specific sequences of switching. The reasoning chunk simplifies the\nproblem incorrectly by assuming that any n switches among the first n lamps will result in all of them\nbeing on, without considering the constraints of the problem.\nTherefore, the \u201dNew Reasoning chunk\u201d contains explicit errors. The correct reasoning would involve a\nmore detailed analysis of the sequences of switches, taking into account the parity and the specific\nrequirements of the problem.\nThe final judgment is:\nNegative\n27\n\nTable 19: Illustrative example from the Process-Bench dataset, where the ground-truth label is\n\u201cincorrect.\u201d The judge model is STEPWISER with Rel-Ratio and Qwen2.5-7B-chunk.

The triangle inequality states that the sum of the lengths of any\ntwo sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Therefore, we have the\nfollowing three inequalities: First, x + f(y) > f(y + f(x) \u22121) Second, x + f(y + f(x) \u22121) > f(y)\nThird, f(y) + f(y + f(x) \u22121) > x\nWe will analyze these inequalities one by one.\n### Step 1: Analyze the inequality x + f(y) > f(y + f(x) \u22121)\nThis inequality can be rewritten as:\nf(y + f(x) \u22121) < x + f(y)\nThis tells us that f(y + f(x) \u22121) is strictly less than x + f(y).\nNew Reasoning Chunk\n### Step 2: Analyze the inequality x + f(y + f(x) \u22121) > f(y)\nThis inequality can be rewritten as:\nf(y + f(x) \u22121) > f(y) \u2212x\nThis tells us that f(y + f(x) \u22121) is strictly greater than f(y) \u2212x. Since f(y) and x are positive\nintegers, f(y) \u2212x could be negative or zero, but f(y + f(x) \u22121) must be a positive integer. Therefore,\nthe smallest possible value for f(y) \u2212x is 0, which means f(y) \u2265x.\nJudgment\nTo determine if the \u201dNew Reasoning chunk\u201d contains any explicit errors, we need to analyze the given\ninequality x + f(y + f(x) \u22121) > f(y) and see if it leads to the conclusion that f(y) \u2265x.\nStarting with the inequality:\nx + f(y + f(x) \u22121) > f(y)\nwe can rearrange it to:\nf(y + f(x) \u22121) > f(y) \u2212x\nSince f(y) and x are positive integers, f(y) \u2212x could be negative or zero. However, f(y + f(x) \u22121)\nmust be a positive integer. This means that f(y) \u2212x must be less than f(y + f(x) \u22121), but it does\nnot necessarily mean that f(y) \u2265x. The inequality f(y + f(x) \u22121) > f(y) \u2212x only tells us that\nf(y) \u2212x is less than a positive integer, which does not imply that f(y) itself must be at least x.\nTherefore, the reasoning in the new reasoning chunk contains an explicit error in its conclusion\nthat f(y) \u2265x. The correct interpretation of the inequality f(y + f(x) \u22121) > f(y) \u2212x does not\nnecessarily lead to f(y) \u2265x.\nThe final judgment is:\nNegative\n28\n\nTable 20: Illustrative example from the Process-Bench dataset, where the ground-truth label is\n\u201cincorrect.\u201d The judge model is STEPWISER with Rel-Ratio and Qwen2.5-7B-chunk. We\nhighlight the key parts of the reasoning trajectory in red.\nExample\nMathematical Problem\nHow many ways are there to put 4 balls in 3 boxes if the balls are distinguishable but the boxes are not?\nHistorical Reasoning Path\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the number of ways to distribute 4 distinguishable balls into 3 indistinguishable boxes.\nStep 1: Counting the total number of distributions if the boxes were distinguishable. If the boxes were distinguishable, each ball\nwould have 3 choices (3 boxes). Since there are 4 distinguishable balls, the total number of distributions would be 34 = 81.\nHowever, since the boxes are indistinguishable, we need to adjust for overcounting.\nStep 2: Identifying the cases where the boxes are indistinguishable. There are three main cases where the boxes are indistinguishable:\nFirst, all 4 balls in one box (1 way).\nSecond, 3 balls in one box and 1 ball in another box (4 ways, since the balls are distinguishable and we can choose any of the 4 balls\nto be alone).\nThird, 2 balls in one box and 2 balls in another box (6 ways, since there are 6 pairs of balls that can be in the same box). However,\nthese cases also include some overcounting since the boxes are indistinguishable. We need to adjust for this overcounting.\nNew Reasoning Chunk\nStep 3: Adjusting for overcounting. In case 2, when we have 3 balls in one box and 1 ball in another box, we counted each distribution\n3 times (since there are 3 boxes and we could swap the lone ball with the other balls). So, we divide by 3 for this case. In case 3,\nwhen we have 2 balls in one box and 2 balls in another box, we counted each distribution 6/2 = 3 times (since there are 3 pairs of\nboxes). So, we divide by 3 for this case. Now we have:\n\u2022 Case 1: 1 way\n\u2022 Case 2: 4 / 3 ways\n\u2022 Case 3: 6 / 3 ways\nJudgment\nTo determine if the \u201dNew Reasoning chunk\u201d contains any explicit errors, we need to carefully analyze the reasoning step by step.\nThe new reasoning chunk states: In case 2, when we have 3 balls in one box and 1 ball in another box, we counted each distribution 3\ntimes (since there are 3 boxes and we could swap the lone ball with the other balls). So, we divide by 3 for this case. In case 3, when\nwe have 2 balls in one box and 2 balls in another box, we counted each distribution 6/2 = 3 times (since there are 3 pairs of boxes).\nSo, we divide by 3 for this case...\nLet\u2019s evaluate each case:\nCase 2: 3 balls in one box and 1 ball in another box\nWhen we have 3 balls in one box and 1 ball in another box, we do indeed count each distribution 3 times because we can place the\nsingle ball in any one of the 3 boxes. Therefore, the correct number of distinct distributions for this case is 4 (the number of ways\nto choose which ball will be the single ball) divided by 3, but this division is incorrect because it assumes that each distribution is\ncounted exactly 3 times, which is not necessarily true. The correct approach would be to consider the different ways to assign the\nballs without overcounting due to the indistinguishability of the boxes. The correct count for this case is actually 4, not 4/3.\nCase 3: 2 balls in one box and 2 balls in another box\nWhen we have 2 balls in one box and 2 balls in another box, we need to count the number of ways to partition the 4 balls into two\ngroups of 2. The number of ways to choose 2 balls out of 4 is\n\u00004\n2\n\u0001\n= 6, but since the boxes are indistinguishable, we have counted\neach distribution twice (once for each way to assign the groups to the boxes). Therefore, the correct number of distinct distributions\nfor this case is 6/2 = 3, which the reasoning chunk correctly states.\nGiven the above analysis, the reasoning in the new reasoning chunk contains an explicit error in its calculation for Case 2. Therefore,\nthe final judgment is:\nNegative\n29\n\nTable 21: Illustrative example of chunk-reset reasoning. The judge model is STEPWISER with\nRel-Effective and Qwen2.5-7B-chunk. In the first attempt of chunk 3, it contains a significant\nalgebraic mistake in the formula relating \u03bb and r.\nExample\nMathematical Problem\n8 singers participate in the arts festival, preparing to arrange m performances, each time 4 of them will perform on stage, requiring\nthat any two of the 8 singers perform together the same number of times. Please design a scheme so that the number of performances\nm is the least.\nChunk 1\nTo solve this problem, we need to ensure that each pair of singers performs together in the same number of performances. This is a\nspecific type of combinatorial design problem, and the solution can be approached using the concept of a balanced incomplete block\ndesign (BIBD).\nHere are the steps to find the solution: 1. Identify the parameters of the BIBD:\n\u2022 Let ( v = 8 ) (the number of singers).\n\u2022 Let ( k = 4 ) (the number of singers performing in each performance).\n\u2022 Let ( r ) be the number of performances each singer participates in.\n\u2022 Let ( \u03bb ) be the number of performances each pair of singers participates in together.\n\u2022 Let ( b ) be the number of performances (the number we need to determine).\nChunk 2\n2. Use the BIBD parameters to derive equations: The equation for the number of performances each singer participates in is (\nr(k-1) = (v-1)\u03bb ). The equation for the number of performances is (b = vr\nk ).\nChunk 3 (first attempt): This step uses the incorrect formula \u03bb = 4(r\u22121)\n7\ninstead of the correct one \u03bb = 3r\n7 .\n3. Determine the value of (\u03bb):\n\u2022 From the first equation, we can express (\u03bb) as (\u03bb = r(k\u22121)\nv\u22121\n).\n\u2022 Substituting ( v = 8 ) and ( k = 4 ), we get (\u03bb = 4r\u22124\n7\n= 4(r\u22121)\n7\n).\n\u2022 Since (\u03bb) must be an integer, ( 4(r-1) ) must be divisible by 7. The smallest positive integer ( r ) that satisfies this\ncondition is ( r = 2 ) (since ( 4(2-1) = 4 ), and 4 is not divisible by 7, the next is ( r = 8 ) which gives ( 4(8-1) = 28 ),\nwhich is divisible by 7).\n\u2022 Therefore, (\u03bb = 28\n7 = 4).\nChunk 3 (second attempt)\n3.Calculate the parameters:\n\u2022 First, we need to find (\u03bb). We know that (r = (v\u22121)\u03bb\nk\u22121\n). For (\u03bb) to be an integer, (v \u22121)\u03bb must be divisible by\n(k \u22121 = 3). So, \u03bb must be a multiple of 3.\n\u2022 Let\u2019s try (\u03bb = 1). Then (r = (8\u22121)\u00b71\n4\u22121\n= 7\n3 ), which is not an integer.\n\u2022 Let\u2019s try (\u03bb = 3). Then (r = (8\u22121)\u00b73\n4\u22121\n= 21\n3 = 7).\n\u2022 Now, we can calculate ( b ): (b = 8\u00b77\n4\n= 14).\nChunk 4\n4. Verify the design:\n\u2022 We need to check if we can indeed arrange 14 performances with 8 singers, 4 at a time, such that each pair of singers\nperforms together exactly 3 times.\n\u2022 his can be verified using known designs or by constructing a specific design, but for the sake of this problem, we assume\nthe existence of such a design.\nTherefore, the least number of performances m is\n14 .\n30\n\nTable 22: Illustrative example of chunk-reset reasoning.

However, most systems\nremain constrained by a linear request-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in\nmulti-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these limitations, we propose Gen-\nerative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm in which LLMs respond to user queries by\nproactively generating user interfaces (UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement.\nOur framework leverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative refinements to\ntranslate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic evaluation, we introduce a multidimen-\nsional assessment framework that compares generative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones\nacross diverse tasks, interaction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and\nemotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces consistently outper-\nform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in over 70% of cases. These findings clarify\nwhen and why users favor generative interfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-\nAI interaction. Data and code are available at https://github.com/SALT-NLP/GenUI.\n1\nINSTRUCTION\nA longstanding goal in computing is to design systems that not only respond to users but also adapt by dynamically\nreshaping interfaces to facilitate users\u2019 interaction and help them achieve their goals (Apple Inc., 1987; Lyytinen &\nYoo, 2002). While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have brought us closer to this vision by enabling\nflexible natural language understanding, the dominant interaction paradigm, which we call the conversational UI,\nremains static and linear: most LLM outputs are still rendered as long blocks of text, regardless of task complexity\nor user preference, limiting the model\u2019s ability to support the diverse ways users seek to learn, explore, and interact.\nAt the same time, state-of-the-art LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities in automatically generating high-quality,\nfunctional webpages from sketches, queries, or natural language descriptions (Si et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024; Xiao et al.,\n2024). Together, these developments raise an exciting research question: How can LLMs go beyond conversational\ninterfaces to enable adaptive, goal-driven interactions that meaningfully serve human needs?\nIn this work, we introduce Generative Interfaces, a new paradigm that differs from conversational UIs. Rather\nthan delivering static text responses within a predefined chatbot window, Generative Interfaces dynamically create\nentirely new interface structures that adapt to users\u2019 specific goals and interaction requirements. While recent tools like\nOpenAI\u2019s Canvas and Claude\u2019s Artifacts enhance user interaction by providing dedicated workspaces for documents,\ncode, and visualizations, our approach extends this vision by supporting deeper engagement and enabling richer, task-\nspecific experiences. For example, as shown in Figure 1, when users pose questions such as \u201cI want to understand\nneural networks\u201d or \u201cHow can I learn piano effectively?\u201d, conversational interfaces typically return long blocks of\ntext. In contrast, Generative Interfaces transform these queries into an interactive neural network animation or a\npiano practice tool that offers real-time feedback. This paradigm shift presents two key challenges: (1) building the\ninfrastructure to generate user interfaces on the fly in response to users\u2019 queries, and (2) rigorously evaluating whether\nsuch generated interfaces actually improve user experience.\nTo address the first challenge, our framework introduces a structured interface-specific representation coupled with\nan iterative refinement procedure. The structured representation enables more controllable and interpretable gen-\neration by explicitly modeling high-level interaction flows, interface state transitions, and component dependencies,\nwhich we formalize using finite state machines (Shehady & Siewiorek, 1997; Wagner et al., 2006). The iterative re-\nfinement procedure further enhances output quality by prompting LLMs to generate query-specific evaluation rubrics\nand repeatedly refine interface candidates through generation-evaluation cycles until the system converges on a pol-\nished, context-appropriate solution. To address the second challenge, we establish a systematic evaluation framework\n\u2217Equal contribution.\n1\narXiv:2508.19227v1  [cs.CL]  26 Aug 2025\n\nPreprint\nHow can I learn piano e\ufb00ectively?\nLearning piano \ne\ufb00ectively \ninvolves several \nkey strategies that \nwork together to \nbuild your skills \nsystematically.\nStart with proper \nAsk Anything ...\nSEND\nConversational\nGenerative\nI want to analyze three years of customer purchase \ndata  for an e-commerce business that sells ... ...\nDrag and drop your CSV \nor Excel file here\nSelect File\nChart Type\nLine Chart\n>\n>\nSegment By\nMonth\nCustomer Segment\nAll\n>\nAug\nFirst-time Buyers:1080\nRepeat Cutormers:980\nSEND\nUpload data and Click.\n(b) Introducing Interactive Experiences\n(c) Multistep task execution\nTime\nI'd be happy to \nhelp you analyze \nyour e-commerce \ncustomer \npurchase data! \nThis type of \nanalysis can \nprovide valuable \nAsk Anything ...\nSEND\nAsk Anything ...\nSEND\nL\nInteractive Practice Tools\nEnhance your learning with these interactive tools\nPlay Demo Melody\nTwinkle Little Star\nOde to Joy\nF\u00fcr Elise (Intro)\nJingle Bells\nPachelbel's Canon\nTry These Famous Melodies\nAsk Anything ...\nSEND\nConversational\nGenerative\nExplain neural network.\n0.0\nHidden Layer 1 - Neuron 2 \nValue: 0.00\nForward\nS\nInput\nA\nReset\nSpeed\nR\nIntroduction to Neural Networks\nNeural networks are computer systems inspired by \nhow the human brain processes information.

(a) Conceptual framework showing how\nGenerative Interfaces create structured, interactive experiences rather than static text responses, evaluated along func-\ntional, interactive, and emotional dimensions. (b\u2013c) Example queries illustrate how Generative Interfaces transform\nuser input into adaptive tools\u2014such as interactive learning aids or multistep workflows\u2014providing clearer organiza-\ntion and richer interactivity than conversational responses.\nfor assessing language model interfaces across three key dimensions: functionality, interactivity, and emotional per-\nception (Hartmann et al., 2008; Nielsen et al., 2012; Duan, 2025). Specifically, we construct a diverse prompt suite,\nUser Interface eXperience (UIX), that strategically covers diverse domains and prompt types to reflect real-world us-\nage scenarios (Tamkin et al., 2024). For each user query, we recruit experienced annotators to interact with different\ninterfaces and conduct pairwise comparisons. This comprehensive evaluation not only demonstrates the superior per-\nformance of generative interfaces but also reveals when they excel (in structured and information-dense domains) and\nwhy users prefer them (through enhanced visual organization, interactivity, and reduced cognitive load).\nOur main contributions are as follows:\n\u2022 We propose Generative Interfaces, a paradigm that enables adaptive, goal-driven interactions with LLMs\nby dynamically generating user interfaces.\n\u2022 We develop a technical infrastructure with structured representations and iterative refinement, and an evalua-\ntion framework that systematically compares generative and conversational interfaces.\n\u2022 We demonstrate that generative interfaces significantly outperform conversational ones across diverse query\ntypes and interaction patterns.\n2\nGENERATIVE INTERFACE FOR LANGUAGE MODELS\nWe begin by introducing the structured interface-specific representation (Sec.2.1). Next, we outline the generation\npipeline: user queries are first mapped into intermediate representations and then decoded into UI code (Sec.2.2).\nFinally, we describe the iterative refinement process that applies adaptive reward functions to further optimize the\ngenerated interfaces (Sec. 2.3).\n2\n\n\n\nFr.\u2019\ngd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+ fe\n\npe Functional Perception\n\nInteractive Perception\n\nhy Emotional Perception\n\n\n\nInteractive Practice Tools\n\nTry These Famous Melodies\n\n\n00\n\n00\n\n00\n\n0.0\n\noo\n\n00\n\n00\n\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreprint\nI want to understand \nquantum physics \nprinciples.\nOpen Home\nView\nExplore Tutorials\nRun Simulation Glossary Lookup\nisTutorialModalOpen \n= false\nisTutorialModalOpen \n= true\nisSimulationModalOpen \n= true\nhoverOnTerm \n= true\ncurrentSimulation \n!= null\nisHelpModalOpen \n= true\nonClickConceptsNav\nonClickSimulationsNav\nonHoverGlossaryTerm\nonSelectSimulation\nonCloseSimulationModal\nonCloseHelpModal\n  <title>Quantum Physics Explorer</title>\n  <script src=\"https://cdn.tail-\nwindcss.com\"></script>\n</head>\n<body class=\"bg-gray-50 text-gray-800\">\n  <div class=\"p-8\">\n    <!-- Core Quantum Concepts -->\n    <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-blue-800 \nmb-4\">Core Quantum Concepts</h2>\n    <div class=\"grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 \nlg:grid-cols-4 gap-4 mb-8\">\n      \n      <div class=\"bg-white border-l-4 bor-\nder-blue-600 shadow-sm rounded-lg p-4 flex \nflex-col\">\n        <h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold \ntext-blue-800 mb-2\">Wave-Particle Duality</h3>\n        <p class=\"text-sm text-gray-700 flex-1\">\nCore Quantum Concepts\nWave-Particle Duality\nUncertainty Principle\nThe concept that every \nparticle or quantum entity \nexhibits both wave and \nparticle properties.

This structured representation\nguides the generation of (c) functional code and user interfaces. The system employs (d) iterative refinement with (e)\nadaptive reward functions containing query-specific evaluation rubrics.\n2.1\nSTRUCTURED INTERFACE-SPECIFIC REPRESENTATION\nDirectly generating interfaces is challenging due to the vast search space and the complexity of interactive contexts.\nTo address this, we translate user queries into a structured interface-specific representation that anchors and guides\nthe generation process. This representation operates at two complementary levels: (i) high-level interaction flows\nthat capture user trajectories and task phases, and (ii) low-level finite state machines (FSMs) that define component\nbehaviors and UI logic.\nInteraction flows The high-level interaction flow provides a symbolic abstraction of user behavior across primary\ninterface stages. It represents user task progression as a directed graph, where transitions are triggered by UI events\nsuch as clicking. We denote this abstraction as a directed graph G = (V, T ), where nodes V represent interface views\nor subgoals, and edges T denote possible transitions (See Appendix C for detail definition). In the example shown\nin Figure 2, the natural language query I want to understand quantum physics principles\u201d is grounded into a coher-\nent interaction trajectory: Open Home View \u2192Explore Tutorials\u2192Run Simulation\u2192Glossary\nLookup\u201d. This abstraction captures the high-level intent and interaction logic of potential users, while concrete UI\nbehaviors (e.g., state toggles and modal updates) are specified separately in the FSM.\nFinite state machines We further use Finite State Machines (FSMs) to describe how individual UI modules respond\nto user actions and update their states accordingly. Formally, we model each UI component as M = (S, E, \u03b4, s0),\nwhere S is the set of atomic interface states (e.g., isModalOpen=true), E is the set of user-triggered events (e.g.,\nclick, hover), \u03b4 is the state transition function, and s0 is the initial state (See Appendix C). This structure explicitly\ndefines how the interface should behave given a particular state and a triggered event.\n2.2\nGENERATION PIPELINE\nRequirement specification First, we generate a requirement specification for the user query, capturing the main goal,\ndesired features, UI components, interaction styles, and problem-solving strategies. This specification serves as a\nbridge between the user\u2019s natural language intent and formal interface design.\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreprint\nStructured representation generation Second, we generate a structured interface-specific representation (Sec. 2.1)\nbased on the requirement specification. This representation serves as a modular and interpretable scaffold for UI\ngeneration, where the hierarchy of interaction flows and finite state machines ensures that the resulting interfaces are\nboth coherent and functional.\nUI generation To support the UI generation based on structured representations, we build a complementary codebase\ncontaining reusable implementations of common UI elements (e.g., clock, map, calculator, video player, code viewer,\nand chart). Additionally, a web retrieval module1 gathers relevant UI examples and data sources. Finally, the entire\ncontext, including the natural language query, requirement specification, structured representation, predefined compo-\nnents, and retrieved content examples, is passed to an LLM to synthesize executable HTML/CSS/JS code, which is\nrendered into an interface, as illustrated in Figure 2 (a)(b)(c).\n2.3\nITERATIVE UI REFINEMENT\nGenerating an effective and well-structured user interface is usually an iterative process (Li et al., 2024). To this\nend, we introduce an adaptive, reward-driven iterative refinement procedure that progressively improves UI quality by\ngenerating evaluation metrics, scoring candidates, and regenerating interfaces through multiple cycles.\nAdaptive reward function To support task-specific and context-aware evaluation, we employ an LLM to construct\na reward function tailored to each user query adaptively. As shown in Figure 2(e), for query \u201cI want to understand\nquantum physics principles,\u201d the system automatically generates a set of fine-grained evaluation metrics\u2014such as\nVisual Structure, Explain Physics Concept, and Clarity\u2014each with associated weights and verification rules. These\ndimensions are scored independently and aggregated to compute the final overall score, which ranges from 0 to 100.\nSee Appendix D for examples of adaptive reward functions.\nIterative refinement As depicted in Figure 2(d), at each iteration, multiple UI candidates are generated, then the\nadaptive reward function evaluates these candidates. In the next iteration, we will regenerate the UI using the highest-\nscoring candidate from the previous iteration, along with its evaluation. This feedback loop guides the LLM to address\nissues related to structure, semantics, or visual design. The process continues until a candidate reaches an overall score\nof 90 or higher, or until we have completed five iterations.\n3\nEVALUATION FRAMEWORK\nTo enable systematic evaluation, we developed a comprehensive evaluation framework, which includes a diverse user\nquery suite named User Interface eXperience (UIX), covering various scenarios, styles, and intents (Sec. 3.1); a set of\nmultidimensional evaluation metrics (Sec. 3.2); and an integrated human study (Sec. 3.3).\n3.1\nUSER QUERIES\nIn UIX, we generate a test set of 100 user queries using Claude 3.7 that spans multiple domains, supporting varying\nspecificity levels and capturing different query complexities. Specifically, we follow best practices from prior work\naround how people engage with LLMs as follows. (I) Topic coverage: Prompts are uniformly distributed across the ten\ndomains defined in Clio (Tamkin et al., 2024), covering a wide range of real-world user scenarios. See Appendix A for\ncategory list. (II) Query detail level: Following Cao et al. (2025), each domain contains an equal split of concise and\ndetailed prompts. Concise prompts express intent abstractly in fewer than 15 words (e.g., \u201cCreate a SWOT analysis for\nmy small business\u201d), while detailed prompts provide explicit goals and rich context. (III) Query Type: As user queries\nshift from casual dialogue to actionable tasks, our design maintains a balanced mixture between general conversational\nprompts (e.g., \u201cHow can I improve my public speaking?\u201d) and interactive, task-oriented queries (e.g., \u201cI want to\nvisualize my company\u2019s sales data\u201d).\n3.2\nEVALUATION METRICS\nTo assess the quality of LLM interfaces, we adopt a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics adapted from Nielsen\net al. (2012) and Hartmann et al. (2008), capturing three core dimensions of user perception: functional, interactive,\nand emotional. Functional Perception includes Query-Interface Consistency (QIC), which evaluates how well the\ngenerated interface aligns with and fulfills the user\u2019s query intent (Duan, 2025), and Task Efficiency (TaskEff), which\nmeasures how efficiently users can achieve their goals with minimal effort or time (Nielsen et al., 2012; Duan, 2025).\n1We use exa.ai as the search API.\n4\n\nPreprint\nFramework\nStatus\nFunctional\nInteractive\nEmotional Overall\nQIC TaskEff Usability Learnability\nIC\nASA IES\nConvUI (Claude 3.7) vs. GenUI\nConvUI 11%\n14%\n13%\n10%\n9%\n3%\n6%\n12%\nTie\n6%\n5%\n4%\n6%\n6%\n8%\n7%\n4%\nGenUI 83%\n81%\n83%\n84%\n85% 89% 87%\n84%\nConvUI (GPT-4o) vs. GenUI\nConvUI 32%\n41%\n28%\n35%\n38% 13% 24%\n30%\nTie\n11%\n5%\n7%\n10%\n8%\n7%\n6%\n1%\nGenUI 57%\n54%\n65%\n55%\n54% 80% 70%\n69%\nIUI vs. GenUI\nIUI\n13%\n17%\n16%\n14%\n16% 20% 14%\n17%\nTie\n18%\n13%\n18%\n20%\n15%\n5%\n15%\n8%\nGenUI 69%\n70%\n66%\n66%\n69% 75% 71%\n75%\nTable 1: Human Evaluation of UI Framework. Win, tie and loss percentages of UI variants compared to our system\n(GenUI), based on human preference across different perception dimensions: functional, interactive, and emotional.\nInteractive Perception comprises Usability, assessing interface clarity and actionable structure (Hartmann et al., 2008;\nNielsen et al., 2012); Learnability, indicating how easily new users can begin using the interface without prior experi-\nence (Nielsen et al., 2012); and Information Clarity (IC), which evaluates information organization, readability, and\ninterpretability (Hartmann et al., 2008; Cao et al., 2025). Finally, Emotional Perception covers Aesthetic or Stylistic\nAppeal (ASA), reflecting the visual consistency and attractiveness of the design (Hartmann et al., 2008; Duan et al.,\n2024), and Interaction Experience Satisfaction (IES), capturing the user\u2019s overall satisfaction and engagement with\nthe interface (Duan, 2025). This enables a comprehensive assessment of user experience by tracing the full perceptual\nprocess\u2014\u201chow users understand the interface\u201d \u2192\u201chow they operate it\u201d \u2192\u201chow they emotionally respond\u201d. Instead\nof using the traditional Likert scale, we adopt a pairwise comparison approach, following Zheng et al. (2023); Si et al.\n(2024). That is, for each query, we present two interfaces to human annotators and ask for their preferences on all\nseven dimensions, as well as their overall preferences.\n3.3\nHUMAN EVALUATION\nFor pairwise comparison, we collected human judgments on Prolific 2 (Annotators are paid at the rate of $16/hour,\nsee Appendix G for annotator demographics). Each evaluation instance consisted of a user query and two UI outputs\n(Example 1 and Example 2) generated by different methods. Annotators judged which output better satisfied the\ncriteria across seven evaluation dimensions and overall (Example 1 wins, Example 2 wins, or Tie). We aggregated the\nthree judgments per instance using majority voting to obtain a single final decision. Despite the inherent subjectivity of\ninterface assessments, Fleiss\u2019 Kappa (Landis & Koch, 1977) reached 0.525, indicating a moderate level of agreement.\n4\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nImplementation details Our system is built on OpenCanvas3 and uses Claude 3.7 (Anthropic, 2025) as the default\nbackbone LLM, given its strong performance in UI code generation (Si et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024). We refer to our\napproach as GenUI and compare it against two baselines: (I) Conversational UI (ConvUI): A traditional chat interface\nusing either GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024) or Claude 3.7 (Anthropic, 2025). To reduce potential bias in human evaluation,\nwe present a unified chat interface without disclosing the underlying model. For Claude 3.7, 26% of responses include\nartifact generation. We remove the artifacts and retain only the textual output to ensure a clean and fair comparison\nwith other conversational systems. (II) Instructed UI (IUI): An interface generated by Claude 3.7 when explicitly\nprompted (query + \u201cPlease help me solve it with UI\u201d). This prompt consistently triggers artifact generation, and the\nresulting artifact is taken as the system output.\n4.1\nMAIN RESULTS AND FINDINGS\nConversational Interfaces vs. Generative Interfaces As shown in Table 1, GenUI consistently outperforms ConvUI\nacross all evaluation dimensions. Interestingly, ConvUI (GPT-4o) performs more competitively than ConvUI (Claude\n3.7), suggesting that well-structured textual responses can still be effective in specific scenarios. Compared to ConvUI\n2https://app.prolific.com\n3https://github.com/langchain-ai/open-canvas\n5\n\nPreprint\nFigure 3: Human preference across 10 query topics (Tamkin et al., 2024).\n(Claude 3.7), GenUI achieves the most significant gains in ASA (+86.0%) and IES (+81.0%). Overall, its emotional\nappeal and interactive functionality are the primary drivers of its superior performance, resulting in an 84.0% win rate\nover ConvUI (Claude 3.7). These findings suggest that users clearly prefer GenUI for most queries.\nUser comments further support this finding. For example, one noted: \u201cConvUI is a little confusing in the presentation.\nGenUI provides the requested information in an easy-to-understand manner, laying out everything requested and\nanticipating what else may be needed.\u201d This suggests that structured output and proactive interaction are key reasons\nwhy users prefer GenUI. A small number of users did express a preference for the familiarity of traditional ConvUIs,\nas one remarked (see interface examples in Appendix Figure 7): \u201cChatbot interface is most people know already,\nwhile GenUI is a somewhat complex and unfamiliar app.\u201d This counterpoint highlights a residual inertia in user\ncomfort with familiar formats. However, such preference did not override the broader recognition of GenUI\u2019s objective\nadvantages, indicating strong potential for user adaptation and adoption in real-world deployments.\nWhat domains benefit from Generative Interfaces? As shown in Figure 3, preferences for GenUI vary by domain.\nUsers strongly favored GenUI in Data Analysis & Visualization (93.8%) and Business Strategy & Operations (87.5%),\nwhere tasks typically involve interpreting large amounts of structured information. By contrast, in Advanced AI/ML\nApplications, GenUI received 50.0% of preferences, suggesting that traditional linear text explanations remain effec-\ntive in math-heavy contexts. Overall, these results indicate that domains characterized by complex information benefit\nmost from GenUIs, whereas ConvUIs are still suitable for domains that rely on straightforward explanations.\nWhat queries benefit from Generative Interfaces? As shown in Figure 4a, GenUI receives stronger preferences\nfor certain query characteristics. It is particularly favored in interactive tasks (80.0%), underscoring the advantages of\ngenerative interfaces in scenarios where interaction is essential for task completion. In general conversations, users\nalso show a clear preference for GenUI over ConvUI (73.0% vs. 23.0%). When comparing query detail level, GenUI\nis preferred more for detailed queries (80.0%) than for concise ones (73.0%), likely because simple conversational\nresponses sometimes sufficiently address short queries, whereas GenUI may introduce unnecessary complexity.\n4.2\nABLATION STUDY\nOur Pipeline vs. Direct Instruct We compare our framework against IUI: directly instructing Claude 3.7 to generate\na web interface with the artifact feature enabled, representing a highly engineered baseline. Our system outperforms\nthis strong baseline, achieving a 58.0% higher win rate (Table 1). Among the baselines, IUI shows better performance\nin emotional perception dimensions such as ASA, but it still lags behind GenUI overall.\nNatural Language vs. Structured Representation The natural language version provides a descriptive explanation\nof the UI based on the user query, without employing structured representations to define interface states formally.

The control group is the full GenUI framework (adaptive reward, iterative generation, and\nstructured representation). All ablations are compared against this full version, where \u201cLoss\u201d indicates that GenUI\noutperforms the variant. Note that \u201cStatic\u201d refers to static reward design, \u201cOne-shot\u201d denotes generation without\nrefinement, and \u201cNatural\u201d indicates natural language representations.\nOne-shot Generation vs. Iterative Refinement As shown in Table 2 (Row 2 vs. Row 3), the iterative refinement\nprocess yields consistent improvements on human preference across all perception dimensions, resulting in a notable\n+14.0% overall win rate improvement compared to one-shot generation. Figure 4b further illustrates that each re-\nfinement round leads to a clear performance boost, with average LLM-based reward scores increasing by +1.2% and\n+4.9%, respectively. Additionally, the gap between the maximum and minimum scores narrows progressively, indi-\ncating improved stability and convergence through iterative optimization. We illustrate an example of such iterative\nimprovement in Appendix Figure 8, where each iteration incrementally enhances layout efficiency, usability, and user\nguidance, ultimately leading to a more informative and user-friendly interface through structured refinement.\nReward Function: Static vs. Adaptive Table 2 (Row 3) highlights the effect of dynamic reward functions, which\ndiffer from the full version only by replacing adaptive scoring with a static baseline. The absence of dynamic rewards\nresults in a 17.0% drop in overall win rate, with performance declining across all seven evaluation metrics. This\ncomparison highlights the importance of dynamically adjusting evaluation criteria to capture the complex user goals\nand task-specific requirements inherent in each query, rather than relying on generic, fixed heuristics.\n4.3\nHUMAN PREFERENCE ANALYSIS\nTo better understand the factors underlying human annotator preferences, we collected fine-grained textual justifica-\ntions for each perception dimension in 40% of the pairwise comparisons, and overall comments for the remaining\n60%. Following the methodology of Lam et al. (2024), we used Claude 3.7 to systematically extract high-level se-\n7\n\nDetail level\n\nDetailed; 20.0% 80.0%\nConcise! 22.0% 13.0%\nO 20 40 60 310) 100\nQuery type\nGeneral; 23.0% 13.0%\nInteractive; 19.0% 80.0%\n\nO 20 40 60 310) 100\nPercentage (%)\n\nConvul Tie Genul\n\n95.0\n\n92.5\n\n90.0\n\n\u00a9\n~\nuw\n\nReward value\ns 8\nul lo)\n\nfoe)\nS\nfo)\n\n77.5\n\n75.0\n\n91.33\n88.78\n88.33\n87.22\n+4.89\n86.67\n+1.22\n83.89\n82.67\n79.67\n78.00\nIteration 1 Iteration 2 Iteration 3\n\nIteration\n\n\nPreprint\nFigure 5: Human comment distribution.

(b) For\neach concept in (a), the chart shows the percentage of users who preferred GenUIs or ConvUIs.\nmantic concepts from these qualitative responses. The resulting comments were then clustered into semantic themes\nidentified by the LLM (Figure 5). This analysis allows us to pinpoint the key factors shaping user preferences beyond\nsurface-level considerations such as visual aesthetics and engagement. Finally, we computed preference distributions\nbetween generative and conversational interfaces within each identified semantic dimension.\nCognitive Offloading as Deeper Preference Driver Cognitive offloading (Risko & Gilbert, 2016) emerges through\nuser comments as a subtler yet deeper driver. 78.5% of users mentioning Cognitive Load & Intuition preferred GenUI.\nFor instance, in designing a continuing education program for healthcare professionals, a user noted: \u201cThis type of\ninformation analysis is very complex ...GenUI helps to break down the categories into manageable steps ...makes\nthe complex information easier to process.\u201d This illustrates how GenUI\u2019s interface acts as an external cognitive aid to\nbreak down information. However, in easier scenarios such as designing a high-school mathematics curriculum, Con-\nvUI was preferred because it \u201cclearly and informatively illustrates the steps\u201d. In summary, GenUI excels in complex,\nconcept-heavy scenarios where cognitive offloading facilitates understanding. In contrast, ConvUI outperforms for\neasy and basic \u201chow-to\u201d queries where additional tools impose unnecessary cognitive load.\nVisual Structure Enhances Perceived Usability and Trust Among the user comments related to the \u201cPerceived\nCredibility & Professionalism\u201d dimension, 86.5% preferred the GenUI. Users consistently described GenUI as more\nauthoritative, credible, and professional. For example, in response to the query \u201cHow do I conduct market research?\u201d,\nusers commented: \u201cGenUI is more professionally written\u201d, \u201cIt offers out the more sound advice\u201d, and \u201cIt is the better\ndiscernment.\u201d Notably, this perception of professionalism does not stem solely from the content itself. In fact, many\nusers acknowledged that both interfaces provided reasonable answers to the query (e.g., \u201cBoth answer the prompt\nreasonably well\u201d). What sets GenUI apart is its presentation: through modular layouts, clear hierarchies, visual\nanchors, and polished formatting, it delivers the information in a more organized manner.\n5\nRELATED WORK\nContext-Aware and Adaptive Interface Context-aware interfaces have been widely explored since the rise of ubiq-\nuitous computing, aiming to improve usability, reduce cognitive load, and better support user goals (Dey et al., 2000;\nHorvitz, 1999; Theng & Duh, 2008). As computing systems have become more complex and pervasive, the ability to\nadjust interfaces dynamically has been critical for creating more effective and accessible user experiences (Gajos &\nWeld, 2004; Gajos et al., 2007; Nichols et al., 2002; 2006a;b). Prior systems often adapted functionality through a fi-\nnite set of predefined states. While effective in constrained settings, these approaches faced challenges with scalability\n8\n\nHigh-level concepts Preference distribution\n\nVisual Aesthetics & Engagement 23.4% |16.7%\n\nInformation Organization & Accessibility\n\nCognitive Load & Intuition 21.5%\n\nActionability & Practical Utility 18.2%\n\n17.5%\n\nInformation Richness & Comprehensiveness\n\nGuidance & Learning Support 25.5%\n\n41.0%\n\nContent Relevance & Efficiency\n\nInteractive Experience Quality\n\nPerceived Credibility & Professionalism\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 O 20 40 60 80 100\nPercentage (%) Percentage (%)\n\nConvul ~~ Genul\n\nPreprint\nand sometimes reduced predictability and user control (Findlater & Gajos, 2009). Recent advances in LLMs have en-\nabled new forms of adaptive interfaces that dynamically generate interface elements in response to user prompts (Wu\net al., 2022; Dibia, 2023; Cha et al., 2024; Cheng et al., 2024; Nandy et al., 2024). These approaches mark a shift from\nstatic outputs toward model-driven, interactive systems.\nTo improve interaction efficiency between humans and LLMs, prior studies (Jiang et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2024; Ross\net al., 2023) have proposed combining text-based ConvUIs with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). For example,\nOpenAI Canvas enables users to directly edit documents and code on a canvas, avoiding repeated prompt inputs;\nGraphologue (Jiang et al., 2023) transforms lengthy and complex LLM responses into graphical diagrams to support\ninformation exploration and question answering. However, although these approaches leverage LLMs to generate\ndisplayed content, the UIs they employ are predesigned. In contrast, GenerativeGUI (Hojo et al., 2025) explores the\nusability of dynamically generated interfaces in clarifying question (CQ) interactions. ClarifyGPT (Mu et al., 2023)\nalso introduces CQs, but in the narrower domain of code generation. Beyond CQ scenarios, DynaVis (Vaithilingam\net al., 2024) proposes a system that combines natural language with dynamically synthesized UI widgets to support\nchart editing tasks, without exploring broader, general-purpose scenarios. Unlike prior systems that modify fixed UI\ncomponents (Cao et al., 2025), our framework generates complete interfaces customized to diverse user queries.\nAutomatic UI Generation This direction has evolved from early computer vision approaches utilizing OCR and\nedge detection for reverse engineering mobile interfaces (Nguyen & Csallner, 2015) to neural network-based end-\nto-end synthesis systems (Beltramelli, 2018; Robinson, 2019; As\u00b8\u0131ro\u02d8glu et al., 2019), though limited by model ca-\npacity and training data. Recent advances in LLMs have substantially improved UI generation capabilities through\ndirectly prompting LLMs with natural language descriptions (Laurenc\u00b8on et al., 2024), screenshots (Si et al., 2024),\nand sketches (Li et al., 2024) and iterative refinement via LLM-generated feedback (Li et al., 2024). Our work di-\nverges from these paradigms by establishing direct query-to-interface mapping and requiring no UI specifications\nfrom users. More fine-grained control of the UI code generation process encompasses diverse intermediate represen-\ntation approaches: (I) graph-based representation to capture hierarchical relationships and dependencies between UI\nelements (Jiang et al., 2024), (II) UI grammar (Kong et al., 2008) to help LLMs for more intuitive and precise layout\ndescription (Lu et al., 2023), and (III) data schema-driven UI specification synthesis to guide subsequent generation\nprocesses (Cao et al., 2025). Similarly, our framework employs interaction flows and finite state machines to model\nthe reaction to user actions and the evolution of interfaces.\n6\nCONCLUSION\nWe introduce Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm in which LLMs proactively generate adaptive,\ninteractive interfaces to better support complex user goals. Our evaluation demonstrates clear advantages over tradi-\ntional conversational approaches, particularly in structured and information-dense tasks. The findings further clarify\nwhen generative interfaces are most effective and when conversational formats remain competitive. Future directions\ninclude integrating multimodal input, domain-specific templates, and collaborative multi-user environments.\nLimitations First, the system only supports HTML/JavaScript frontends without backend logic, which restricts the\ncomplexity of generated interfaces. As tasks grow more complex, more expressive representations beyond interaction\nflows and finite state machines may be needed. Second, the iterative refinement process introduces latency of up to\nseveral minutes, which may be undesirable in real-time settings. Advances in model efficiency and infrastructure could\nhelp mitigate this issue. Third, the system generates interfaces for all queries, even when interaction is unnecessary.\nFuture work could incorporate a classifier to determine whether an input requires interaction in context and selectively\ninvoke the generative UI system. Finally, our evaluation is based on controlled benchmarks rather than open-ended\nuser studies (Chiang et al., 2024), leaving open the question of how generative UIs perform in real-world usage.\nREFERENCES\nAnthropic.\nIntroducing\nclaude\n3.7\nsonnet,\n2025.\nURL\nhttps://www.anthropic.com/news/\nclaude-3-7-sonnet.\nApple Inc.\nKnowledge navigator, 1987.\nURL https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_\nNavigator.

Automatic assessment (0\u2013100 scale) of UI\nframeworks across functional, interactive, and emotional perception categories.\nUser-centered evaluation remains the gold standard for UI assessment due to interfaces\u2019 fundamental purpose of facil-\nitating human interaction and operation (Hartmann et al., 2008; Duan, 2025; Cao et al., 2025). However, generative\ninterfaces requiring real-time synthesis and rapid iterative refinement cannot depend on user feedback, necessitating\nrobust automatic evaluation frameworks.\nEarly approaches employed manually crafted behavioral prediction metrics (Lee et al., 2020), though these methods\ndemonstrated limited generalizability and required substantial domain expertise. Recent research has increasingly\nleveraged LLMs for UI assessment, with Duan et al. (2024) employing LLMs to generate design feedback and qual-\nity ratings with bounding box annotations. Jeon et al. (2025) extends this paradigm to persuasiveness evaluation,\nachieving meaningful correlation with empirical A/B testing outcomes. In this work, we ask LLMs to judge the same\ndimensions that we ask human annotators, including some previously human-exclusive metrics such as task efficiency\nand learnability.\nSpecifically, we use a listwise ranker (Liu et al., 2023) to evaluate different interface variants of the same user query by\npresenting the LLM (Claude 3.7) with UI codes and screenshots, where the LLM assigns scores ranging from 0 to 100\nfor each evaluation dimension. We compare LLM evaluation scores with pairwise annotations from humans, which\nyields an agreement rate of 69.0%. While it suggests LLM as a reliable proxy for convenient and scalable evaluations,\nwe also observe common issues like length bias (Dubois et al., 2024) which might favor GenUI.\nC\nREPRESENTATION: NATURAL LANGUAGE vs. STRUCTURED\nTo present a more fine-grained comparison, we showcase two distinct representations of the same user intent. The user\nprompt used here is:\n\u201cI want to understand quantum physics principles.\u201d\nA natural language representation includes the goal, salient features, technical requirements, and user preferences,\nwhich are expressed through multiple descriptive fields.

Each annotation task contained 8 UI comparison questions. In some questionnaires, we\nembedded trap questions in which the \u201cUI\u201d was not a real interface with components, but rather a simple\ninstruction such as \u201cSelect Example A for all options\u201d or \u201cSelect Example B for all options.\u201d Annotators who\nfailed to follow these explicit instructions were identified as inattentive, and their entire submissions were\ndiscarded.\n\u2022 Consistency Check. We manually compared each annotator\u2019s multiple-choice selections with their accom-\npanying textual comments. If a comment stated that Example A was better but the selected option was B, we\nconsidered this a clear inconsistency indicative of random selection. Such annotations were removed.\n\u2022 Manual Review. We conducted a manual review for annotators who had low agreement with other annotators\nand determined whether the annotator\u2019s responses showed signs of random or careless selection. If so, all\nresponses from that annotator were excluded.\nThrough this process, we ensured that the retained annotations were both attentive and internally consistent, thereby\nimproving the overall quality of our evaluation.\n19\n\nConducting Effective Market Research\n\n\u00a9 You 5/1/2025, 2:03:15 AM\n\nHow do | conduct market research?\n\na) Assistant 5/1/2025, 2:03:28 AM\n\nHow to Conduct Market Research\n\nMarket research is the process of gathering and analyzing information about a market, including cus-\ntomers, competitors, and industry trends.

  "pdfs/2508.19221v1.pdf": "Evaluating the Evaluators:\nAre readability metrics good measures of readability?\nIsabel Cachola, Daniel Khashabi\u2217and Mark Dredze\u2217\nJohns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21211\n{icachola, danielk, mdredze}@cs.jhu.edu\nAbstract\nPlain Language Summarization (PLS) aims to\ndistill complex documents into accessible sum-\nmaries for non-expert audiences. In this pa-\nper, we conduct a thorough survey of PLS\nliterature, and identify that the current stan-\ndard practice for readability evaluation is to use\ntraditional readability metrics, such as Flesch-\nKincaid Grade Level (FKGL). However, de-\nspite proven utility in other fields, these met-\nrics have not been compared to human read-\nability judgments in PLS. We evaluate 8 read-\nability metrics and show that most correlate\npoorly with human judgments, including the\nmost popular metric, FKGL. We then show\nthat Language Models (LMs) are better judges\nof readability, with the best-performing model\nachieving a Pearson correlation of 0.56 with\nhuman judgments. Extending our analysis to\nPLS datasets, which contain summaries aimed\nat non-expert audiences, we find that LMs bet-\nter capture deeper measures of readability, such\nas required background knowledge, and lead to\ndifferent conclusions than the traditional met-\nrics. Based on these findings, we offer recom-\nmendations for best practices in the evaluation\nof plain language summaries. We release our\nanalysis code and survey data.\n\u00a7 JHU-CLSP/eval-the-eval-readability\n1\nIntroduction\nIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP),\nplain language summarization (PLS) distills com-\nplex documents, such as scientific articles, into ac-\ncessible summaries for non-expert audiences while\npreserving essential meaning (Chandrasekaran\net al., 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted\nthe critical need to make scientific knowledge ac-\ncessible to the general public (Wang et al., 2020).\nBy enhancing public engagement with research,\n\u2217Equal advising.\nPLS can help bridge the gap between expert knowl-\nedge and general understanding.\nAlthough human evaluation remains the gold\nstandard for assessing summary quality and read-\nability, the high cost and slow turnaround (Liu et al.,\n2022) have led many researchers to rely on auto-\nmatic evaluation metrics for evaluating PLS sum-\nmaries (Goldsack et al., 2022; Guo et al., 2021). Al-\nthough these metrics have been validated in fields\nsuch as education and law (Thorndike, 1936; Han\net al., 2024), their effectiveness in reflecting read-\nability in the context of PLS remains unproven.\nAre automated readability metrics appropriate\nevaluators for the task of PLS? We explore whether\nthe definition of readability as implemented by au-\ntomated measures matches the definition used by\nthe PLS research community. Additionally, given\nthat Language Models (LMs) can reason over com-\nplex language tasks (Brown et al., 2020; Wei et al.,\n2022; Yang et al., 2024), we explore whether LMs\ncan judge the readability of a summary. Given\nthese motivations, we ask the following research\nquestions (RQs).\nRQ1 What is the current standard of evalua-\ntion in PLS literature?\nWe review PLS literature\nby collecting relevant papers published in *ACL\nvenues from 2013 to 2025 and note the readability\nevaluation method used in the study. We find that\nthe majority of papers focus on a small number\nof traditional readability metrics, such as Flesch-\nKincaid grade Level (FKGL) (Flesch, 1952). This\nfinding motivates our analysis of the suitability of\ntraditional readability metrics for PLS evaluation.\nRQ2 How well do traditional readability met-\nrics correlate with human readability judg-\nments?\nSince the PLS research community em-\nploys these traditional metrics (RQ1), we assess\ntheir suitability by measuring their correlation with\nhuman readability judgments. A low correlation\nwould suggest that a metric is inadequate for eval-\n1\narXiv:2508.19221v1  [cs.CL]  26 Aug 2025\n\nuating PLS readability, and would necessitate the\nPLS research community identify and move to bet-\nter metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this\nwork is the first to compare traditional readability\nmetrics to human readability judgments for PLS.\nRQ3 How well do LM-based evaluators corre-\nlate with human readability judgments?\nTra-\nditional readability metrics primarily use lexical\nfeatures, such as the number of syllables in a word,\nto measure readability. In contrast, LMs may cap-\nture more complex attributes of readability than\ntraditional metrics, such as the inclusion of neces-\nsary context and explanation of key concepts. The\nfindings of this research question have important\nimplications for both the best practices in evalu-\nation of PLS and the broader NLP community\u2019s\nunderstanding of LM capabilities.\nRQ4\nWhat do LM-based evaluators reveal\nabout the readability of popular summarization\ndatasets?\nResearchers often rely on traditional\nreadability metrics when assessing summaries in\nnew methods or datasets. However, if these met-\nrics correlate poorly with human judgments, the\nresulting conclusions may be flawed. Similarly,\nexisting datasets, which often arise from data of\nconvenience, may be poorly suited to PLS research.\nThis RQ explores what LM-based evaluators re-\nveal about the readability of popular summariza-\ntion datasets and how LM-based conclusions differ\nfrom those based on traditional readability metrics.\nWe answer these questions through the follow-\ning contributions. First, we survey PLS papers\npublished in *ACL venues and find that the most\npopular metric for readability evaluation is Flesch-\nKincaid Grade Level (FKGL) (Flesch, 1952). Mo-\ntivated by these findings, we then compare 8 tradi-\ntional readability metrics to human judgments. We\nshow that 6 of the 8 metrics have a poor correla-\ntion (less than 0.3 Pearson correlation) with human\njudgments, including FKGL, indicating that these\nmetrics are poor measures of readability for PLS.\nAdditionally, we compare the judgments of 5 LMs\nto human judgments and show that LMs outper-\nform the traditional metrics. We demonstrate that\nLMs have promising potential as evaluators by rea-\nsoning over more complex attributes of readability.\nWe use LM evaluators to re-evaluate 10 summariza-\ntion datasets and show that some summarization\ndatasets intended for PLS achieve similar readabil-\nity scores to those aimed at expert audiences, call-\ning into question the utility of these data. Finally,\nbased on a thorough analysis of current readabil-\nity evaluation practices, we offer recommendations\nfor best practices in PLS evaluation and identify\nopportunities for future work.\n2\nRelated Works\nSummarization evaluation.\nPLS research often\nintroduces either datasets (Goldsack et al., 2022;\nCrossley et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2024; Manor and\nLi, 2019), methods (Guo et al., 2022; August et al.,\n2022; Luo et al., 2022; Ji et al., 2024; Flores et al.,\n2023), or both (Guo et al., 2021; Zaman et al.,\n2020; Chandrasekaran et al., 2020). The majority\nof prior work use a combination of readability met-\nrics, such as Flesch Reading Ease (Flesch, 1943)\nor the Gunning-Fog Index (Gunning, 1952) to vali-\ndate the readability of their dataset or generations.\nReadability metrics are typically reported in con-\njunction with more general summarization metrics,\nsuch as ROUGE (Lin, 2004) or BertScore (Zhang*\net al., 2020). General summarization evaluation is\na well-studied area, with ongoing work analyzing\nboth the efficacy of summarization metrics (Fabbri\net al., 2020; Khashabi et al., 2022; Goyal et al.,\n2022) and designing metrics that better align with\nhuman judgments (Liu et al., 2023c, 2022). Guo\net al. (2023) analyzed how perturbations in plain\nlanguage summaries affect results of general sum-\nmarization metrics. In this work, we focus on read-\nability metrics, rather than general summarization\nmetrics, with the goal of understanding how well\nreadability metrics measure readability for PLS.\nReadability Metrics.\nWhile readability met-\nrics are well studied in fields such as educa-\ntion (Thorndike, 1936; DuBay, 2004; Sibeko and\nvan Zaanen, 2022) and linguistics (Carla Pires and\nVig\u00e1rio, 2017), there is little work studying how\nwell these metrics perform for the task of PLS.\nMost traditional metrics were not designed specifi-\ncally for PLS, or even for evaluation in Computer\nScience. The most common origin of traditional\nmetrics is the need to assess the readability of K-\n12 school texts (Dale and Chall, 1948; Coleman\nand Liau, 1975). Linsear Write was introduced in\nthe book, Gobbledygook has gotta go, published\nby the US Department of the Interior for the pur-\nposes of measuring the complexity of government\ncommunications (O\u2019hayre, 1966). As readability\nmetrics rely primarily on lexical features (Rush,\n1985), prior work has offered criticism of read-\nability metrics, showing that they can be easily\n2\n\nmanipulated to provide better scores with changes\nthat do not substantially improve the readability of\nsummaries (Tanprasert and Kauchak, 2021). Other\nwork has looked at which linguistic attributes are\ncorrelated with readability metrics (\u0160tajner et al.,\n2012). To the best of our knowledge, our work is\nthe first to measure the correlation of readability\nmetrics with human readability judgments.\nLMs as Evaluators.\nRecent advances in LMs\nhave shown that they are capable of reasoning over\ncomplex language (Brown et al., 2020; Wei et al.,\n2022; Yang et al., 2024). LMs have been shown\nto be effective evaluators in other natural language\ntasks (Li et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2024; Nedelchev\net al., 2020; Liu et al., 2023a), including related\nsummarization tasks (Song et al., 2024). Given this\nsuccess in prior work, we hypothesize that LMs\nare capable of evaluating the readability of plain\nlanguage summaries. In particular, we hypothesize\nthat LMs can reason over more complex attributes\nof readability, such as the background required or\nwhether technical concepts are explained.\n3\nExperimental Setup\n3.1\nCurrent PLS evaluation standards RQ1\nWe aim to conduct a thorough literature survey of\nthe standard practices in readability evaluation for\nPLS. We collect papers1 from the ACL Anthol-\nogy2 that mention one of the following key phrases:\n\u201cplain language summarization,\u201d \u201creadable sum-\nmaries,\u201d or \u201clay summarization.\u201d We exclude pa-\npers published for a shared task from annotation\nand assume the participants use the metrics desig-\nnated by the shared task organizers. Our goal is to\nunderstand the decisions made by researchers, and\nincluding shared task papers in this survey would\nover-represent the decisions made by the task orga-\nnizers. We report the evaluation methods used by\nthe shared tasks and the number of participants to\nrepresent the impact of the evaluation choices. We\nidentify 55 papers that match our criteria. We an-\nnotate the papers for relevance to PLS, the type of\npublication (Main conference, Findings, or Work-\nshop), and which readability evaluation metrics are\nused. We exclude papers from the survey not rel-\nevant to PLS, resulting in 18 relevant papers from\nthe years 2013 to 2025. The most common reasons\nfor relevance exclusion include using \u201creadable\u201d in\n1On May 7th, 2025\n2https://aclanthology.org/\na different word sense (e.g. \u201chuman readable\u201d vs\n\u201cmachine readable\u201d) or just citing a PLS paper. We\nreport the number of papers that use each metric.\n3.2\nComparing traditional readability metrics\nto human judgments RQ2\nHuman Annotated Data.\nTo measure the cor-\nrelation between readability metrics with human\njudgments, we use the dataset collected by Au-\ngust et al. (2024). This dataset contains 60 sum-\nmaries of 10 scientific papers in a variety of do-\nmains. Each paper has both expert written and\nmachine written summaries (generated using GPT-\n3.) The summaries are annotated on a scale of 1\nto 5 for the annotator\u2019s reading ease of the article.\n1 indicates a very poor reading ease, while 5 indi-\ncates a very high reading ease. For each summary,\nwe take the average of the annotators\u2019 scores to cal-\nculate the correlations with readability evaluations\nas described below. August et al. (2024) originally\ncollected this dataset to better understand human\npreferences in scientific summarization. In this pa-\nper, we extend their work by applying their findings\nto summarization evaluation metrics. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the only available dataset of\nhuman judgments for PLS. Appendix A contains\nadditional dataset details.\nTraditional readability metrics.\nWe consider\n\u201ctraditional\u201d readability metrics to be those most\ncommonly used in PLS literature.\nThese met-\nrics are well-established, and have been used\nin past work as judges of readability (Chan-\ndrasekaran et al., 2020). This term excludes LM-\nbased evaluations, discussed in \u00a7 3.3. We con-\nsider 8 readability metrics: Flesh-Kincaid Grade\nLevel (FKGL) (Flesch, 1952), Flesch Reading\nEase (FRE) (Flesch, 1943), Dale Chall Readabil-\nity Score (DCRS) (Dale and Chall, 1948), Auto-\nmated Readability Index (ARI) (Smith and Senter,\n1967), Coleman Liau Index (CLI) (Coleman and\nLiau, 1975), Gunning Fog Index (GFI) (Isnaeni,\n2017), Spache (Spache, 1953) and Linsear Write\n(LW) (O\u2019hayre, 1966). All of the metrics, except\nfor DCRS and Spache, use lexical features such\nas number of syllables or length of sentences to\nmeasure readability. DCRS and Spache use word\nfamiliarity to measure readability, assuming that\nmore common words are easier to read (Dale and\nChall, 1948; O\u2019hayre, 1966).3\n3We use the py-readability-metrics package to calculate\nthe readability scores.\n3\n\nQuantifying alignment between traditional met-\nrics and humans.\nWe report the Pearson and\nKendall-Tau correlation of each metric listed above\nwith the human judgments collected by August\net al. (2024). Except for LW and FRE, all met-\nrics provide a lower score for higher readability,\nwhile the human judgments provide a higher score\nfor higher readability. To calculate correlations,\nwe multiply the scores by \u22121 (except for LW and\nFRE), so that text rated as more readable by tra-\nditional metrics will be positively correlated with\nhuman judgments.\n3.3\nLMs as evaluators of readability RQ3\nWe experiment with the following 5 LMs as evalu-\nators of readability: Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023),\nMixtral 7B (Jiang et al., 2024), Gemma 7B (Team,\n2024), Llama 3.1 8B, and Llama 3.3 70B (Dubey\net al., 2024). We experiment with 3 prompts and\nreport the prompts in appendix B. We report the\nPearson and Kendall-Tau correlations of the scores\nprovided by each LM with the human judgments.\n3.4\nAnalysis of summarization datasets RQ4\nTo test the ability of our results to generalize to\ndatasets outside of the one collected by August\net al. (2024), we include datasets with intended\naudiences more specific than \u201cgeneral\u201d - experts\nand kids. We expect expert-targeted datasets to\nbe given low readability scores and kid-targeted\ndatasets to have high readability scores.\nExpert targeted datasets.\nWe include 3 expert-\ntargeted datasets: arXiv, PubMed (Cohan et al.,\n2018) and SciTLDR (Cachola et al., 2020). arXiv\nand PubMed are collections of abstracts in the Com-\nputer Science and Biomedical domains, respec-\ntively (Cohan et al., 2018). SciTLDR is a collection\nof short, expert-targeted, one sentence summaries\nof Computer Science papers. We expect our meth-\nods to provide low readability scores. Additionally,\nthe comparison of SciTLDR to arXiv and PubMed\nallows us to test if the scores are length dependent.\nKid-targeted dataset.\nThe Science Journal for\nKids (SJK) dataset is a collection of summaries of\nscientific papers in a variety of domains, intended\nfor kids (Stefanou et al., 2024). Given that this\ndataset is targeted to kids, we expect it would re-\nceive high readability scores.\nGeneral audience datasets.\nIn addition to the\ndatasets listed above, we evaluate 6 popular\nDataset Audience\nDomain\n# Docs # Tokens\narXiv Experts\nCS\n6440\n163\nPubMed Experts\nMedicine\n6658\n205\nSciTLDR Experts\nCS\n618\n19\nSJK Kids\nVaried\n284\n142\nCDSR General\nHealthcare 284\n221\nPLOS General\nBiomed\n1376\n195\neLife General\nBiomed\n241\n383\nEureka Journalists Varied\n1010\n662\nCELLS General\nBiomed\n6311\n162\nSciNews General\nVaried\n4188\n615\nTable 1: Comparison of the datasets analyzed in this paper.\nThe first 4 are datasets in with a specific target audience. The\nfollowing 6 datasets are commonly used in PLS literature.

These datasets are intended for a general au-\ndience. CDSR, PLOS, and CELLS are written by\njournal editors or experts. eLife Sciences gives pa-\nper authors the option to write \u201ceLife digests,\u201d with\nthe goal of \u201ccutting jargon and putting research in\ncontext.\u201d 4 The Eureka dataset was collected from\nEurekaAlert, which hosts press releases about re-\nsearch for scientific journalists. Finally, SciNews\nis a collection of scientific news reports, written by\nscience reporters.\nTable 1 contains a comparison of the summariza-\ntion datasets analyzed in this paper. We use the\ntest split of each dataset for our analysis and we\nreport the intended audience, domain, number of\ndocuments in the test set, and average number of\nwhite-space delineated tokens. In total, we analyze\n10 popular scientific summarization datasets.\n4\nResults\n4.1\nCurrent PLS evaluation standards RQ1\nWe found 18 ACL Anthology papers on the task of\nPLS and 3 shared tasks, representing 81 additional\npapers. Figure 1 shows the literature survey results,\nexcluding metrics used by a single paper. FKGL\nis the most popular metric, followed by CLI and\nDCRS. LM-based evaluations are uncommon (4\nof the 18 papers). The shared task BioLaySumm\nused FKGL and DCRS for both years, adding CLI\nin 2024. BioLaySumm 2025 is ongoing at the\ntime of writing; the organizers plan to use FKGL,\nDCRS, and CLI.

We additionally report the\nevaluation strategies used by PLS shared tasks and the number\nof participants.\nof participants in shared tasks increased from 8 in\n2020 to 53 in 2024, emphasizing the importance of\nPLS evaluation. Less popular metrics include GFI,\nARI, lexical proxies (e.g., number of sentences in a\ndocument), and FRE. In \u00a7 4.2, we place the highest\nimportance on the results of the most commonly\nused evaluation metrics: FKGL, CLI, and DCRS.\n4.2\nComparing traditional readability metrics\nto human judgments RQ2\nIn Table 2a, we report the Pearson and Kendall-\nTau correlation of 8 traditional readability metrics\nwith human judgments. We find that 6 of the 8\nmetrics have less than 0.3 Pearson correlation with\nhuman judgments. DCRS and CLI have the highest\ncorrelation, achieving 0.2 Pearson points higher\ncorrelation than the most popular metric, FKGL\n(\u00a7 4.1). FKGL receives only 0.16 Pearson and\n0.08 Kendall-Tau correlation, indicating little to no\ncorrelation with human judgment.\nTable 3 shows an example summary and read-\nability scores, along with its human judgment. The\nhuman annotators gave the example summary an\naverage rating of 4.05/5; they found the text fairly\nreadable.\nHowever, the majority of traditional\nmetrics give the summary poor readability scores:\ncollege level or higher.\nThis is likely because\nthe text includes domain-specific vocabulary, such\nas \u201cacute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),\u201d\nwhich is penalized by traditional metrics.

LMs have been shown to perform well on\nmany language understanding tasks (Brown et al.,\n2020; Srivastava et al., 2023), indicating that they\nhave some understanding of language. We hypoth-\nesize that this knowledge will translate well to the\ntask of PLS, and the LMs will be able to reason\nabout more complex features of a summary that\nimpact the readability.\nWe experiment with 3 prompts.

As we\ncan see from the results, PLOS and CELLS are judged to be similarly readable to the expert targets datasets (arXiv, PubMed, and\nSciTLDR). The most readable PLS datasets are CDSR and SciNews.\niTLDR receive low readability scores, averaging\nless than 2/5. This matches our expectations since\nsummaries intended for an expert audience typi-\ncally have low readability for non-experts. We also\nnote that SciTLDR receives similarly low readabil-\nity scores, despite containing significantly shorter\nsummaries than the arXiv and PubMed datasets.\nThis shows that the LM evaluator is not simply\nfavoring shorter summaries as more readable.\nKid-targeted dataset.\nSJK receives high read-\nability scores, with an average readability of 4.40.\nThe results of the expert and kid targeted datasets\nmatch our expectations of readability scores, and\nserve to support the analysis of the remaining 6\ngeneral-audience datasets below.\nGeneral audience datasets.\nWe analyze 6 popu-\nlar PLS datasets: CDSR, PLOS, eLife, Eureka,\nCELLS, and SciNews.\nPLOS and CELLS re-\nceive mean readability scores of 2.06 and 2.23,\nrespectively. These scores are similar to the expert-\ntargeted datasets described above, indicating that\nthese two datasets may not be well-suited for PLS.\nSciNews and CDSR receive the highest readability\nscores, with average scores of 3.49 and 3.37, re-\nspectively, indicating that they are the well suited\nfor the task of PLS.\nKeyword analysis.\nTo understand the LM\u2019s rea-\nsoning for assigning scores, we use the YAKE! al-\ngorithm to extract keywords from the reasoning\nprovided by the LM evaluator for why each sum-\nmary was provided with a specific score (Campos\net al., 2020). Figure 4a contains the keywords strat-\nified by score and Figure 4b contains the keywords\nstratified by dataset. When stratified by score, the\nmodel mentions issues such as requiring \u201cexpert\nbackground knowledge\u201d and \u201cusing specialized\nterms\u201d for summaries with readability scores of\n1 or 2.

This keyword analysis indicates LMs\nare attributing their judgements to deeper attributes\nthat contribute to readability compared to tradi-\ntional metrics.\nLM evaluators vs. traditional metrics.\nFinally,\nwe compare the results of the analysis using tradi-\ntional metrics to LM evaluators of readability. In\nthis analysis, we focus on Llama 3.3 70B, the best\nperforming LM, and FKGL, the most popular read-\nability metric. Table 5 compares the average LM\nreadability and FKGL score for each dataset, and\nhow each metric would rank the datasets. All but 1\ndataset changed their ranking depending on the met-\nric used. arXiv has the largest delta, ranking 10th\nin readability according to the LM evaluator and\n2nd according to FKGL. FKGL ranking arXiv as\nthe 2nd most readable is particularly concerning, as\nthis dataset is a collection of scientific abstracts, in-\ntended for an expert audience. To measure disagree-\nment, we convert each metric into binary scores of\n\u201chigh readability\u201d and \u201clow readability.\u201d For FKGL,\nwe consider any summary given a score of under\n12 points to have high readability. FKGL consid-\ners any text above 12 to be college reading level.\nFor the LM evaluator, we consider any summary\ngiven a score of 3 or higher to have high readability.\nBy converting the scores to binary labels, we cal-\nculate the Cohen\u2019s Kappa score (McHugh, 2012)\nfor agreement as 0.17, indicating the two metrics\nhave fair but not substantial agreement. We pro-\nvide examples of this disagreement in Table 6. This\nanalysis shows how the evaluation metrics we use\ncan greatly influence the conclusions we draw.\n5\nDiscussion\nWe found PLS an increasingly popular area of\nstudy, but researchers primarily rely on a handful\nof traditional metrics for evaluation. However, we\nfound that traditional metrics are imperfect mea-\nsures of readability and LM evaluators can draw\nsignificantly different, and more accurate, conclu-\nsions about PLS datasets than when using FKGL,\nthe most common metric.\nLM Eval\nFKGL\nDataset\nS\nR\nS\nR\n\u2206R\narXiv\n1.31\n10\n11.53\n2\n+8\nPubMed\n1.99\n8\n14.14\n5\n+3\nSciTLDR\n1.86\n9\n15.66\n10\n\u22121\nSKJ\n4.40\n1\n8.41\n1\n0\nCDSR\n3.49\n2\n14.08\n4\n\u22122\nPLOS\n2.06\n7\n15.44\n9\n\u22122\neLife\n3.18\n5\n11.87\n3\n+2\nEureka\n3.21\n4\n14.87\n6\n\u22122\nCELLS\n2.23\n6\n15.35\n8\n\u22122\nSciNews\n3.37\n3\n14.98\n7\n\u22124\nTable 5: The mean score (S) and rank (R) for each dataset,\nas judged by an LM evaluator and FKGL. \u2206R represents the\nchange in rank from the LM evaluator to the FKGL scores.\n5.1\nWhy traditional readability metrics are\ninsufficient measures of readability\nWe consider 2 explanations for the poor correlation\nof readability metrics with human judgments: defi-\nnitional inconsistency or measurement error. Defi-\nnitional inconsistency means that the definition of\n\u201creadable,\u201d as measured by the metrics, differs from\nthe definition of \u201creadable,\u201d as considered by hu-\nman judges. Measurement error means that, even\nif we have the correct definition, we are not mea-\nsuring readability properly. We argue that there is\nevidence for both problems.\nOn definitional inconsistency, the majority of\nreadability metrics originated in the education do-\nmain. Traditional readability metrics typically de-\nfine a \u201creadable\u201d text as one with an appropriate\ntext complexity for the number of years of ed-\nucation (i.e., a text has a US 9th grade reading\nlevel) (Gunning, 1952; Coleman and Liau, 1975;\nFlesch, 1952). In contrast, the field of PLS typically\ndefines a \u201creadable\u201d text as one that gives a non-\nexpert, adult reader an overall understanding of\nthe source article. These different definitions have\ndifferent implications for the resulting text. If opti-\nmizing for education-appropriate text complexity,\nwe can measure the complexity of the vocabulary\nor sentences. However, using the PLS definition\nof readability, we should measure features such as\nwhether the text includes explanations of techni-\ncal terms or how much background is required to\nunderstand the concepts.\nTraditional readability metrics also suffer from\nmeasurement error. Even if we assume a consistent\ndefinition, traditional metrics do not properly mea-\nsure readability. They measure lexical properties,\nsuch as number of syllables in a word, which penal-\nizes summaries for using clearly defined technical\nterms. Traditional metrics also do not measure\ndeeper features that contribute to readability, such\nas how much background is required to understand\n8\n\nWind power is an important source of renewable energy,\nbut some people are concerned that conventional wind\nturbines are too loud and too hazardous for birds and\nbats. We wanted to create a new kind of wind energy\nharvesting machine based on the jiggling motion of cot-\ntonwood tree leaves in the wind, which would be quieter\nand safer for wildlife. After building and testing artificial\ncottonwood leaves that moved and created electricity in\nthe wind, we found that they didn\u2019t produce enough en-\nergy to feasibly use for electricity production. We also\ntried building a cattail-like device to generate electricity\nwhen it swayed in the wind, [...]\n(a) FKGL = 16.47 (College-graduate), LM score = 4/5.\nIntroduction. Accumulation of glycochenodeoxycholic acid\n(GCDC) in serum has a clinical significance as an inductor of\npathological hepatocyte apoptosis, which impairs liver function.\nInhibition of GCDC accumulation can be used as a marker in\ntherapy. This study was aimed to quantify the serum level of\nGCDC in obstructive jaundice patients. Methodology. GCDC\nacid level in the serum was quantified using high performance\nliquid chromatography (HPLC) technique according to Muraca\nand Ghoos modified method. It was performed before and after\ndecompression at day 7 and day 14. The sample was extracted\nwith solid phase extraction (SPE) technique on SPE column.\nThe results were analyzed using SPSS V 16.0 (P < 0.05) [...]\n(b) FKGL = 10.0 (10th grade), LM score = 1/5.\nTable 6: Examples of disagreement between FKGL and the LM evaluator. 6a contains an example from the SJK dataset that the\nLM rated high readability and FKGL rated low readability. 6b contains a summary from the Pubmed dataset that the LM rated\nlow readability while FKGL rated high readability.\nthe text. In \u00a7 4.3, we show that LMs are better able\nto reason over these more complex attributes.\nTable 6 shows examples in which the LM evalu-\nator and FKGL disagree on the readability. FKGL\nrates a summary from the SJK dataset as having a\ngraduate-college reading level, while the LM rates\nit as highly readable (Table 6a). Although the sum-\nmary explains the concepts well, long words such\nas \u201charvesting\u201d and \u201celectricity\u201d likely cause FKGL\nto rate the summary as less readable. Table 6b has\na Pubmed example, which the LM rates as having\nlow readability, while FKGL assigns the summary\na 10th grade reading level. This example contains\nmany short words, such as \u201cGCDC\u201d and \u201cSPE\u201d,\nwhich are favored by FKGL. Although short, these\ntechnical words that are not well defined. For exam-\nple, the \u201cGCDC\u201d is defined as \u201cglycochenodeoxy-\ncholic acid,\u201d but is not otherwise explained. In\ngeneral, we notice that FKGL favors acronyms,\nwhich are often present in technical text.\n5.2\nRecommendations and Future Directions\nWe find that many traditional readability metrics\nhave poor correlation with human judgments and\nthat LMs provide better judgments. However, LM-\nevaluators are an imperfect solution since they are\nsubject to bias and a lack of interpretability (Liu\net al., 2023b; Wang et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023;\nStureborg et al., 2024).\nTherefore, we recom-\nmend a multi-faceted evaluation of PLS that uses a\ncombination of traditional readability metrics and\nLM evaluators. Specifically, we recommend using\nDCRS and CLI, which have the highest correlation\nwith human judgments. We recommend discon-\ntinuing use of FKGL for PLS, the current most\npopular metric, due to low correlation with human\njudgment. We recommend using LMs as additional\nmetrics, especially for more qualitative evaluations,\nsuch as the keyword analysis conducted in \u00a7 4.3.\nThese types of analyses give a more holistic view\nof the benefits and downsides of datasets and meth-\nods. Finally, we recommend that PLS research use\ndatasets with higher readability scores (\u00a7 4.3), such\nas CDSR and SciNews. We recommend that PLOS\nand CELLS be considered general scientific sum-\nmarization datasets and not plain language datasets.\nThis recommendation is particularly impactful as\nPLOS has been used in every year the shared task\nBioLaySumm has occurred (Goldsack et al., 2024,\n2023).\nFuture work should focus on constructing met-\nrics that better align with human judgments of read-\nability in both definition and measurement (\u00a7 5.1).\nWe show that LMs are promising and worthy of\nfuture work that can decrease bias and improve in-\nterpretability. Dataset collection should focus on\ncollecting highly readable summaries and consider\ndeeper attributes of readable summaries, such as\nexplanations of technical concepts.\nLimitations\nThe conclusions of this paper are limited to the task\nof plain language summarization, and are not in-\ntended to apply to other applications of readability\nmetrics, such as judging the age-level appropri-\nateness of educational material. Additionally, our\nhuman judgments and experiments focused on the\nsummarization of scientific articles, and may not\ngeneralize to PLS in other domains, such as law\nor clinical notes. Finally, our experiments are lim-\nited to the English language, and our findings may\nnot apply to other languages. We leave the explo-\nration of readability evaluation in other domains\nand languages to future work.\n9\n\nEthical Considerations\nThis paper involves the use of LMs for genera-\ntion and evaluation. LMs have been shown to gen-\nerate factually incorrect information and are sub-\nject to bias (Venkit et al., 2024; Stureborg et al.,\n2024). Additionally, the use of language models\ncontributes to the environmental footprint of our\nfield (Schwartz et al., 2020). However, this paper\nfocuses on the evaluation of plain language summa-\nrization, which has the potential to make scientific\nknowledge more accessible to the general popula-\ntion. Therefore, we believe that the benefits of this\nwork outweigh the potential harms.\nAcknowledgments\nWe\u2019d like to thank the authors of August et al.\n(2024) for sharing their human-annotated dataset\nwith us.

Association for Com-\nputing Machinery.\n15\n\nAppendix\nA\nHuman annotated dataset details\nWe use the human annotated data collected by Au-\ngust et al. (2024). The dataset includes 60 sum-\nmaries over 10 papers, 6 summaries per paper. Of\nthe 6 summaries, 2 are written by experts and 4\nare machine written by GPT3. The 10 papers were\nsampled from the top 10% of papers from r/science,\na subreddit dedicated to public discussions of scien-\ntific papers. These papers were chosen as a proxy\nfor scientific topics the general public is most in-\nterested in. The dataset was annotated by 593 Me-\nchanical Turk workers in total across the three tasks\nin the original study. Table 7 contains the distribu-\ntions of scores assigned by the human annotators.\nScore\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n%\n37\n29\n17\n10\n7\nTable 7: Percentage of scores assigned in human annotated\ndataset for reading ease.\nIn order to measure inter-annotator agreement,\nwe bin the scores into a binary \u201chigh-readability\u201d\nand \u201clow readability.\u201d Summaries given scores of 3\nor higher are considered highly readable while sum-\nmaries assigned scores less than 3 are considered\nto have low readability. We use Cohen\u2019s Kappa to\ncalculate an inter-annotator agreement of 0.6. This\nis a moderate agreement for a somewhat subjective\ntask, indicating that there is some general notion of\nreadability. We also note that this is significantly\nhigher than the agreement between traditional met-\nrics and LMs (0.17 as shown in \u00a7 4.4).\nB\nLM readability evaluation prompts\nWe experiment with 3 prompts, shown in Table 10.\nThe Simple Prompt simply asks the LM to rate the\ntext for reading ease on a scale of 1 to 5. The Amer-\nican Society for Cell Biology (ASCB) provides\nguidelines for best practices in scientific commu-\nnication.5 In the ASCB Prompt, we provide these\nguidelines to the LM as guidance for rating the read-\nability.

Voice prompts and text scripts provide initial input.\nVIBEVOICE processes hybrid context features, and its hidden states condition a token level Diffusion\nHead (D), which predicts acoustic VAE for speech segments, subsequently recovered by acoustic\ndecoder (A).\n1\nIntroduction\nWhile recent advancements in Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis have achieved remarkable suc-\ncess in generating high-fidelity, natural-sounding speech for single speakers in short utter-\nances [WCW+23, SJT+23, ACC+24a, LVS+23, CNM+24, DWC+24a, JCC+25, YZC+25], a sig-\nnificant frontier remains in the scalable synthesis of long-form, multi-speaker conversational audio,\nsuch as podcasts and multi-participant audiobooks. Although traditional systems can technically pro-\nduce such audio by concatenating individually synthesized utterances, achieving natural turn-taking\nand content-aware generation are major challenges. Recently, research on multi-speaker long conver-\nsational speech generation has begun to emerge [Goo24, PSJ+24, Nar25, Ope25, Ses25, LWI+24].\nHowever, most of these works are either not open-sourced [Goo24, PSJ+24] or still face challenges\nin terms of generation length and stability [ZQW+25, Ses25, JYY+25, Ope25].\nIn this work, we introduce VIBEVOICE, as illustrated in Figure 2, a novel framework developed for\nthe scalable synthesis of long-form and multi-speaker speech. To support long audio generation, we\nhave pioneered the development of a causal speech tokenizer that achieves a 3200\u00d7 compression\nrate (i.e., 7.5 Hz frame rate). In our experiments, this highly efficient tokenizer maintains a speech-\nto-text token ratio of approximately 2:1, meaning two speech tokens are roughly equivalent to one\nBPE [SHB15] text token.\nWe utilize a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM, e.g., Qwen2.5 [YYZ+24]) to interpret complex\nuser inputs, including detailed text sentences and role assignments. We have streamlined the architec-\nture by removing unnecessary prior designs: voice latent features and text scripts are concatenated\ninto a single sequence and fed directly into the LLM. The LLM then processes this context to predict\na hidden state, which in turn conditions a lightweight, token-level Diffusion Head [LTL+24]. This\ndiffusion head is responsible for predicting the continuous Variational Autoencoder (VAE) features,\nwhich are subsequently recovered into the final audio output by speech tokenizer decoder.\nDespite its architectural simplicity, VIBEVOICE yields an exceptionally powerful TTS model. It\ndemonstrates remarkable flexibility in handling multiple speakers and achieves a synthesis length\nof up to 90 minutes. Scaling the LLM from 1.5B to 7B, the larger model exhibits significant\ngains in perceptual quality, delivering richer timbre, more natural intonation, and enhanced transfer\ncapabilities, such as in cross-lingual applications.\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nMethod\n2.1\nSpeech Tokenizers\nWe employ two separate tokenizers as input to learn both acoustic and semantic features. In our\nexperiments, generating long-form speech benefits from this separate design.\nAcoustic Tokenizer adopts the principles of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) [KW14], specifically\ndrawing inspiration from the \u03c3-VAE variant proposed in LatentLM [SBW+24] to mitigate potential\nvariance collapse issues of VAEs when used in autoregressive modeling settings. The process involves\nan encoder network, parameterized by \u03d5, which maps the input audio x to the parameters of a latent\ndistribution, primarily the mean \u00b5. Notably, variance \u03c3 is a pre-defined distribution (N(0, C\u03c3)) in \u03c3-\nVAE, rather than a learnable distribution in VAE [KW14]. A latent vector z is then sampled using the\nreparameterization trick. Following the \u03c3-VAE approach to ensure robust variance for autoregressive\nmodeling, we can formulate this as: z = \u00b5 + \u03c3 \u2299\u03f5, where \u03f5 \u223cN(0, 1), \u03c3 \u223cN(0, C\u03c3).\nThe architecture is a mirror-symmetric encoder-decoder structure. The encoder employs a hierarchical\ndesign with 7 stages of modified Transformer blocks [VSP+17] (using 1D depth-wise causal convo-\nlutions instead of self-attention module) for efficient streaming processing. Six downsampling layers\nachieve a cumulative 3200X downsampling rate from a 24kHz input, yielding 7.5 tokens/frames\nper second. Each encoder/decoder component has approximately 340M parameters. The training\nobjective follows the DAC [KSL+23], including its discriminator and loss designs.\nSemantic Tokenizer mirrors the hierarchical architecture of the Acoustic Tokenizer\u2019s encoder, but\nwithout VAE components, as its objective is deterministic content-centric feature extraction. The\nmain difference is the training objective, which uses Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) as the\nproxy task. During training, its output is decoded by several Transformer decoder layers to predict\ntext transcripts, aligning the semantic encoder\u2019s representations with textual semantics. This decoder\nis discarded after pre-training.\n2.2\nVIBEVOICE\nVIBEVOICE employs a Large Language Model (LLM) as its core sequence model, integrated with\nspecialized audio encoding and diffusion-based decoding modules to achieve scalable, high-fidelity\nmulti-speaker speech synthesis. The overall inference architecture is depicted in Figure 2.\nInput Representation: The model input X is formed by concatenating the voice font features\nand the text script embeddings, specified by users, interleaved with role identifiers (Speakerk):\nX = [Speaker1 : z1, Speaker2 : z2, ..., SpeakerN : zN] + [Speaker1 : T1, Speaker2 :\nT2, ..., SpeakerN : TN], where zN is acoustic latent representations and TN is each role\u2019s text\nscripts. For the generated speech segment s, it will be encoded by acoustic tokenizer and semantic\ntokenizer to form the hybrid speech representation for the auto-regressive modeling.\nToken-Level Diffusion: To synthesize speech in a streaming way, VIBEVOICE employs a lightweight\ndiffusion head [LTL+24] conditioned on the LLM\u2019s hidden state of each token, hi. During training,\nthis diffusion head is optimized to reverse a forward noising process by predicting the noise [HJA20]\nadded to the clean acoustic VAE features za,i. During inference, this diffusion head iteratively refines\na randomly sampled Gaussian noise vector to predict the target acoustic VAE feature, za,i. This\ndenoising process is enhanced using Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which interpolates between a\nconditional prediction (guided by hi) and an unconditional prediction. An efficient sampler, such\nas DPM-Solver++ [LZB+22, LZB+25], is utilized to accelerate this iterative process, ultimately\nyielding a clean acoustic feature estimate.\nWe instantiated VIBEVOICE\u2019s core LLM using the 1.5B and 7B parameter versions of Qwen2.5\n[YYZ+24]. The diffusion head [LTL+24] comprises 4 layers. During VIBEVOICE training, the\npre-trained acoustic and semantic tokenizers remained frozen, with only the LLM and diffusion head\nparameters being learnable. We employed a curriculum learning strategy for the LLM input sequence\nlength, progressively increasing from 4,096 to 65,536 tokens. The guidance scale is 1.3 and the\niterative denoising step is 10 for VIBEVOICE.\n3\n\nModel\nSubjective\nObjective\nRealism\nRichness\nPreference\nAverage\nWER (Whisper)\nWER (Nemo)\nSIM\nNari Labs Dia [Nar25]\n-\n-\n-\n-\n11.96\n10.79\n0.541\nMooncast [JYY+25]\n-\n-\n-\n-\n2.81\n3.29\n0.562\nSesameAILabs-CSM [Ses25]\n2.89 \u00b11.15\n3.03 \u00b11.11\n2.75 \u00b11.08\n2.89 \u00b11.12\n2.66\n3.05\n0.685\nHiggs Audio V2 [Bos25]\n2.95 \u00b11.13\n3.19 \u00b11.06\n2.83 \u00b11.16\n2.99 \u00b11.13\n5.94\n5.97\n0.543\nElevenlabs v3 alpha [Ele]\n3.34 \u00b11.11\n3.48 \u00b11.05\n3.38 \u00b11.12\n3.40 \u00b11.09\n2.39\n2.47\n0.623\nGemini 2.5 pro preview tts [Goo]\n3.55 \u00b11.20\n3.78 \u00b11.11\n3.65 \u00b11.15\n3.66 \u00b11.16\n1.73\n2.43\n-\nVIBEVOICE-1.5B\n3.59 \u00b10.95\n3.59 \u00b11.01\n3.44 \u00b10.92\n3.54 \u00b10.96\n1.11\n1.82\n0.548\nVIBEVOICE-7B\n3.71 \u00b10.98\n3.81 \u00b10.87\n3.75 \u00b10.94\n3.76 \u00b10.93\n1.29\n1.95\n0.692\nTable 1: Human subjective and objective evaluation results.

Best results are in bold.\n3\nResults\n3.1\nVIBEVOICE Podcast\nWe conducted both objective and subjective evaluations to benchmark the performance of the\nproposed VIBEVOICE against recent state-of-the-art conversational speech generation systems [Nar25,\nJYY+25, Ses25, Bos25, Ele, Goo].\nTo manage the labor-intensive and time-consuming nature of subjective evaluation, we designed a\ncompact test set. This set consists of 8 long conversational transcripts with a total duration of about 1\nhour. We used speech prompts to ensure consistent timbre across the different models. Since Gemini\n2.5 Pro preview TTS does not support speech-prompt control, we used its default male and female\nvoices for comparison instead.\nFor our objective evaluation, we measure Word Error Rate (WER) and speaker similarity. WER\nis obtained by transcribing the generated speech using Whisper-large-v3 [RKX+23] and Nemo\nASR [XJM+23]. Speaker similarity (SIM) is computed by extracting speaker embeddings with\nWavLM-large [CWC+22].\nFor subjective evaluation, we recruited 24 human annotators to provide Mean Opinion Scores (MOS)\nacross three dimensions: Realism (how natural and human-like the speech sounds, including prosody,\nemotion, and the smoothness of speaker turns), Richness (the expressiveness of the speech in terms\nof tone and emotion, including variation and adaptation to context), and Preference (overall listener\nenjoyment and subjective preference, reflecting naturalness, pleasantness, and engagement). The\nevaluation covered six models with all eight test samples, meaning that each annotator listened to\napproximately six hours of audio in total.\nWe can observe that: The proposed VIBEVOICE models outperform all other top-tier models\non long conversational speech generation across both objective and subjective metrics. Com-\npared with the VIBEVOICE-1.5B model, the VIBEVOICE-7B model achieves significantly better\nperformance on all objective metrics and SIM, while maintaining a comparable WER.\n3.2\nVIBEVOICE Short Utterance\nWe evaluate VIBEVOICE on the SEED test sets [ACC+24b], a widely used benchmark composed of\nshort utterances. For evaluation, approximately 1,000 English samples and 2,000 Chinese samples\nare drawn from the CommonVoice dataset, denoted as test-en and test-zh, respectively. We compute\nword error rate (WER) using Whisper-large-v3 for test-en and Paraformer [GZMY22] for test-zh. For\nspeaker similarity (SIM), we adopt a WavLM-large [CWC+22] model.\nTable 2 presents the results on the SEED test sets. Although our model is primarily trained on\nlong-form speech, it demonstrates strong generalization on short-utterance benchmarks. In addition,\nby employing a lower frame rate, our model substantially reduces the number of decoding steps\nrequired to synthesize one second of speech.\n4\n\nModel\nFrame Rate\ntest-zh\ntest-en\nCER(%) \u2193\nSIM \u2191\nWER(%) \u2193\nSIM \u2191\nMaskGCT [WZL+24]\n50\n2.27\n0.774\n2.62\n0.714\nSeed-TTS [ACC+24b]\n-\n1.12\n0.796\n2.25\n0.762\nFireRedTTS [GLS+24]\n25\n1.51\n0.635\n3.82\n0.460\nCosyVoice 2 [DWC+24b]\n25\n1.45\n0.748\n2.57\n0.652\nSpark TTS [WJM+25]\n50\n1.20\n0.672\n1.98\n0.584\nVIBEVOICE-1.5B\n7.5\n1.16\n0.744\n3.04\n0.689\nTable 2: Results on the SEED test sets.\nTokenizer\nNq\nToken\ntest-clean\ntest-other\nRate\nPESQ\nSTOI\nUTMOS\nPESQ\nSTOI\nUTMOS\nGround-Truth\n-\n-\n-\n-\n4.056\n-\n-\n3.483\nEncodec [DCSA22]\n8\n600\n2.72\n0.939\n3.04\n2.682\n0.924\n2.657\nDAC [KSL+23]\n4\n400\n2.738\n0.928\n3.433\n2.595\n0.908\n2.945\nEncodec [DCSA22]\n4\n300\n2.052\n0.901\n2.307\n2.052\n0.884\n2.088\nSpeechTokenizer [ZZL+23]\n4\n300\n1.931\n0.878\n3.563\n1.737\n0.837\n3.018\nDAC [KSL+23]\n1\n100\n1.246\n0.771\n1.494\n1.245\n0.751\n1.499\nWavTokenizer [JJW+25]\n1\n75\n2.373\n0.914\n4.049\n2.261\n0.891\n3.431\nWavTokenizer [JJW+25]\n1\n40\n1.703\n0.862\n3.602\n1.662\n0.834\n3.055\nOurs (Acoustic)\n1\n7.5\n3.068\n0.828\n4.181\n2.848\n0.823\n3.724\nTable 3: Objective evaluation of speech tokenizer\u2019s reconstruction quality on the LibriTTS test-clean\nand test-other datasets.

To\nquantify this, we measured PESQ [RBHH01], STOI [THHJ10] and UTMOS [SXN+22] on both the\nLibriTTS test-clean and test-other datasets [ZDC+19]. Table 3 shows that our acoustic tokenizer,\nuniquely operating at an ultra-low 7.5 Hz, achieves leading PESQ and UTMOS scores on both\ntest-clean (PESQ: 3.068, UTMOS: 4.181) and test-other (PESQ: 2.848, UTMOS: 3.724) subsets.\nThis demonstrates its capacity for high-fidelity, perceptually excellent audio reconstruction despite\naggressive compression, which is a key factor for VIBEVOICE\u2019s scalability with long-form audio.\n4\nConclusion, Limitations, and Risks\nWe introduced VIBEVOICE, a novel framework for long-form and multi-speaker speech generation.\nBy integrating efficient hybrid speech representations from specialized ultra-low frame rate (7.5 Hz)\nacoustic and semantic tokenizers with an end-to-end LLM-based next-token diffusion framework,\nVIBEVOICE achieves state-of-the-art performance. It scalably synthesizes high-quality audio for up\nto 90 minutes with up to 4 speakers, demonstrably surpassing existing baselines in both subjective\nperceptual quality\u2014including preference, realism, and richness\u2014and objective metrics like WER,\nthereby significantly advancing the capabilities of conversational TTS.\nEnglish and Chinese only: Transcripts in languages other than English or Chinese may result in\nunexpected audio outputs.\nNon-Speech Audio: The model focuses solely on speech synthesis and does not handle background\nnoise, music, or other sound effects.\nOverlapping Speech: The current model does not explicitly model or generate overlapping speech\nsegments in conversations.\nPotential for Deepfakes and Disinformation: High-quality synthetic speech can be misused to\ncreate convincing fake audio content for impersonation, fraud, or spreading disinformation. Users\n5\n\nmust ensure transcripts are reliable, check content accuracy, and avoid using generated content in\nmisleading ways.\nWe do not recommend using VIBEVOICE in commercial or real-world applications without further\ntesting and development.

While auto-\nmated scientific reasoners hold great promise\nfor assisting human scientists, there is currently\nno widely adopted holistic benchmark for eval-\nuating scientific reasoning, and few approaches\nsystematically disentangle the distinct roles of\nknowledge and reasoning in these tasks. To\naddress these gaps, we introduce SCIREAS, a\ndiverse suite of existing benchmarks for sci-\nentific reasoning tasks, and SCIREAS-PRO, a\nselective subset that requires more complex\nreasoning. Our holistic evaluation surfaces in-\nsights about scientific reasoning performance\nthat remain hidden when relying on individual\nbenchmarks alone. We then propose KRUX,\na probing framework for studying the distinct\nroles of reasoning and knowledge in scientific\ntasks.\nCombining the two, we conduct an\nin-depth analysis that yields several key find-\nings: (1) Retrieving task-relevant knowledge\nfrom model parameters is a critical bottleneck\nfor LLMs in scientific reasoning; (2) Reason-\ning models consistently benefit from external\nknowledge added in-context on top of the rea-\nsoning enhancement; (3) Enhancing verbalized\nreasoning improves LLMs\u2019 ability to surface\ntask-relevant knowledge. Finally, we conduct\na lightweight analysis, comparing our science-\nfocused data composition with concurrent ef-\nforts on long CoT SFT, and release SCILIT01,\na strong 8B baseline for scientific reasoning.1\n1\nIntroduction\nRecent frontier reasoning models, such as Ope-\nnAI\u2019s o-series (OpenAI et al., 2024) and DeepSeek-\nR1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025), demonstrate sig-\nnificant advances by leveraging increased test-\ntime compute to enable intermediate reasoning\n*These authors contributed equally to this work.\n1The codebase and artifacts are released at https://\ngithub.com/yale-nlp/SciReas-Eval.\nsteps (Wei et al., 2023; Kojima et al., 2023). These\napproaches facilitate advanced mechanisms, includ-\ning methodology exploration (Yao et al., 2023),\nself-verification (Ma et al., 2025a), and backtrack-\ning (Yang et al., 2025b), resulting in improvements\non tasks such as mathematics and coding with more\ntest-time compute (Muennighoff et al., 2025).\nThese advances in reasoning capabilities open\nup opportunities for applying LLMs to complex sci-\nentific tasks (Lu et al., 2024; Gottweis et al., 2025;\nSchmidgall et al., 2025). However, scientific work\ndemands not only rigorous reasoning but also deep\ndomain knowledge, from specialized concepts and\nfoundational theories to hands-on methodological\nexpertise and familiarity with obscure yet pivotal\nfindings. Successful scientific reasoning systems\nmust apply such knowledge in complex multi-step\nreasoning processes (Zhao et al., 2023; Wang et al.,\n2023a; Wadden et al., 2024a; Li et al., 2025).\nWhile a variety of scientific benchmarks ex-\nist (e.g., GPQA (Rein et al., 2024) and MMLU-\nPro (Wang et al., 2024b)), there is no holistic and\nunified benchmark that comprehensively targets sci-\nentific reasoning. Existing individual benchmarks\ntypically focus narrowly on specific domains, task\nformats, or skill types. For example, although\nGPQA is challenging, it focuses exclusively on\nmultiple-choice questions within a limited range of\ndomains. Furthermore, there is a lack of analytical\ntools that can isolate the distinct roles that reason-\ning and scientific knowledge play when performing\nsophisticated scientific tasks.\nWe introduce datasets and methods to facili-\ntate the study of scientific problem solving. First,\nwe present SCIREAS, a unified suite of ten pub-\nlic benchmarks that span physics, chemistry, biol-\nogy, medicine, materials, mathematics, computer\nscience, and engineering, with multiple-choice,\nfill-in-the-blank, structured, and protocol/procedu-\nral questions. To improve evaluation efficiency and\nsharpen the focus on reasoning difficulty, we manu-\n1\narXiv:2508.19202v1  [cs.CL]  26 Aug 2025\n\nQuestion Q: While operating on variable frequency supplies, the AC motor requires variable voltage in order to ____. \n(A) extend the motor's lifespan. (B) increase the motor's efficiency. (C) avoid effect of saturation (D) ...\nReasoning R + Answer A: <think> Okay, so I need to figure out why an AC motor requires variable voltage \nwhen operating on variable frequency supplies \u2026 </think>\u2026Therefore, the answer is (C). \nk1: The synchronous speed of an AC motor is proportional to the ratio of supply frequency to the number \nof motor poles.\nk2: Induction motors require maintenance of a constant voltage-to-frequency ratio for optimal operation.\nk3: Maintaining constant voltage while decreasing supply frequency increases magnetic flux, risking core \nsaturation.\n\u2026\nQuestion w/ KIs\nQuestion Q: \u2026\nHere are some knowledge points that \ncould be helpful:\n- k1\n- k2\n- k3\n\u2026 \nBase-Math\nBase-STEM\nBase-BOTH\nDeepSeek-R1\nBase\nKI Extractor\nKnowledge \nIngredients (KIs)\nBase-Math\nBase-STEM\nBase-BOTH\nBase\nRQ1, 2\nRQ3\nResponse\nKnowledge \nSource\nEvaluated \nModel\nFigure 1: KRUX pipeline. Starting from the upper left, we prompt an LLM (one of base, DeepSeek-R1, Base-Math,\nBase-STEM, and Base-BOTH) with a question from SCIREAS as knowledge source, collect the output and reasoning\ntraces, and feed the reasoning traces to DeepSeek-R1 as the extractor to generate knowledge ingredients (KIs). We\nthen evaluate the tested model with KI-augmented questions, which allows us to study three key research questions\n(RQ1, RQ2, RQ3) regarding LLMs\u2019 knowledge and reasoning capabilities in scientific problem-solving.\nally inspect each subtask and retain only those that\nare subject-relevant and reasoning-intensive, while\npreserving broad domain coverage. Furthermore,\nto facilitate standardized evaluation, we provide an\nefficient and unified implementation of streamlined\nassessment across individual benchmarks, avoid-\ning the need to set up different environments or\ndataset-specific boilerplate for each dataset (\u00a73).\nNext, we introduce SCIREAS-PRO, a compact\nsubset of SCIREAS tailored for evaluating more\nchallenging reasoning.\nSpecifically, SCIREAS-\nPRO is constructed by selecting examples from\nSCIREAS where only reasoning models with high\ninference-time compute budget (or the highest al-\nlowed number of thinking tokens) succeed. We find\nthat despite containing only 8% as many examples\nas SCIREAS, SCIREAS-PRO better differentiates\nweak and strong reasoners (\u00a73).\nHaving constructed the reasoning-intensive sci-\nentific benchmarks, our next goal is to leverage\nthem to study how verbalized chain-of-thought\n(CoT) reasoning affects knowledge recall and usage\n(\u00a74). To study this, we design KRUX (Knowledge\n& Reasoning Utilization eXams), a probing frame-\nwork which supplies models with atomic \u201cknowl-\nedge ingredients\u201d (KIs) extracted from other mod-\nels\u2019 reasoning traces. This technique allows for\nmore controlled analyses of reasoning and knowl-\nedge, which we use to perform three in-depth in-\nvestigations that lead to the following findings:\n(1) Vanilla instruct models can outperform their\nreasoning counterparts by \u226510% once KIs are\nprovided in-context, suggesting that internaliz-\ning and retrieving the right knowledge is a key\nbottleneck for scientific reasoning tasks.\n(2) When both model families receive the same\nKIs from a strong reasoner (e.g., DeepSeek-R1),\nthe reasoning-fine-tuned models consistently out-\nperform the base models, showing that reason-\ning models are capable of utilizing external in-\ncontext knowledge for additional improvements.\n(3) Feeding KIs from a reasoning-fine-tuned model\nto its base model can boost performance even when\nthe KIs are already known by the base model, indi-\ncating that reasoning-fine-tuning aids knowledge\nrecall by surfacing more relevant knowledge.\nOur contributions can be summarized as:\n\u2022 We introduce SCIREAS, a unified and holistic\nbenchmark suite spanning a broad range of scien-\ntific domains and problem types, allowing us to\nsurface insights that otherwise remain hidden if\nrelying on individual datasets only. We also re-\nlease a reasoning-focused subset SCIREAS-PRO\nthat allows efficient benchmarking of sophisticated\nreasoning with more room for improvement.\n\u2022 We present KRUX, a novel analytic frame-\nwork which we use to conduct a comprehensive\nempirical study that disentangles the impacts of\nknowledge and reasoning.\n\u2022 We provide an in-depth analysis with three key\nfindings: (i) knowledge retrieval is a bottleneck;\n(ii) in-context knowledge consistently benefits rea-\nsoning models; and (iii) long CoT improves knowl-\nedge surfacing. We support these findings with\ncontrolled post-training experiments.\nFinally, to foster the development of open-source\nscientific reasoning models, we conduct light-\nweight analyses comparing our Math+STEM data\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncomposition with concurrent long CoT supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) post-training efforts, and release\nSCILIT01, a strong scientific reasoning baseline\nbuilt on Qwen3-8B-Base (Yang et al., 2025a).\n2\nRelated Work\nScientific Benchmarks\nExisting scientific bench-\nmarks span a wide array of domains and tasks, but\neach tends to focus on specific disciplines or sub-\nskills, often lacking explicit emphasis on multi-step\nreasoning or standardized implementation. For\nexample, most tasks in SciRIFF (Wadden et al.,\n2024a) focus on context-grounded information QA,\nrather than demanding reasoning. Benchmarks like\nGPQA (Rein et al., 2024) and LabBench (Lau-\nrent et al., 2024) pose reasoning challenges, yet\nthey cover only a limited range of scientific do-\nmains and rely on multiple-choice QA formats.\nImplementation-wise, benchmarks lack standard-\nized prompts, evaluation metrics, or consistent scor-\ning, making reproducibility and fair comparison\ndifficult (Gu et al., 2025; Gao et al., 2024).\nTo address this fragmentation, our study system-\natically incorporates 10 prominent scientific bench-\nmarks, GPQA, MMLU-Pro (Wang et al., 2024b),\nSuperGPQA (Team et al., 2025b), LabBench,\nOlympiadBench (He et al., 2024), SciBench (Wang\net al., 2023b), SciRIFF, UGPhysics (Xu et al.,\n2025), SciEval (Sun et al., 2024), and SciKnowE-\nval (Feng et al., 2024), enabling a unified, compre-\nhensive, and reproducible evaluation of scientific\nreasoning capabilities.\nKnowledge & Reasoning An important line of\nwork on disentangling reasoning and knowledge\ndesigns specialized tasks (e.g., linguistically chal-\nlenging questions (Bean et al., 2024; Khouja et al.,\n2025) or synthetic multi-hop questions (Li and\nGoyal, 2025)) to isolate reasoning from knowl-\nedge, but such benchmarks are often artificial and\ndomain-constrained. Notably, Li and Goyal (2025)\nanalyzes the synergy between knowledge and rea-\nsoning as knowledge evolves, offering a perspec-\ntive complementary to our controlled CoT SFT\nexperiments. Another line of work trains exter-\nnal classifiers to label questions as reasoning- or\nknowledge-intensive based on parametric mod-\nels (Thapa et al., 2025). However, this approach\nrequires well-calibrated training data and does not\nconsider the tested model\u2019s internal knowledge;\nfor instance, a question labeled as requiring rea-\nsoning might be directly memorized by the model.\nConcurrent work leverages reasoning traces to eval-\nuate factual correctness (Wu et al., 2025), but fo-\ncuses on surface-level factuality rather than gen-\nuine knowledge recall. With KRUX, we extract\nanswer-agnostic, atomic knowledge points directly\nfrom models\u2019 reasoning traces and evaluate their\neffect under controlled availability. Unlike prior\nwork that trains external classifiers to label ques-\ntion types or checks surface factuality in traces,\nKRUX holds knowledge constant and varies the\ntarget model, isolating knowledge recall from rea-\nsoning ability without relying on heuristic difficulty\ntags. Additional related work is provided in Ap-\npendix A.\n3\nBenchmarking Knowledge-Intensive\nScientific Reasoning\nGiven limited coverage in terms of domain, for-\nmats, or accessibility for individual benchmarks,\nSCIREAS solves this by merging ten datasets under\none standardized harness, offering broad domain\ncoverage and consistent evaluation.\nSCIREAS\nSCIREAS is a unified evaluation suite\nfocused on reasoning-intensive scientific tasks cu-\nrated from 10 representative existing benchmarks.\nThrough task-level filtering, SCIREAS reduces in-\nstance count by nearly 50% while preserving cov-\nerage, and, inspired by OLMES (Gu et al., 2025),\nprovides a unified implementation optimized with\nvLLM (Kwon et al., 2023) and batch job APIs2 for\nscalable, easy-to-use, and efficient evaluation.\nOur curation prioritizes subtasks from each\nbenchmark that demand not only specific domain\nknowledge but also complex, multi-step reasoning\nprocesses for resolution. For each subtask from\neach benchmark, we manually inspect at least 20\ninstances. We manually determine (1) whether the\ngiven task requires an in-depth understanding of\ndomain-specific scientific knowledge beyond the\ninformation provided in-context, and (2) whether\nmulti-step reasoning is necessary to reach the cor-\nrect answer. We incorporate tasks only if all 20\nsampled instances fulfill both requirements.3\nTo keep evaluation cost-efficient under compute\nconstraints, we uniformly sample 200 instances\nfrom each subtask sourced from high-cost bench-\nmarks \u2014 MMLU-Pro, SciKnowEval, SciEval, and\n2We provide batch job inference options for popular LLM\nproviders, e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, TogetherAI, and Gemini.\nUsing batch APIs allows for up to 50% cost reduction.\n3While this manual inspection can be subjective, the judg-\nment is based on the authors\u2019 graduate-school-level expertise.\n3\n\n$1.0\n$10\n$100\nCost per 1k instances (USD, log scale)\n0.525\n0.550\n0.575\n0.600\n0.625\n0.650\n0.675\n0.700\nSciReas Performance (Avg)\nFamilies\nDeepSeek V3/R1\nGemini 2.5 Pro\no3\nQwen3 32B\no3 Mini\nClaude Sonnet 4\nGPT 4.1\no4 Mini\nGrok3\nGrok3 Mini\nLlama 4 Maverick\nGPT OSS 120B\nGPT 5\nVariant\nHigh/Thinking\nLow/Non-Thinking\nFigure 2: Frontier reasoning models\u2019 performance evaluated on SCIREAS.

The complete list of selected subtasks,\ntheir subject coverage, data sources, and evalua-\ntion metrics appears in Appendix B.1. Benchmarks\naffected by our filtering are marked with an aster-\nisk (*); their scores are not directly comparable to\nthose from prior work.\nSCIREAS-PRO\nAlthough SCIREAS provides a\nuniform measurement for model performance on\nscientific reasoning tasks that nominally require\nscientific reasoning, the difficulty of individual in-\nstances is uneven: some can be answered with little\nor no deductive effort once the pertinent fact is\nrecalled, as shown in an example in Figure 3.\nTo isolate the reasoning skill, we therefore cu-\nrate a \u201chard\u201d subset \u2014 those questions whose solu-\ntions still demand multi-step inference even when\nall relevant knowledge is available \u2014 so that any\nperformance gains cannot be explained by knowl-\nedge recall alone. Building on our observation in\n\u00a73.1.1, we hypothesize that the performance dif-\nference under different test-time inference budgets\ncan serve as an effective indicator of reasoning\nintensity. Specifically, instances where reasoning\nmodels fail with low reasoning budget but succeed\nwith high budget likely require complex reasoning\nprocesses, even when the necessary domain knowl-\nedge is accessible to the model in both settings.\nIn practice, we evaluate o3-mini and o4-mini on\nSCIREAS with both high and low \u201creasoning-effort\u201d\nsettings \u2014 an OpenAI API flag that limits the num-\nber of thinking tokens before the answer. For o3-\nmini and o4-mini, the high-effort setting costs at\nleast 5.8\u00d7 more per instance than the low-effort\nsetting (Table 6, Appendix B.1).4 For each model,\nwe keep questions answered incorrectly under low\neffort but correctly under high effort and take the\n4Because these models are proprietary, factors beyond the\nflag may influence performance.

We evaluate\nfrontier models using different \u201creasoning-effort\u201d\nsettings (see configuration details in Appendix C).\nThese settings typically correspond to significant\ndifferences in output length, with high-effort modes\nproducing substantially more reasoning tokens as\nthey work through complex problems. 5\n3.1.1\nResults\nAggregated Results\nFigure 2 highlights aggre-\ngated performance and rankings evaluated on\nSCIREAS, with score breakdowns on selected mod-\nels shown in Table 6. Notably, the aggregated\nranking provides additional insights that differ\nfrom popular individual benchmarks. Compar-\ning o3-High and Gemini-2.5-Pro-Preview-High as\nan example, o3-High wins on GPQA and MMLU-\nPro* while Gemini-2.5-Pro-Preview-High wins on\nSuperGPQA*, all with a thin margin (within 1 ab-\nsolute point, even evaluated on MMLU-Pro before\nuniform sampling as shown in Figure 7). Simi-\nlarly, GPT-5-High shows on-par performance with\n5In this work, we refer to DeepSeek-R1-0528 and\nDeepSeek-V3-0324 simply as DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-\nV3, respectively, unless otherwise specified.\nGemini-2.5-Pro-Preview-High on problem-solving\nbenchmarks like OlympiadBench and SciRIFF.\nEvaluated across SCIREAS, however, we notice\nthat GPT-5-High outperforms its competitors on a\nbroader range of benchmarks. Meanwhile, o3-High\nachieves higher overall performance over Gemini-\n2.5-Pro-Preview-High, with superior performance\non LabBench* and weaker on OlympiadBench by\na large margin (beyond 10 absolute points).\nBenchmark Correlations\nIn general, as the Pear-\nson correlation analysis shows in Figure 4 (a),\nwhile some benchmarks are closely correlated (e.g.,\nGPQA and SuperGPQA*), benchmarks containing\nfree-form QA and fill-in-the-blank questions like\nSciRIFF* and SciEval* are not highly correlated\nwith GPQA-like multiple-choice tasks, demonstrat-\ning the need for a holistic evaluation suite.\nIsolating specific benchmarks, we observe that\nmodels from different providers may be tuned\nexplicitly for specific tasks or skills. As shown in\nFigure 4 (b) and (c), Qwen3-32B-Thinking strikes\nnoticeably above the trend on SciBench, reaching\ncomparable performance to commercial frontier\nmodels. Similarly, DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-\nR1-0120 demonstrate stronger performance on\nMMLU-Pro*, indicating capabilities that surpass\ntheir overall rankings.\nPerformance Gap by Reasoning Difference\nAl-\nthough the gap varies depending on different model\nfamilies and providers, the same model can ex-\nhibit a significant performance gap under differ-\nent reasoning settings. For instance, as shown in\nFigure 2, o3-mini-Low and -High show a perfor-\nmance gap of 6.8 on the aggregated average. Simi-\nlar traits can be observed among o4-mini, Claude-\nSonnet-4, and o3, while Gemini-2.5-Pro shows\nthe least performance gain, even with significantly\n5\n\n\nGPT-5\no3\nClaude-Sonnet-4\nDeepSeek-V3/R1-0528\nGemini-2.5-Pro-Preview\nGPT-4.1\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\nAccuracy (%)\n70\n72\n+3.0 +12.2\n68\n65\n+2.2\n+11.6\n62\n39\n+1.8\n+5.8\n65\n44\n+7.2\n+13.9\n67\n64\n+2.3\n59\n25\nBenchmark Type & Reasoning Level\nSciReasBench\nSciReasBench-Pro\nBase performance\nReasoning gain\nFigure 5:\nModel performance on SCIREAS and\nSCIREAS-PRO with varying reasoning capabilities.\nSCIREAS-PRO amplifies gaps between low-/non-\nreasoning and high-reasoning settings.\nmore (>10\u00d7) thinking budget.\nThis observation motivates the construction of\nSCIREAS-PRO, leveraging the performance gap be-\ntween low and high reasoning efforts as an effective\nproxy for identifying instances that demand com-\nplex reasoning rather than mere knowledge recall.\nFor practitioners, task-specific evaluation is still\nrecommended for the optimal balance between\ninference cost and performance.\nAmplified Performance Gap\nAs shown in\nFigure 5, SCIREAS-PRO amplifies performance\ngaps between low- and high-reasoning settings,\nwhere the gap between GPT-5-High and GPT-5-\nLow widens from 3.01 to 12.22, and the corre-\nsponding gap for Gemini-2.5-Pro-Preview widens\nfrom 0.35 to 2.30. Meanwhile, non-reasoning mod-\nels, e.g., GPT-4.1, DeepSeek-V3, show more signif-\nicant gaps on SCIREAS-PRO compared to concur-\nrent reasoning models, i.e., o3 and DeepSeek-R1,\nrespectively.\n4\nDisentangling Knowledge and\nReasoning in Scientific Tasks\nWhile SCIREAS and SCIREAS-PRO provide uni-\nfied benchmarks to evaluate scientific reasoning\ncapabilities, another fundamental question remains\nunanswered: how does CoT reasoning adapta-\ntion affect a model\u2019s ability to recall and utilize\nknowledge? To address this question, we first con-\nduct a series of controlled SFT experiments on\nhigh-quality reasoning traces with and without in-\ndomain scientific knowledge, and then we propose\nKRUX, a novel investigative framework to study\nthree key research questions regarding the role of\nknowledge in scientific reasoning using the fine-\ntuned checkpoints.\nModel\nMethod\nSCIREAS\n-PRO\nOur Checkpoints\nQwen\n\u2013\n37.07\n13.97\nQwen-STEM\nSFT\n40.47\n16.11\nQwen-Math\nSFT\n41.99\n18.17\nQwen-BOTH\nSFT\n42.84\n21.11\nLlama\n\u2013\n31.25\n11.67\nLlama-STEM\nSFT\n35.28\n14.29\nLlama-Math\nSFT\n35.49\n16.98\nLlama-BOTH\nSFT\n38.55\n16.51\nConcurrent Reasoning Post-training\nSYNTHETIC-1-SFT\nSFT\n37.64\n19.44\nOpenR1\nSFT\n43.08\n26.43\nLlama-Nemotron\nSFT&RL\n43.53\n23.75\nGeneral-Reasoner\nRL\n34.99\n13.73\nTable 1: Performance of reasoning models trained\nfrom Qwen2.5-Instruct and Llama-3.1-Instruct on\nSYNTHETIC-1 and concurrent reasoning models.\n4.1\nControlled CoT SFT\nTo control for data composition and isolate the\nimpact of reasoning and knowledge injection\nduring post-training, we fine-tune Qwen2.5-7B-\nInstruct (Yang et al., 2024) and Llama-3.1-8B-\nInstruct (Grattafiori et al., 2024) on reasoning traces\ndrawn from mathematics and STEM domains, as\nwell as on their combination. This allows us to at-\ntribute behavior changes to the data mixture rather\nthan confounding factors.\nFor training, we leverage the SYNTHETIC-\n1 (Mattern et al., 2025) dataset, an existing large-\nscale dataset released by Prime Intellect,6 which\nconsists of outputs of DeepSeek-R1-0120, includ-\ning the reasoning traces, on a diverse set of tasks.\nMore specifically, we leverage the mathematics\nand STEM subsets from SYNTHETIC-1 (denoted\nas SYNTHETIC-1-Math/STEM, respectively). The\nformer provides reasoning traces on abstract math\nreasoning questions, serving as a source for long\nCoT adaptation without introducing in-domain\nknowledge. In contrast, the latter is sourced from\nStackExchange (Lambert et al., 2023), providing\na more in-domain data source for a broader range\nof scientific subjects.7 The math subset contains\naround 462K instances, while the STEM subset\ncontains around 512K instances. Details of the\ntraining and evaluation setup are in Appendix D.\nBy\ntraining\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct\non\n6https://huggingface.co/PrimeIntellect\n7Notably,\nSYNTHETIC-1-Math\nis\nsourced\nfrom\ncompetition-level\nmath\nproblems,\nhighlighting\nhigh-\nquality abstract math reasoning filtered by verified answers. In\ncontrast, StackExchange and SYNTHETIC-1-STEM provide\nmore realistic problem-solving data from wider subjects,\noffering more coverage in science domains.\n6\n\nSYNTHETIC-1 (-Math, -STEM, and the combined\nsubsets), we derived Qwen-Math, Qwen-STEM,\nand Qwen-BOTH along with their counterparts\ntrained from Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. In the follow-\ning, we will refer to the base models as Qwen or\nLlama for brevity. Compared with concurrent work\non long CoT post-training (Bercovich et al., 2025a;\nFace, 2025; Mattern et al., 2025; Ma et al., 2025b),\nour checkpoints deliver comparable performance\nunder controlled settings (Table 1), serving as\nreliable investigating checkpoints.\n4.2\nKnowledge & Reasoning Utilization Exam\n(KRUX)\nWe introduce KRUX (Figure 1), a novel inves-\ntigative framework to study the role of knowledge\nand long CoT reasoning in scientific problem solv-\ning. To separate what a model knows from how\nit reasons, we hold knowledge availability fixed\nby injecting compact, answer-agnostic knowledge\ningredients (KIs) in-context. In the framework, we\nextract KIs from the reasoning traces of various\nmodels and provide these KIs in-context to LLMs\nwhen evaluating them. Consequently, gains over a\nno-KI baseline indicate a knowledge-retrieval bot-\ntleneck, while persistent errors point to reasoning\nlimits.\nWe first introduce our pipeline to extract KIs\nfrom reasoning traces (\u00a74.2.1), and then dis-\ncuss how we analyze and apply extracted KIs to\ntest knowledge recall (\u00a74.2.2, \u00a74.2.4) and usage\n(\u00a74.2.3). For experiments, we prioritize challeng-\ning benchmarks (i.e., GPQA, MMLU-Pro*, and\nLabBench*), which have been widely used by pre-\nvious work in the field on tasks that require scien-\ntific expertise.\n4.2.1\nKnowledge Ingredient (KI) Extraction\nFirst, to analyze the role of knowledge in models\u2019\nperformance on scientific problem-solving, we aim\nto study a setting in which the model is given the\nrequisite knowledge in-context. Specifically, we\ntake the reasoning traces from a reasoning model as\nthe knowledge source and use a strong reasoning-\nfocused LLM (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) to extract the\nessential atomic knowledge units that comprise it,\nwhich we refer to as knowledge ingredients (KIs)\n(Figure 1). We provide the extraction prompt and\nexample KIs in Appendix E.1. We then augment\nthe original question by prepending the extracted\nKIs in-context and ask the models to solve the same\nproblem.\nWe perform additional checks to ensure that KIs\nare relevant to the problem and do not leak any\npart of the final answer. In manual review, all ex-\ntracted KIs met these criteria and were consistent\nwith their source reasoning traces. To prevent the\nextractor from hallucinating or introducing extra-\nneous facts (i.e., KIs unsupported by the source\ntrace or unnecessary for solving the problem), we\nfeed the generated KIs back to the source model\nand measure performance. If performance changes\nmaterially, this indicates potential leakage of steps\nor answers. Empirically, we observe no signifi-\ncant change (Table 2, Base vs. w/ Base KIs), sug-\ngesting the KIs are answer-agnostic and faithful\nto the trace. Further, although it is possible that\nthe knowledge pieces may be irrelevant to the so-\nlution, as shown in recent studies of CoT faithful-\nness (Turpin et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024c,a),\nrecent high-performing models like DeepSeek-R1\nhave demonstrated strong reasoning adherence on\nbenchmark tasks (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025). Our\nexperiments show that the knowledge pieces help\nmodels on reasoning tasks. See Figures 12-14 in\nAppendix E.1 for KI examples generated by differ-\nent models for the same question.\nCentered on our primary research objective on\nthe roles of knowledge recall and utilization in rea-\nsoning models, we examine the following key re-\nsearch questions: RQ1: To what extent can base\nmodels benefit from high-quality external knowl-\nedge? RQ2: Do reasoning-enhanced models bene-\nfit from external knowledge? RQ3: Does reason-\ning fine-tuning improve a model\u2019s ability to surface\nhelpful knowledge?\n4.2.2\nRQ1: To what extent can base models\nbenefit from high-quality external\nknowledge?\nProblem Statement.\nWe investigate the potential\nimprovement from external knowledge by provid-\ning KIs to the base models in the prompt when\nperforming scientific reasoning (Figure 1). Here,\nwe focus on two sources for the KIs, which are ex-\ntracted from their own CoT traces (w/ Base KIs) or\nfrom DeepSeek-R1\u2019s CoT traces (w/ R1 KIs). To\novercome context sensitivity, we report averages\nand standard deviations across 5 runs with corre-\nsponding KIs permuted randomly. We then investi-\ngate whether there are significant gaps between\nbase models augmented with additional KIs in\nthe context, and their corresponding reasoning-\nfine-tuned models. To this end, comparisons are\n7\n\nSetup\nGPQA\nLabBench*\nQwen\n35.27\n32.38\nw/ Qwen KIs\n34.24 \u00b1 0.93\n30.93 \u00b1 1.43\nw/ R1 KIs\n47.19 \u00b1 1.53\n41.40 \u00b1 2.46\nQwen-STEM\n41.63\n31.75\nQwen-Math\n39.47\n30.18\nQwen-BOTH\n40.81\n33.83\nGeneral-Reasoner\n35.94\n35.58\nLlama\n28.13\n33.55\nw/ Llama KIs\n29.06 \u00b1 1.44\n34.40 \u00b1 2.58\nw/ R1 KIs\n43.57 \u00b1 0.88\n42.27 \u00b1 1.60\nLlama-STEM\n38.95\n36.04\nLlama-Math\n36.16\n34.78\nLlama-BOTH\n39.43\n36.61\nLlama-Nemotron\n37.95\n27.78\nTable 2: Performance on GPQA and LabBench* with\nbase models alone, base models with knowledge ex-\ntracted from DeepSeek-R1 or itself (w/ {R1, Base} KIs),\nand base models with reasoning-fine-tuning. Best and\nsecond best average scores are labeled in bold and un-\nderlined, respectively. Reasoning models fall behind\nbase models augmented with in-context knowledge.\nmade with reasoning-fine-tuned models trained on\nour controlled data mixtures and the ones from con-\ncurrent work (i.e., General-Reasoner-7B (Liu et al.,\n2025) and Llama-Nemotron-Nano-8B (Bercovich\net al., 2025b)) that involve SFT and reinforce-\nment learning based on the same base models (i.e.,\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct,\nrespectively).\nAnswer to RQ1: As an upper bound, a base\nmodel with high-quality in-context knowledge\ncan substantially outperform its reasoning-\nenhanced counterpart.\nAs shown in Table 2,\nbase models provided with KIs from DeepSeek-\nR1 are able to outperform base models alone or\nBase w/ Base KIs setup by \u226520%, and outperform\nreasoning variants without KIs by \u226510% across\ndifferent benchmarks and model families, showing\nthe external knowledge provides greater gain than\nreasoning fine-tuning. The fact that a base model\nwithout strong reasoning capabilities can outper-\nform reasoning models in this setting indicates a\npotential deficiency of the models in knowledge\nrecall that hinders their performance in scientific\nreasoning.\n4.2.3\nRQ2: Do reasoning-enhanced models\nbenefit from external knowledge?\nProblem Statement.\nObserving considerable im-\nprovements from adding external knowledge ingre-\ndients from DeepSeek-R1 to base models in RQ1,\nwe hypothesize similar improvements would scale\non reasoning-enhanced models, offering additional\ngains on top of enhanced reasoning capabilities. To\nthis end, we evaluate base and CoT SFTed vari-\nants on KIs extracted from DeepSeek-R1, provid-\ning the same necessary knowledge extracted from\nDeepSeek-R1\u2019s reasoning traces (w/ R1 KIs). As\nthe baseline for comparison that is not provided\nwith added knowledge, we instead offer the tested\nmodels with KIs extracted from their own CoT\ntraces (w/ self KIs).\nAnswer to RQ2: Yes. the reasoning models also\nsubstantially benefit from addition of contex-\ntual knowledge.\nAs shown in Table 3, within\nboth Qwen and Llama groups, reasoning-enhanced\nmodels w/ R1 KIs in the context show significant\nimprovements over the base setting without the KIs,\nwhile preserving the gap compared with the base\nmodel w/ R1 KIs. Confirming the effectiveness\nof providing external knowledge as an in-context\nprompt, this result sheds light on potential future\nimprovement by applying high-quality external\nmemory modules as an external knowledge source\nfor better problem-solving capabilities, echoing the\nfinding in COMPACTDB (Lyu et al., 2025), a con-\ncurrent effort constructing a high-quality datastore\nfor reasoning-intensive tasks.\nWe note, however, that in these experiments,\nwe do not distinguish between two possible non-\nexclusive explanations for the improvement from\nadding R1 KIs. (a) It may be that the R1 KIs pro-\nvide new key knowledge absent from the model\u2019s\nparameters, or (b) the model may already possess\nthese facts but struggle to retrieve them (put another\nway, once a strong reasoning model supplies the\nkey facts, the reasoning search space might narrow\nand the problem becomes easier, whether or not the\nmodel originally \u201cknew\u201d the augmented facts). We\nfurther analyze this confounder in RQ3.\n4.2.4\nRQ3: Does reasoning fine-tuning\nimprove a model\u2019s ability to surface\nhelpful knowledge?\nProblem Statement.\nWhile we observe that ex-\nternal knowledge benefits reasoning models, in\nthis RQ, we ask how reasoning-fine-tuning affects\nknowledge recall. To this end, we focus on eval-\nuating the KIs from -Math models to determine\nwhether they offer more more improvement than\nthose of base models, since -Math models are fine-\ntuned on math-only data without additional scien-\ntific knowledge.\nNotably, in Table 2, while -STEM and -BOTH\n8\n\nGPQA\nMMLU-Pro*\nLabBench*\nModels\nw/ self KIs\nw/ R1 KIs\nw/ self KIs\nw/ R1 KIs\nw/ self KIs\nw/ R1 KIs\nQwen\n34.24 \u00b1 0.93\n47.19 \u00b1 1.53\n59.03 \u00b1 0.34\n68.86 \u00b1 0.56\n30.93 \u00b1 1.43\n41.40 \u00b1 2.46\nQwen-STEM\n41.63 \u00b1 2.10\n52.50 \u00b1 2.14\n64.71 \u00b1 1.05\n69.69 \u00b1 0.73\n31.75 \u00b1 2.81\n43.79 \u00b1 1.71\nQwen-Math\n39.47 \u00b1 1.66\n53.53 \u00b1 1.24\n66.93 \u00b1 0.72\n74.00 \u00b1 0.59\n30.18 \u00b1 1.65\n41.17 \u00b1 2.32\nQwen-BOTH\n40.81 \u00b1 2.04\n54.46 \u00b1 1.27\n65.71 \u00b1 0.74\n71.64 \u00b1 1.16\n33.83 \u00b1 2.59\n43.90 \u00b1 2.71\nLlama\n29.06 \u00b1 1.44\n43.57 \u00b1 0.88\n47.73 \u00b1 0.89\n60.53 \u00b1 1.67\n34.40 \u00b1 2.58\n42.27 \u00b1 1.60\nLlama-STEM\n38.95 \u00b1 1.31\n53.17 \u00b1 1.15\n59.14 \u00b1 0.85\n68.19 \u00b1 1.15\n36.04 \u00b1 3.98\n46.87 \u00b1 1.49\nLlama-Math\n36.16 \u00b1 2.33\n53.75 \u00b1 1.15\n59.65 \u00b1 0.98\n69.01 \u00b1 0.55\n34.78 \u00b1 4.26\n45.55 \u00b1 0.68\nLlama-BOTH\n39.43 \u00b1 2.00\n54.73 \u00b1 1.75\n63.81 \u00b1 0.90\n72.74 \u00b1 0.26\n36.61 \u00b1 2.73\n48.65 \u00b1 0.49\nTable 3: Accuracy of Qwen and Llama variants on benchmarks with external knowledge ingredients (KIs).

Base models and math reasoning-fine-\ntuned models show similar performance on knowledge\nrecall questions, demonstrating no explicit in-domain\nknowledge injection.\nvariants, trained with SYNTHETIC-1-STEM, out-\nperform -Math variants due to science in-domain\ntraining data, -Math variants also largely outper-\nform the base model even without being trained\non science data. Recalling our discussion in RQ2\n(\u00a74.2.3), the -Math model\u2019s gains have the same\ntwo non-exclusive explanations, (a) some science\nquestions require mathematical knowledge, and\nthe -Math model performs better on these because\nmath knowledge was loaded into the model through\nthe math-specific fine-tuning, and/or (b) the -Math\nmodel is better at surfacing its relevant parametric\nknowledge via CoT expression.\nTo disentangle these two factors, we extract KIs\nfrom the CoTs of the -Math models and examine\nwhether these KIs represent new knowledge added\nby fine-tuning, or whether they are also facts known\nto the base model. We probe this by querying the\nmodel with synthetic questions that test knowledge\nof each KI (see Appendix E.2 for prompts and\nexamples). Then, to verify explanation (b), we\nprovide the KIs in-context from either the -Math or\nbase model, to the corresponding base model; i.e.,\nholding mathematical reasoning capacity constant\nwhile varying only the external knowledge.\nBase Setup\nGPQA\nMMLU-Pro*\nQwen\nw/ Qwen KIs\n34.24 \u00b1 0.93 59.03 \u00b1 0.34\nw/ Qwen-Math KIs 36.93 \u00b1 1.75 63.66 \u00b1 0.45\nLlama\nw/ Llama KIs\n29.06 \u00b1 1.44 47.73 \u00b1 0.89\nw/ Llama-Math KIs 29.69 \u00b1 1.72 53.91 \u00b1 0.94\nTable 5: Performance on GPQA and MMLU-Pro* with\nKIs extracted from base and -Math reasoning models.\nKIs extracted from -Math models enable more improve-\nment over those from base models.\nAnswer to RQ3: Yes.\nIn response to explanation\n(a), we find that on average, the base models and\ntheir corresponding -Math variants have similar re-\ncall of the KIs (Table 4), meaning that explanation\n(a) is unlikely to be the major contributor for the\nimprovements.\nTo verify explanation (b), Table 5 shows that KIs\nfrom -Math deliver significant boosts over those\nfrom the base models across different benchmarks\nand model families. This result suggests that CoT\nverbalization improves the model\u2019s ability to iden-\ntify and surface the most relevant latent knowledge\nfor the given reasoning problems. Notably, the KIs\nare unlikely to have been newly acquired during\nfine-tuning (Table 4); instead, the findings indicate\nthat reasoning-fine-tuned models exhibit improved\nrecall of knowledge already parameterized in the\nbase model.\n5\nTraining Knowledge Enhanced\nScientific Reasoning Models\nOur analyses conducted so far are based on\nmodels fine-tuned on either SYNTHETIC-1-Math,\nSYNTHETIC-1-STEM, or both, while combining\nthe two, which cover both STEM and mathematical\nreasoning, achieves the strongest performance. To\nfurther assess the effectiveness of this Math+STEM\n9\n\ndata mixture following \u00a74.1, we compare it di-\nrectly against concurrently released long-CoT SFT\ndatasets on the same base model. We then ap-\nply the same mixture to Qwen3-8B-Base to obtain\nSCILIT01 to provide a stronger baseline.\nSpecifically, we compare Qwen-BOTH, which\nis fine-tuned using our training recipe, with\nSYNTHETIC-1-SFT (Mattern et al., 2025), a model\nfine-tuned on SYNTHETIC-1 with additional cod-\ning and preference alignment data, and Qwen-\nNemotron, a model we trained with the same\nsettings and same amount of data (\u00a74.1) sam-\npled from science and math domains of Llama-\nNemotron (Bercovich et al., 2025b), a training data\nmixture for reasoning fine-tuning, all post-trained\non Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. The results in Table 10\nshow that our data composition yields a stronger\nbaseline for scientific reasoning than concurrent\ndata recipes on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (Table 10\ncenter block), and Qwen-BOTH reaches compara-\nble performance to models from concurrent efforts\nfocusing on reasoning enhancement post-training\nrecipes (Table 10 left-hand block, i.e., OpenR1\n(Face, 2025), Llama-Nemotron (Bercovich et al.,\n2025b), and General-Reasoner (Ma et al., 2025b)).\nFurthermore, using our recipe, we fine-tune\nthe recently released Qwen3-8B-Base to deliver\na stronger model, SCILIT01. While its perfor-\nmance falls behind Qwen3-8B with the thinking\nmode, which has undergone more sophisticated\npost-training, it outperforms Qwen3-8B with non-\nthinking mode (Table 10 right-hand block). This\nindicates that SCILIT01 partially unleashes the rea-\nsoning capabilities from the base model, offering\na strong baseline for future study on post-training\nrecipe for scientific reasoning.\n6\nConclusion\nIn this work, we studied how reasoning and do-\nmain knowledge each contribute to scientific rea-\nsoning in large language models.\nTo this end,\nwe introduced SCIREAS, a unified, reproducible\nsuite for evaluating scientific reasoning across\ndomains and formats, and SCIREAS-PRO, its\nreasoning-intensive subset. With our evaluation\nsuite, we show that despite the universal applica-\nbility of modern LLMs, different LLMs can have\ndistinct strengths, and differences in inference bud-\nget could lead to a significant performance gap on\nthe same model. Therefore, we recommend that\npractitioners conduct task-specific evaluations to\nachieve an optimal balance between cost and per-\nformance in real-life use cases.\nWe also introduced KRUX, a knowledge-\ncontrolled evaluation framework that assesses\nLLMs with provided knowledge ingredients (KIs),\nrevealing important insights regarding the en-\nhanced knowledge utilization and recall enabled\nby reasoning-fine-tuning. We showed: (i) retriev-\ning task-relevant knowledge from parameters is a\nkey bottleneck \u2014 base instruct models can sur-\npass reasoning-tuned models once supplied with\nhigh-quality KIs; (ii) reasoning-fine-tuned models\nstill benefit from the same external KIs, suggesting\ncomplementary gains from explicit knowledge ac-\ncess; and (iii) verbalized CoT improves knowledge\nsurfacing \u2014 KIs extracted from math-only reason-\ning models help the corresponding base models\nmore than base-derived KIs, even when no new\ndomain knowledge is introduced. Our results show\nthat reasoning-focused fine-tuning improves both\nreasoning and knowledge use, suggesting promis-\ning future directions in better understanding and\nenhancing these interconnected components.\nLimitations\nOur KRUX framework and KI extraction meth-\nods depend on strong models like DeepSeek-\nR1 for generating reasoning traces.\nWhile we\nused an open-weight model, which provides more\ntransparency and interpretability, the KI extrac-\ntion pipeline may introduce unobservable biases\n(though risk is minimal due to our focus on scien-\ntific domains), unwanted leakage of information\nabout the answer, or inconsistencies in the faithful-\nness of the KIs to the task. To mitigate this, we\nconducted manual analysis of the KIs, confirming\ntheir relevance and no direct answer leakage, but\nextracted KIs could occasionally be irrelevant or\nincomplete, especially if deployed at scale. Fur-\nthermore, some of our analyses are confounded by\nfactors such as context sensitivity (addressed via\npermutations) and the impact of constraining the\nsearch space when providing KIs, which we inter-\npret as an upper bound but may overestimate pure\nrecall benefits. We have taken measures to mitigate\nthese and discussed the caveats in our discussion\nof results with more details.\nOur experiments focus on moderate-sized LLMs\nwith <10B parameters, specifically open-weight\nmodels (Qwen2.5, Llama3.1). While we delib-\nerately selected two model families and models\n10\n\nlarge enough to exhibit non-trivial reasoning per-\nformance, this limits the generalizability of our\nfindings to larger models.\nExperimenting with\nlarger models represents a straightforward exten-\nsion but requires significantly greater computa-\ntional resources, beyond the scope of our current\nstudy and our available compute resources.\nThe benchmarks we examine emphasize STEM\nfields, which may underrepresent interdisciplinary\nor emerging scientific research areas. We acknowl-\nedge potential data contamination issues that may\nimpact our analysis; however, the nature of our\nstudy is analytical, and we perform controlled ex-\nperiments. In our benchmarks, we also mitigate\nthese concerns by focusing on recent 2024\u20132025\ndatasets. Despite these constraints, our methodol-\nogy provides a systematic framework for evaluating\ndomain-specific reasoning that can be extended to\naddress these limitations in future work.\nAcknowledgments\nThis project was supported in part by Google\u2019s\nResearch Scholar Program and compute credits\nfrom Nvidia through Nvidia\u2019s academic grants pro-\ngram.

Instead of general knowledge evalua-\ntion, recent work approaches the knowledge fron-\ntier of LLMs by anchoring on specific entities,\nproposing methods to quantify knowledge and fac-\ntuality around given entities (Gottesman and Geva,\n2024; Cohen et al., 2023). With recent development\nof reasoning LLMs, more work exploits long CoT\ntraces as evidence of explicit knowledge utiliza-\ntion, verifying knowledge recall in CoT traces for\nfactuality (Wu et al., 2025). Nevertheless, directly\nevaluating CoT traces can result in false positive\nsignals on the knowledge boundary, given that the\nknowledge involved could be factual but not help-\nful for problem solving (Arcuschin et al., 2025).\nIn our framework, we construct controlled settings\nand protocols to evaluate whether the knowledge is\ngenuinely helpful for problem-solving, implicitly\nguaranteeing the factuality and relevance.\nReasoning LLMs\nRecent work has shown that\nLLMs can be trained to utilize intermediate tokens\nfor reasoning, achieving better performance on rea-\nsoning tasks as the decoding budget increases. Ope-\nnAI\u2019s o-series (OpenAI et al., 2024) represents the\nlandmark of this paradigm among commercial fron-\ntier models, followed by DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-\nAI et al., 2025) and several recent efforts to re-\nproduce this success without releasing the training\ndata, such as QwQ (Team, 2025) and Kimi (Team\net al., 2025a).\nSome recent initiatives aim to\nachieve the same goal using fully open data sources,\nled by Llama-Nemotron from NVIDIA (Bercovich\net al., 2025b) and SYNTHETIC-1 from Prime Intel-\nlect (Mattern et al., 2025), releasing post-training\ndata to foster development within the community.\nOur work builds on these commitments, sharing the\nvision of improving model reasoning by leveraging\nintermediate tokens, while emphasizing our focus\non scientific domains rather than on mathematics\nor general logical reasoning.\nLLMs for Science\nRecent advancements in sci-\nentific LLMs have transitioned from early domain-\nspecific pretraining (e.g., Beltagy et al. 2019; Lee\n14\n\net al. 2020), to more comprehensive models with\nmultiple stages of training, e.g., SciGLM (Zhang\net al., 2024), SciLitLLM (Li et al., 2025), and Om-\nniScience (Prabhakar et al., 2025). On the other\nhand, reasoning models have shown strong per-\nformance on scientific tasks such as GPQA and\nMMLU-Pro (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025; OpenAI\net al., 2024), and some recent efforts instrument\nLLMs to separate recall from deduction during in-\nference (Wang et al., 2025; Jin et al., 2025). How-\never, we still lack a clear understanding of the fac-\ntors underlying performance on scientific tasks,\nsuch as knowledge acquisition or improved rea-\nsoning capabilities. We aim to address this gap by\nstudying these factors and then providing a recipe\nfor training more capable models in science.\nB\nSCIREAS Details\nB.1\nEvaluation Suite Curation\nSee Table 11-12 for domain distribution.

As shown in Figure 1, for\neach reasoning model, we categorize each test\nquestion from SCIREAS by their correctness un-\nder low/high reasoning efforts into four categories,\n(high_c, low_c), (high_c, low_i), (high_i,\nlow_c), and (high_i, low_i), where high/low\nstands for high/low reasoning effort setting and\n*_c/*_i stands for the problem instance has been\n16\n\nanswered correctly/incorrectly by the model. Treat-\ning (high_c, low_i) as targeting instances that\nrequire high reasoning effort, we measure how\n(high_c, low_i) sets derived from different rea-\nsoning models agree with others.\nAs shown in Table 7, treating (high_c, low_i)\nfrom o3-mini as ground truth, the same set derived\nfrom o4-mini, o3, and claude-sonnet-4 largely co-\nincide with o3-mini across different benchmarks\nfrom SCIREAS (all above 70%), showing high\nagreement on instances that require high reasoning\nefforts across models from different model fami-\nlies.\nGround Truth\no3-mini o3-mini\no3-mini\nvs.\nvs.\nvs.\nTarget\no4-mini\no3\nclaude-sonnet-4\nSuperGPQA*\n78.0\n77.8\n76.1\nGPQA\n80.4\n81.0\n79.0\nMMLU-Pro*\n92.2\n91.6\n92.0\nLabBench*\n71.9\n74.6\n75.8\nSciBench\n75.9\n74.1\n75.4\nOlympiadBench\n81.1\n81.5\n81.2\nSciEval*\n94.3\n93.1\n93.5\nUGPhysics*\n83.2\n82.9\n83.8\nTable 7: Accuracy of overlapping instances on (high_c,\nlow_i) from o3-mini vs. other models, treating o3-mini\nas ground true label.

The LLM judge is based on GPT-4.1 for a\nbalanced tradeoff between assessment reliability\nand cost. Notably, naively prompting the LLM\njudge to determine the reasoning difficulty could\nbe suboptimal due to a lack of reference. There-\nfore, we designed two reference-based evaluation\nprotocols: (a) pair-wise comparison on reasoning\ndifficulty between instance questions sampled from\nfiltered subset and original SCIREAS, and (b) iden-\ntifying failing reason for filtered instances given\nlow and high reasoning outputs (i.e., whether the\nmodel fails in a low reasoning setting due to lack\nof reasoning effort).\n(a) Pairwise Comparison\nFor each instance in\nSCIREAS-PRO, the judge is also presented with\nan instance drawn from the set of other, non-\noverlapping instances from SCIREAS.

In practice, the reasoning traces are en-\nclosed by keywords <think> and </think>, indi-\ncating the start and the end of the reasoning process.\nThe model is trained with the standard SFT ob-\njective: L(\u03b8) = \u2212\u03a3(x,y)\u2208D\u03a3|y|\nt=1 log p\u03b8(yt|y<t, x),\nwhere yt is the t-th token and y<t is its prefix.\n8https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/anthropic#usage\u2014\nthinking\u2013reasoning_content\n9https://community.openai.com/t/o3-mini-unsupported-\nparameter-temperature/1140846/3\n10https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-\nclaude/extended-thinking#feature-compatibility\n18\n\nModel\nInput Price ($ per 1M tokens)\nOutput Price ($ per 1M tokens)\nOpenAI models\nGPT-4.1-2025-04-14\n2.00\n8.00\no3-mini-2025-01-31\n1.10\n4.40\no3-2025-04-16\n2.00\n8.00\no4-mini-2025-04-16\n1.10\n4.40\nGPT-5-2025-08-07\n1.25\n10.00\nGPT-oss-120B (Together AI)\n0.15\n0.60\nDeepSeek models\nDeepSeek-V3-0324\n0.14\n0.28\nDeepSeek-R1-0120\n0.55\n2.19\nDeepSeek-R1-0528\n0.55\n2.19\nAlibaba Qwen models (Together AI)\nQwen3-32B\n0.40\n1.20\nGoogle models\nGemini-2.5-Pro-Preview-05-06\n1.25\n10.00\nMeta models (Together AI)\nLlama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8\n0.27\n0.85\nAnthropic models\nClaude-Sonnet-4-20250514\n3.00\n15.00\nTable 8: Pricing ($ per 1M tokens) for input and output across different LLM providers at the time of writing,\nwithout any discounts.\nD.2\nExtended Setup\nD.2.1\nTraining Settings\nWe filter out instances with a token length greater\nthan 4096.11 The models are trained for 5 epochs\nwith a cosine learning rate scheduler, a maximum\nlearning rate of 1e-5, and 3% warmup steps.\nD.2.2\nEvaluation setup\nThe reasoning models could produce excessively\nlong outputs, and may be prone to self-repetition\nwith greedy decoding (DeepSeek-AI, 2025). In this\nwork, unless otherwise specified, we apply greedy\ndecoding on non-CoT fine-tuned models and top-\np=0.95, temperature=0.6 on reasoning models,\nwith a maximum generation length of 64K. From\nour preliminary studies, we observe that the setup\ngenerally reflects the best performance for both set-\ntings, and the decoding setup matches the recom-\nmended setup from recent efforts in large reasoning\nmodels, such as Llama-Nemotron (Bercovich et al.,\n2025a). Notably, for Qwen (Yang et al., 2024)\nmodels and their variants, we apply YaRN context\nextension (Peng et al., 2023) as recommended by\nthe official model card (Team, 2024).\nD.3\nExtended Baseline Results\nRecent efforts that leverage SYNTHETIC-1 or simi-\nlar data with reasoning traces for training reasoning\n11Longer input lengths would slow down our training in\nquadratic order based on 8 80GB A100/H100 GPUs.\nLLMs often incorporate data spanning from math\nto coding (Mattern et al., 2025) without focusing\non science-related tasks, providing hard-to-analyze\nsynergy and suboptimal performance in scientific\nreasoning (see SYNTHETIC-1-SFT in Table 10).\nAs shown in Table 1, Qwen-STEM and Qwen-\nMath both exhibit significant improvement over\nthe base model on SCIREAS and SCIREAS-PRO.\nQwen-Math slightly outperforms Qwen-STEM on\nSCIREAS and the gap is amplified on SCIREAS-\nPRO.\nGiven limited subject coverage on SYNTHETIC-\n1-Math dataset, the strong performance of check-\npoints fine-tuned on it only seems surprising \u2014\nDoes the improvement come from generalization\nfrom math reasoning to a wider domain, or is it be-\ncause the high-reasoning instances in our datasets\nare math-intensive? To answer this question, we\ncategorize SCIREAS-PRO into math and non-math\ninstances by heuristics. Specifically, we label in-\nstances as math-needed if they contain explicit nu-\nmeric quantities that typically imply computation.\nImportantly, numbers that appear solely within\nunit expressions (e.g., \u201ccm2\u201d) or chemical formu-\nlas (e.g., \u201cH2O\u201d or \u201cNaCl\u201d) are not treated as in-\ndicators of math-related reasoning. Full details\nare provided in Appendix D.3.1. As shown in Ta-\nble 9, we find that math computation appears fre-\nquently among reasoning-intensive instances, and\nthe improvements on SCIREAS-PRO mostly come\n19\n\nfrom improved math capabilities. For non-math\ninstances, -math variants hardly improve, while -\nSTEM variants and -BOTH variants, trained with\nSTEM subjects data, show noticeable improve-\nments.\nModel\nMath Acc.\nNon-Math Acc.\nSCIREAS-PRO: 1,260 Instances\n#\n1,172\n88\nQwen\n14.25\n12.50\nQwen-STEM\n15.53\n23.86\nQwen-Math\n17.58\n13.64\nQwen-BOTH\n20.56\n28.41\nLlama\n11.52\n13.64\nLlama-STEM\n14.16\n15.91\nLlama-Math\n17.24\n13.64\nLlama-BOTH\n15.96\n23.86\nTable 9: Accuracy breakdown on math and non-math\ninstances for SCIREAS-PRO. -Math and -STEM vari-\nants contribute to different dimensions of performance,\nwhile -BOTH capture improvements on both dimen-\nsions.\nD.3.1\nMath vs. Non-Math\nA question is marked math-containing when it in-\ncludes\n1. a signed or unsigned integer/decimal (e.g. 3,\n-2.5, 60, 9.81),\n2. not embedded inside a word (so digits in H2O,\nCOVID-19, IL-2 . . . are ignored), and\n3. optionally followed\u2014without intervening let-\nters\u2014by any one of the unit strings listed in\nFig. 10.\nUnits recognised by the heuristic\n\u2022 %\n\u00b0C, \u00b0F, K,\n\u00b0\n\u2022 g,\nkg,\nmg,\n\u00b5g/ug,\nlb/lbs,\noz\n\u2022 m, cm, mm, km\nL/l,\nmL/ml,\n\u00b5L/\u00b5l/ul\n\u2022 Pa, kPa, MPa,\natm, bar, mbar\n\u2022 J, kJ, MJ; W,\nkW, MW, GW\n\u2022 V, kV; A, mA,\n\u00b5A/uA\n\u2022 Hz, kHz, MHz,\nGHz\n\u2022 cm2, m2, mm2,\nkm2\ncm3, m3, mm3,\nkm3\n\u2022 mol;\nM, mM,\n\u00b5M/uM,\nnM,\npM\n\u2022 dB; rpm; rad/s\n\u2022 s, ms, \u00b5s/us, ns;\nmin, h\nday/days;\nyr/yrs\nFigure 10: Unit suffixes accepted by the numeric heuris-\ntic.

Read the entire reasoning chain.\n2. Identify each discrete fact or insight expressed.\n3. Rewrite each as a self-contained, generalizable\nsentence.\n4.

R-loops are structures formed when a strand of\nRNA hybridizes with its complementary DNA\nstrand, displacing the other DNA strand.\n2. Morpholino can prevent spliceosome binding.\n3. Preventing spliceosome binding can lead to exon\nskipping.\n4. Exon skipping can result in in-frame joining of\nexons.\n5. The process of using Morpholino to induce exon\nskipping does not involve R-loops.\nFigure 12: Example KIs extracted from Qwen2.5-7B-\nInstruct.\nKNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION OUT-\nPUT\nBased on the reasoning chain, here are all distinct\nknowledge pieces:\n1. Morpholino oligonucleotides can bind to the 5\u2019\nsplice site of pre-mRNA to block spliceosome\nrecognition.\n2. Blocking spliceosome binding prevents normal\nintron removal and leads to exon skipping.\n3. Exon skipping can enable in-frame joining of ad-\njacent exons, preserving the reading frame.\n4. Antisense molecules function by complementary\nbase-pairing to specific RNA sequences to modu-\nlate splicing.\n5. Lariat structures are formed during canonical splic-\ning via branch site interactions but are absent when\nspliceosome activity is inhibited.\n6. R-loops are DNA-RNA hybrid structures unrelated\nto spliceosome-mediated exon skipping mecha-\nnisms.\n7. The polyA tail is added post-transcriptionally and\nis not directly involved in splice site selection or\nexon skipping processes.\nFigure 13: Example KIs extracted from Qwen-Math.\nKNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION OUT-\nPUT\nBased on the reasoning chain, here are all distinct\nknowledge pieces:\n1. Morpholinos are antisense oligonucleotides that\nbind to complementary RNA sequences.\n2. The spliceosome recognizes splice sites on pre-\nmRNA through components like U1 snRNP, which\nbinds to the 5\u2019 splice site.\n3. Blocking spliceosome access to a splice site pre-\nvents recognition of exon boundaries and causes\nexon skipping.\n4. Exon skipping can restore the reading frame by\njoining exons flanking the skipped exon.\n5. Functional proteins may be produced if skipped\nexons encode non-critical regions and the remain-\ning exons maintain an in-frame sequence.\n6. Lariat structures form during canonical splicing\nwhen introns are removed via branch site cleavage.\n7. R-loops are nucleic acid structures involving RNA-\nDNA hybrids and are not directly involved in\nspliceosome-mediated splicing.\n8. Antisense oligonucleotide therapies rely on\nsequence-specific binding to pre-mRNA targets.\n9. Polyadenylation (polyA tail addition) occurs dur-\ning mRNA maturation and is unrelated to splice\nsite selection or exon skipping mechanisms.\nFigure 14: Example KIs extracted from DeepSeek-R1.\nE.2\nKnowledge Probing\nWe provide our probing question synthesis prompt\n(Figure 15), example input and output (Figure 16),\nand knowledge probing results in Table 4.\n22\n\nUSER MESSAGE\nYou are a meticulous question-authoring assistant.\nYour job is to convert declarative knowledge state-\nments into *probing* multiple-choice questions that\ncan test whether another language model truly stores\nthe fact in its parametric memory.\n## IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR QUES-\nTIONS:\n1.

Our approach defines three compositional axes: Theme (e.g., effi-\nciency, adaptivity), Domain (e.g., question answering, machine translation),\nand Method (e.g., adversarial training, linear attention). These elements\nrepresent high-level abstractions common in scientific work\u2014motivations,\nproblem settings, and technical approaches\u2014and serve as building blocks\nfor LLM-driven exploration. We mine elements from human experts or\nconference papers and show that prompting LLMs with curated combi-\nnations produces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded\nin current literature. This modern thinking machine offers a lightweight,\ninterpretable tool for augmenting scientific creativity and suggests a path\ntoward collaborative ideation between humans and AI.\n1\nIntroduction\nThere is a growing interest in the machine learning community in leveraging large language\nmodels (LLMs) to accelerate scientific discovery (Si et al., 2024; AI4Science & Quantum,\n2023; Collins et al., 2024; Singh et al., 2025; Jansen et al., 2025; Si et al., 2025). Among these\nprominent directions, one challenging topic is to use LLMs to conduct or assist the ideation\nprocess. Despite recent success in ideation with state-of-the-art language models (Si et al.,\n2024), community simulation (Yu et al., 2024), and reinforcement learning (Li et al., 2024),\nmodel-generated ideas can lack diversity (Si et al., 2024). In response, in this paper, we ask:\nDoes conditioning on explicit concept combinations help build a minimalist pipeline for diverse and\ngrounded research ideas?\nAn ideal pipeline shall be simple, scalable, and it can generate a diverse set of ideas. In\nthis work, we propose to create such a pipeline through revisiting one of the first human\nexplorations of artificial intelligence invented at the end of the thirteenth century, which\naims at creating new knowledge from logical combinations of concepts (Borges, 1937).\nLlull\u2019s machine includes multiple rotary disks of concepts, e.g., goodness, power, glory,\netc, where Llull believed studying all combinations of the elementary concepts would help\nunderstand a field of knowledge that can be covered by them. In light of the thinking, we\nrevisit the idea of element combination to create a modern version for LLM ideation.\nSpecifically, we design three disks of elements theme, domain, and method. Corresponding\nresearch ideas are then synthesized with a finite set of rules combining all elements1. For\nexample, with less is more as a theme, confidence calibration as a domain, Mamba (Gu & Dao,\n2024) as a method, and a simplest A+B+C template, after rewriting the raw idea with Claude\n3.7 (Anthropic, 2024), a candidate idea can be: Less Parameters, Better Calibration: Confidence-\nAware Training for Mamba Architectures. We conduct a pilot study validating the pipeline with\n\u2217\n\u2020 denotes equal contribution in alphabetic order. Corresponding contact email addresses:\n{xinranz3,sherryw}@andrew.cmu.edu.\n1Such a categorization is not exhaustive. We discuss this in the limitations section in the appendix.\n1\narXiv:2508.19200v1  [cs.AI]  26 Aug 2025\n\nPublished as a workshop paper at COLM 2025\nhuman-written elements and then scale the ideation with elements mined automatically\nfrom top-tier conferences, e.g., ICLR, ACL, etc.\nTo study the characteristics of the ideas, we first compare the statistics and elements (themes,\ndomains, and methods) extracted from different conferences across years, which sheds\nlight on the taste and preferences of different machine learning communities, e.g., from the\nsame number of papers, our pipeline extracts similar numbers of domain elements from\nACL and more method elements from ICLR. Next, with the raw ideas combined through\nautomatically extracted templates in the same pipeline, we further use LLMs to rewrite\nthem into research ideas. We compare these output ideas from Ram\u00b4on Llull\u2019s Thinking\nMachine with idea titles from previous work (Si et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2024), which suggests\ngood diversity and coverage of the ideas generated from our minimalist method2.\nIn this paper, we explore the potential of LLM ideation through reconstructing the thirteenth-\ncentury Ram\u00b4on Llull\u2019s thinking machine with modern data mining and automatic evaluation\ntechniques. We anticipate the proposed pipeline and resources to serve as (1) a simple but\nstrong baseline for LLM ideation; (2) an interesting view that motivates human researchers\nto find or review their ideas. The authors acknowledge the core contribution of our work\nas an investigation into quantifying how much research ideation can be mechanically\nautomated. We will open-source our code, data, and generated research ideas at https:\n//github.com/colinzhaoust/ramon llull public.\n2\nRelated Work\nSymbolic Reasoning\nRam\u00b4on Llull\u2019s thinking machine (Borges, 1937) is one of the earliest\nattempts at formalizing reasoning, laying the foundation for symbolic AI. It motivates\nlater developments such as mathematized logic (Uckelman, 2010), the universal Turing\nmachine (Turing, 1936), ontologies (Goerss, 2024) and knowledge graphs (Ji et al., 2021).\nWhile it shares with knowledge graphs the goal of representing structured information, the\nkey difference lies in their operational principles. Knowledge graphs capture large-scale\nrelational structures among extracted entities. In contrast, Llull\u2019s thinking machine starts\nwith a small and fixed set of core concepts and systematically explores their combinatorial\npossibilities using a rotating mechanism. This generative, combinatorial focus distinguishes\nit from the more static and structural nature of knowledge graphs.\nAutomatic Ideation\nRecent advancements have explored the use of LLMs to automate\nand enhance scientific and creative ideation. The most direct approach involves prompting\nLLMs to generate ideas in a single pass (Si et al., 2024). Building on this, other works incor-\nporate more structured techniques such as iterative boosting (Wang et al., 2024), knowledge\naugmentation (Baek et al., 2025), multi-agent collaboration (Yu et al., 2024), reinforcement\nlearning (Li et al., 2024), to refine ideation quality. A further step involves analogical rea-\nsoning (Hope et al., 2017), which mines high-quality ideas from structured knowledge by\ndrawing connections between similar concepts. Our approach moves one step beyond anal-\nogy: we identify high-quality core concepts and systematically explore their combinatorial\nspace\u2014inspired by Llull\u2019s thinking machine\u2014to generate novel and diverse ideas grounded\nin specific research communities. We further discuss related work on data mining from\nacademic papers in Appendix A.2.\n3\nThe Ram\u00b4on Llull\u2019s Thinking Machine\nFrom the historical context, Ram\u00b4on Llull designed the machine to provide answers to arbi-\ntrary questions with a combination of elements selected through spinning three concentric\nand revolving wood or metal disks3. Through patient manipulation of the multiplication\nand elimination, the machine will eventually produce a seemingly good answer.\n2The authors note that the diversity and coverage do not necessarily suggest the novelty and utility\nof the ideas, which require extensive human experimentation and evaluation to validate.\n3We present a figurative illustration in Appendix 3\n2\n\nPublished as a workshop paper at COLM 2025\nhierarchical\nadaptive\nrethink\nself-refine\nmemory\nmodular\ngrokking\nscaling\nmamba\nRL\ndiffusion\nKV\nSelf \nattention\nLinear\nmodels\noptimal \ntransport\nself \nsupervision\nagent\nplanning\nRAG\nsafety\ncalibration\nreasoning\npersuasion\ndebate\nTitle: Scaling Up Reinforcement Learning Agents\nvia Curriculum-Aligned Environment Synthesis\nRamon Llull's Thinking Machine\nscaling\nIdeation\nagent\nRL\nrethink\nplanning\nlinear models\nreasoning\nTitle:\nRethinking\nthe\nDivide:\nComparing\nPlanning and Reasoning with Linear Models\nAbstract: Scaling reinforcement learning (RL)\nagents\nto\nperform\nrobustly\nin\ncomplex\nenvironments remains a major challenge. \u2026..\ndemonstrating improved performance and sample\nefficiency over standard scaling methods.\nAbstract:\nPlanning\nand\nreasoning\nare\ncore\ncomponents of intelligent behavior, traditionally\nstudied in of linear models. \u2026\u2026 These findings\nprompt\na\nrethinking\nof\nmodel\ndesign\nfor\ninterpretable and efficient AI systems.\nElement Mining\nAbstract\nTitle\nA\nB\nC\nT\nFigure 1: The overall pipeline of using the concept of Ram\u00b4on Llull\u2019s thinking machine\nfor research ideation. It includes three main steps (1) element mining: mining and merge\nelements (like keywords representing themes, domains, and methods) from papers in top\nconferences; (2) combinational thinking: combining extracted elements through symbolic\nrecombination similar with Ram\u00b4on Llull\u2019s thinking machine; (3) idea generation: generating\nabstract-style research ideas based on templates and elements.\nWe consider this process a simulation of one kind of human ideation process: a researcher\nmay see a good paper and decide to apply it to their own domains, e.g., the recent success\nin introducing teacher forcing to diffusion (Chen et al., 2024)4. There is no guarantee on if\nthis ideation process is the best in terms of novelty, but it shall be considered as a common\npractice in various communities.\nIn a formal way, given three disks of elements A = {a1, a2, ...}, B = {b1, b2, ...}, C =\n{c1, c2, ...} and a template T 5, Ram\u00b4on Llull\u2019s Thinking Machine \u03d5 outputs the raw idea\nx = \u03d5(A, B, C, T), where T can require \u22651 elements from each disk. Then, given a large\nlanguage model m, following the setup of (Si et al., 2024), we denote the ideation as the\ngeneration of a title and a corresponding abstract, (t, abs) \u223cm(x). We show our pipeline\nof element mining and ideation in Figure 1, with details in the following sections. At this\nstage, we leave sampling execution plans from the raw idea to future work.\n3.1\nBuilding the Idea Generator\nElements.\nSimilar to the original thinking machine, we design three disks to capture the\nminimum description of the ideation context:\n\u2022 Theme (A): the theme of the work, which highlights a particular scene or purpose to\nconduct the study, e.g., less is more, few-shot, adaptive, aggregation, in-the-wild, is all you need,\netc. The theme elements might be revisited with different names in the literature, where\n\u201ctrendy\u201d themes can also be different across communities.\n\u2022 Domain (B): the domain of the work, which indicates a potential set of tasks to solve and\nprevious work to follow, e.g., argument mining, question answering, etc.\n\u2022 Method (C): the method of the work, which shows how certain problems are addressed\nwith specific adoption or adaptation of a model, data, or training framework, e.g., trans-\nformer, state-space models, preference optimization, etc.\n4We also note other processes, e.g., see an abnormal phenomenon (Goyal et al., 2025), answer a\nquestion of the community (Wu et al., 2024), and push to the extreme condition (Shao et al., 2024).\n5For example, a + b + c or compare c1 and c2 in b1 under a1\n3\n\n\n\nso\u2122\n\n23ICL\n\n\nPublished as a workshop paper at COLM 2025\nCommunity\nA (Theme)\nB (Domain)\nC (Method)\nNLP\nadaptive, less is more, hi-\nerarchical, in-the-wild, self-\nrefine,\nhindsight,\nrethink,\ngrokking, long-tail, composi-\ntional, multi-hop\nagent, planning, re-\ntrieval, safety, calibra-\ntion, reasoning, mem-\norization, persuasion,\ndebate\nMamba, RL, Linear\nModels, KV Cache,\nQuantization, Diffu-\nsion,\nSelf-attention,\nSelf-supervision\nCV\ntest-time\nTraining,\nmeta\nlearning,\nactive\nlearning,\nopen-set calibration, open-\nvocab grounding, continual\nlearning\nimage\nclassification,\ndetection, segmenta-\ntion, optical flow esti-\nmation, action recog-\nnition\nViT, NeRF, ConvNext,\npoint-transformer,\nPerceiver,\nInstant-\nNGP,\nYolo,\nUNet,\nLoRA\nRL Theory\nparametric policy optimiza-\ntion, online learning, offline\nlearning, adversarial, corrup-\ntion, linear policy, general\nfunction approximation\nmulti-armed / con-\ntextual\nbandits,\nMarkov\ndecision\nprocesses,\nMarkov\ngames,\nstochastic\nshortest path\n\u03b5-greedy, Thompson\nsampling, upper con-\nfidence bound, opti-\nmism, pessimism\nTable 1: Lists of Theme (A), Domain (B), and Method (C) written by researchers from different\ncommunities.

All denotes the cumulative elements after merging and\nfiltering. # X denotes the number of X.\nWe select the current disks to form the minimum description of a research idea: we did\na in b with c, as described in the IMRaD format of academic writing (Nair & Nair, 2014).\nHowever, elements in the disks can be non-exclusive, e.g., retrieval can be considered as\na domain with various tasks, as well as a set of methods for other domains. We discuss\nother potential axes of the machine in Section 4.4. We further discuss the relations of the\nintra/inter-disk elements in Appendix A.1.\nIdeation.\nWith the disks in hand, to capture the diverse relations and combinations among\nelements, we extend the original Ram\u00b4on Llull\u2019s Thinking Machine with templates for gen-\neration, which is widely used in the knowledge graph construction (Zhang et al., 2020).\nA template serves as a way to combine the elements, with potential additional descrip-\ntive words on their relations. Besides the aforementioned \u201cwe did a in b with c\u201d, other\nrudimentary templates can be \u201ccompare c1 and c2 in b1 under a1\u201d or \u201cc1 is all you need\u201d.\n3.2\nMining the elements and templates\nPilot: Human Annotation.\nTo validate our design of the disks, we first seek elements of the\ndisks from PhD students from different communities6. Table 1 presents the theme, domain,\nand method elements written by human experts. With LLM rewriting, these elements\ncan already lead to interesting research ideas, e.g., from hindsight, debate, RL, Claude 3.7\n6Each volunteer has published 5+ papers in the conferences of the corresponding community.\n4\n\nPublished as a workshop paper at COLM 2025\ncan output a title: Learning to Argue in Hindsight: Multi-Agent Debate with Retrospective\nReinforcement Learning with a reasonable abstract.\nAmong different communities, there are similarities, e.g., transformer and diffusion, and\ndifferences, e.g., multi-hop vs. inverse rendering. In recent years, certain ideas from one\ncommunity have motivated the novel directions in other communities, e.g., transformer for\nvision (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) and diffusion for text (Li et al., 2022), and vice versa, which\ninspires us to study and auto-extraction of these elements from conferences acknowledged\nin different communities.\nMining from the Literature.\nTo automate and scale the element harvest, we propose to\nautomatically mine the elements and templates from different top-tier conferences, which\nallows for extendability to our pipeline. Specifically, we use Gemini 2.0 Flash (Gemini Team\net al., 2024) to process each paper title and abstract into lists of A, B, C, and a template with a\ncarefully designed element extraction prompt. Upon acquiring the elements from different\npapers, since we observe duplications among the elements, we then leverage Gemini 2.0\nFlash again to merge the elements based on the semantic similarities. The detailed prompts\nare presented in Appendix A.6.\nWe collected the papers from Paper Copilot (Yang, 2025), with ICLR 24, COLM 24, COLT 24,\nACL 24, ACL 23, and ACL 22 as the selected conferences to cover a diverse set of topics. We\nrandomly sampled 2,000 papers for ICLR 24. Table 2 presents the statistics of the acquired\nelements. In total, we collect more than 600 elements for each category from the analysis\nof 7,483 papers. From the same pipeline, for ACL, the number of method elements that\ncan be extracted from Gemini decreases over the years, e.g., noise sensitivity, multi-criteria\noptimization, and early exit that appear in ACL 23 no longer appear in ACL 22. With a similar\nnumber of papers analyzed, with a similar number of domain elements, ICLR 24 also covers\nmore themes and method elements compared to ACL 2024. Example elements for other\nconferences are in the appendix (Table 6)\nWe note that these elements are merged from the raw elements processed from the papers,\nwhich can potentially lead to more elements at a finer granular view, e.g., the element gener-\nalization is merged from generalizability, domain generalizability, and temporal generalization,\nwhich can lead to subtle but crucial changes in the paper story and experiment design. We\nwill open-source the finer-granular elements as well as their visited counts.\n3.3\nDiscussion\nWith all the elements in hand, we can then generate the raw ideas by combining them with\nthe templates. We propose two uses for the resources: (1) randomly sample a template,\ne.g., Compare c1 and c2 in b1 under a1, and randomly fill in the elements; (2) enumerate the\ntop-visited elements and templates to construct a diverse set of raw ideas to fuel the studies\non downstream execution or quality evaluation. We further study the characteristics of the\ngenerated ideas before and after LLM rewriting in Section 4.\nIn our current design, we treat each equally in sampling after ranking with their visit\ncounts from the papers. We also note that the statistical features, such as the popularity of\nan element or selectional preference (Zhang et al., 2019) among elements, can potentially\nsuggest a better sampling process for the raw ideas or disk categorization. For example,\nwe can build a Viterbi-like sampling process considering the selectional preference as the\ntransitive scores. On the other hand, a fine-grained element sampling process can lead to a\ncontrollable ideation process, e.g., sampling the frequent elements can potentially increase\nthe relevance to specific conferences, while sampling randomly can potentially increase the\ndiversity of the ideas, which leads to a trade-off between the relevance and diversity.\nAt the current stage, we build the pipeline with pre-defined disk types and leave the\nextension of the data mining and ideation pipeline for future work.\n5\n\nPublished as a workshop paper at COLM 2025\nICLR2024\nCOLT2024\nCOLM2024\nACL2024\nACL2023\nACL2022\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\nDensity\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nDensity\n25\n50\n75\n100\n125\n150\n175\nDensity\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nDensity\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\nDensity\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\nDensity\nGenerated idea T-SNE distribution by Conference - Density Heatmaps\nFigure 2: The density heatmap visualization of ideas generated from the basic A, B, C\ntemplate with top-20 most visited elements from each disk for each conference.

To avoid the\nnoise from redundant words in the templates, we use the basic A, B, C template with the\ntop 20 most visited elements from each disk to generate the raw research ideas. For each\nconference, we will have 4,000 raw research ideas. Then we convert the research ideas to\nTF-IDF vectors and apply t-SNE for the visualization.\nAs presented in Figure 2, we can observe different relations among the conferences: (1)\nCOLT 2024 ideas (green dots) are comparatively standalone, with limited coverage with\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished as a workshop paper at COLM 2025\nIdeation Methods\n# Ideas\n# Words\nDiversity\nSimilarity\nRelevance\nSi et al.

ICLR 2024 ideas (blue dots) have an overlap with ACL 2024 ideas, but still\nhave a standalone area of clusters; (2) COLM 2024 ideas (red cross) lie in the intersection of\nACL 2024, ICLR 2024, and COLT 2024, which shows the joint interests of language modeling\nfrom different communities, as the full name of COLM is Conference on language modeling;\n(3) As a sanity check, ACL 2024 and ACL 2023 ideas are largely overlapping, although\nshifts in interests still can lead to standalone clusters. We present an extended study on the\ndifferences of elements of ACL over the years in Appendix A.4.\nWe further qualitatively compare the elements for ACL 2024 and ICLR 2024 in Table 3,\nwhich indicates the causes of the geometrical relations in the t-SNE visualizations: how\nresearchers submit to different conferences show shared (e.g., LLMs and Transformers) and\ndivergent interests (natural language inference vs. federated learning).\n4.2\nComparing different ideation methods\nWith the elements in hand, we can then generate the research ideas with LLMs rewriting.\nSpecifically, we use Gemini-1.5 Pro to rewrite the sampled combination, for example, with\nelement emergent, theory of mind, and variational inference, the rewritten generated idea is:\nEmergent Theory of Mind in Disentangled Latent Spaces via Variational Inference. We consider\ntwo variants of our thinking machine based on the sampling methods: (1) Ram\u00b4on Llull (Top):\nwe select the most visited elements from the disks and enumerate all the combinations; (2)\nRam\u00b4on Llull (Random): we randomly sample elements from all disks and ensure that each\nelement only appear once at most.\nWe compare these rewritten ideas from previous work on ideation: (1) Si et al. (2024)\ncarefully sample and filter AI-generated ideas and list 93 high-quality ideas on 7 NLP topics,\nincluding Bias, Coding, Safety, Multilingual, Factuality, Math, and Uncertainty. These ideas\nare then used for novelty evaluation (Si et al., 2024) and execution study (Si et al., 2025);\n(2) Yu et al. (2024) simulate the diverse discussion in the research community and generate\nideas in a question-and-answer format. To allow fair comparison. We select 100 ideas from\nYu et al. (2024) from the batch where discussions are based on certain previous papers. To\nallow fair comparison, we select 100 ideas from each of our thinking machine variants with\nelements extracted from ACL 20247. We only compare the sampled research idea titles for\nall the methods.\nWe consider various metrics to compare the ideation methods, including diversity, similarity,\nand relevance to certain conference papers.\nFor diversity, we follow (Li et al., 2015) to use distinct-1 as a metric, the number of distinct\nunigram count normalized by the total number of words to capture the diversity of concise\ntitles. For future work involving abstract or sections, the metric of diversity can be extended\nto entropy-based metrics as described in Zhang et al. (2025).\nFor relevance and similarity, we consider using paper titles from the main track accepted\npapers from ACL 2025 to ground the comparison, where the accepted papers are released\n7The authors note that the comparative study is mainly set up to compare the characteristics of\nthese ideation methods. Since the previous methods are designed to sample ideas for their own\npurposes: novelty evaluation (Si et al., 2024) and research community simulation (Yu et al., 2024). The\nresults from our metrics do not suggest the superior quality of any method. Rigorous idea quality\nevaluation may involve extensive expert annotation and insights from execution (Si et al., 2025).\n7\n\nPublished as a workshop paper at COLM 2025\nMetric\nACL 2024\nACL 2023\nACL 2022\nICLR 2024\nCOLM 2024\nCOLT 2024\nOverall\nDecomp. %\n99.5%\n99.2%\n99.2%\n99.6%\n100.0%\n100.0%\n99.5%\nRecon. %\n17.6%\n17.8%\n19.9%\n15.6%\n11.0%\n8.2%\n16.4%\nTable 5: Bijective coverage results across conferences.\nafter June 2025. To reduce the chance of LLMs seeing the paper titles in their training\ndata (Gemini 1.5 Pro was released Feb 2024). Specifically, for relevance, we compute the\naverage BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) between each generated idea and each conference\npaper title pair to measure how likely a generated title is relevant to the conference. For\nsimilarity, we measure how likely a research paper title in ACL 2025 is similar to a generated\nidea. Similar to our experiments in Appendix A.4, we use token-level Jaccard similarity to\ncapture the similarity of a pair of titles. We report the similarity as the average across ACL\n2025 paper titles that scored the top-K highest similarities, where K equals the number of\nmodel-generated ideas.\nTable 4 presents the different characteristics of different automated ideation methods: Ram\u00b4on\nLlull (Top) that enumerates combinations of the most trending elements achieved the highest\nsimilarity and Ram\u00b4on Llull (Random) that samples random elements achieve the highest\ndiversity, with a decrease in relevance - which demonstrates a trade-off between diversity\nand similarity/relevance. Our Ram\u00b4on Llull thinking machines also show lower relevance\ncompared to human filter ideas (Si et al., 2024) or ideas from simulated discussions grounded\non certain papers (Yu et al., 2024). One potential reason can be that although the random\nsampling of elements leads to a diverse set of ideas, they are not necessarily the direction of\nresearch acknowledged by the community. Future fine-grained sampling identifying the\nrelations among the elements can be a future direction to improve the ideation process of\nour Ram\u00b4on Llull thinking machine.\n4.3\nAnalysis: How much of research ideation is combinatorial?\nIn this section, we test to what degree the ideation of machine learning research can be\nexplained by our proposed Ram\u00b4on Llull system. To this end, we conduct a coverage analysis.\nThis evaluation tests two complementary aspects:\n\u2022 Decomposition: Given a research paper title, can it be decomposed into constituent A,\nB, C elements from our extracted disks? We consider a research idea decomposable if\nGemini 2.0 Flash successfully converts the paper title into theme, domain and method\nelements that our method already extracted.\n\u2022 Reconstruction: Given the theme, domain and method elements alone, can they be\ncombined to approximately reconstruct the title of the original paper? We consider the\nresearch idea reconstructible if Gemini 2.0 can propose a title that is highly similar (\u2265\n30% Jaccard similarity) given the extracted keywords.8\nTable 5 presents our bijective coverage results across 7,483 papers from six major confer-\nences. We find near-universal decomposability (99.5%): almost all research papers can be\ndecomposed into our A+B+C framework. This validates that the three-disk design captures\nfundamental aspects of research ideation across machine learning communities.\nOn the other hand, reconstructibility is limited (16.4%). That said, a non-trivial fraction of\nreal paper ideas can already be faithfully reconstructed by combining ideas in our proposed\nRam\u00b4on Llull framework. While the framework successfully captures structural building\nblocks that are nearly universal across machine learning research, we note that the specific\ninstantiation of a research idea may still require creativity and insights that go beyond\nmere combination of past ideas, and researchers\u2019 prior and taste may remain essential to\neffectively navigate this combinatorial space.\n8Additional evaluation details (e.g., prompts) are reported in A.8.\n8\n\nPublished as a workshop paper at COLM 2025\n4.4\nAnalysis: What is not covered by A+B+C?\nBeyond the disk view of automated ideation, we identify other dimensions of the problem\nas follows, to serve as potential motivations for the community:\n\u2022 Perturbation. Given the same set of A, B, C, the final paper can be drastically different.\nAkin to the trivial and non-trivial perturbation (x2 \u2192x4vs.x2 \u2192x\u22121) discussed in Huang\net al. (2025), certain perturbations can potentially change the problem fundamentally.\nStudying pairs of ideas that have identical elements discovered in our pipeline can\npotentially allow a fine-grained study on the sparks of non-trivial perturbations that\nlargely reshape the problem.\n\u2022 The 4th Axis. In Section 3, we build our ideation pipeline with Theme (A), Domain\n(B), and Method (C) as the disks. Another axis of the machine can be \u201calgorithms\u201d vs\n\u201canalysis\u201d. Axis C currently says that the research idea should use the specified method,\nbut a method can be both used and studied/analyzed. With this fourth disk, the machine\ncan cover further analysis-based work, such as adversarial examples (Szegedy et al.,\n2013) and edge-of-stability (Cohen et al., 2021). Such analysis work often leads to the\ndiscovery of new/revived phenomena, such as Agreement-on-the-line (Baek et al., 2022),\nGrokking (Power et al., 2022), and Model Collapse (Shumailov et al., 2024).\n\u2022 Negation. Another dimension of non-A+B+C ideas is the negation of commonly believed\nA+B+C, which often leads to wide community discussion, rethinking of the directions,\nand improved evaluation, such as the mirage of a phenomenon (Schaeffer et al., 2023),\nthe gap between automatic and human evaluation (Durmus et al., 2022; Gehrmann et al.,\n2022), and the misuse of certain tools (Grusky, 2023)\n5\nDiscussion and Future Work\nIn this paper, we propose to create a modern Ram\u00b4on Llull thinking machine for automated\nideation, which serves as a lightweight and interpretable tool to create a diverse set of\nLLM-generated ideas, as well as a perspective to study the commonality and differences in\nthe human ideation process across different communities. We discuss the intended usage\nand future work as follows:\nIntended Usage.\nThe proposed Ram\u00b4on Llull thinking machine is NOT intended to (1)\nconduct DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service) on the current brittle reviewing system (Kim\net al., 2025); (2) evaluate or attack certain human-generated ideas. Our Ram\u00b4on Llull\u2019s\nThinking Machine is intended to serve as (1) a baseline for future study on ideation with\na filtered set of components, i.e., theme, topics, and domains; (2) motivation for human\nresearchers to track the field status quo and their own ideas. We plan to open-source 1,000\nhigh-quality human-filtered ideas to conduct a stealth human study on the execution of the\nideas in a human-AI collaborative manner with real research labs.\nFuture Work.\nWe expect to extend our pipeline through (1) evaluating the quality of the\ngenerated ideas; (2) studying the human ideation and polishing process through the lens\nof Ram\u00b4on Llull\u2019s Thinking Machine; (3) studying how the execution process can serve as\nelements or factors of sampling.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors thank Hongming Zhang, Sihao Chen, Zhiyuan Zeng, Wenhao Yang, Fengyu\nCai, and Ben Zhou, as well as other fellow AI2 interns (including but not limited to Hita,\nYapei, Fede, Anej, Amanda, Michael, Nishant, Peiling, Alexiss, and etc) and UW students,\nfor their insights into design and evaluation choices.

While these metrics are useful for\nassessing the breadth and community-alignment of the generated idea space, they could\nbe insufficient for judging the scientific merit of individual idea under some circumstances.\nFor instance, a generated idea that is lexically unique in terms of diversity, but could be\nconceptually trivial or scientifically unsound. An idea might achieve high relevance by\nclosely mirroring existing research trends, making it plausible but potentially incremental\nand not truly novel. Conversely, a truly groundbreaking idea might score low on relevance\nbecause it deviates significantly from established paradigms. A more rigorous assessment\nrequires moving beyond surface-level statistics to semantic evaluation, for which human\nexpert judgment remains the gold standard. Experts assess ideas along critical aspects\nlike feasibility, potential impact, and non-obviousness, providing qualitative depth that\ntext-based metrics are not designed to capture. However, large-scale human evaluation is\ndifficult to scale, expensive, and subject to inter-annotator variability. Securing a diverse\npool of experts capable of judging ideas across the wide range of generated topics is a\nmajor logistical challenge. LLM-as-a-judge frameworks, such as the one proposed by (Li\net al., 2023) trained with carefully designed rubrics, might be biased by its training data,\npotentially favoring well-phrased but shallow ideas over more bad-worded but conceptually\ndeep ones. A future direction is a hybrid evaluation pipeline that leverages our quantitative\nmetrics for initial filtering, employs LLM-as-a-judge for scalable scoring, and incorporates\ntargeted human experts for final validation.\nOrganizing the elements.\nWhile our current implementation, which treats conceptual\nelements as independent items, has successfully generated a wide breadth of ideas, it can\nbe further enriched by the structured relationships that exist between scientific concepts.\nOne extension is to evolve from simple, flat lists to categorical and hierarchical structures by\nlinking to the keywords in OpenReview or the task and method hierarchies on Papers with\nCode9. This would enable more granular control over ideation \u2014 for example, allowing\nsampling at different level of abstraction. Another possible direction is to explicitly model\nthe exclusiveness of selection preferences to learn which combinations of themes, domains,\nand methods are most likely to be coherent. By integrating such structured knowledge, our\nsystem would transform into a more semantic-aware ideation that is capable of generating\nideas that are both novel and conceptually sound.\nA.2\nExtended Discussion\nRelated Work: Data Mining from Literature\nExtracting structured information from\nacademic papers is a critical research area (Zhang et al., 2024). Prior work has explored\nconcept-level understanding through methods such as topic discovery (Lee et al., 2022)\nand concept matching (Kang et al., 2024), often operating over large sets of concepts using\nclustering or taxonomy construction. Ontology-based approaches (M\u00a8uller et al., 2004)\nsimilarly aim to organize and retrieve scientific knowledge from literature at the conceptual\nlevel. In contrast, our work focuses on identifying a small set of high-quality concepts,\nspecifically, the theme, domain, and method of each article, that are used as rotating wheels\nin Llull\u2019s thinking machines. This design supports combinatorial exploration and enables\nideation within and across research communities.\nHow to view A+B+C?\nThe same A+B+C can lead to different results and execution. For\nthe utility and feasibility of the idea execution, it is vital to analyze why the components are\ncomplementary: e.g., why a core problem in a domain requires an architectural change or\ncan be viewed as a specific theme.\n9paperswithcode.com\n14\n\nPublished as a workshop paper at COLM 2025\nCommunity\nA (Theme)\nB (Domain)\nC (Method)\nICLR 24\nrepresentation learning, of-\nfline learning, sparsity, inter-\npretability, explainable, un-\nsupervised learning, uncer-\ntainty, multi-modal, multi-\nhop, reference free, fairness,\ncontrastive learning,\nsam-\npling, heterogeneity, out-of-\ndistribution, active learning,\nhierarchical structure, meta-\nlearning\nplanning, safety, re-\ninforcement learning,\nquestion answering,\ncalibration,\nauto-\nmated\nresearch,\nfederated\nlearning,\nclassification, image\ngeneration, optimiza-\ntion,\nmemorization,\nrepresentation learn-\ning, segmentation\nOrdinary Differential\nEquations, visualiza-\ntion\ntool,\ndynamic\nprogramming, match-\ning function, plug-in\nmodules,\nsemi-\nsupervised learning,\nself-training, Text-to-\nImage\nGenerators,\nLinear Discriminant\nAnalysis\nCOLM 24\nin-context learning, in-the-\nwild, compositionality, self-\nevolve, long-tail, multi-hop,\nreference free, multi-modal,\ngeneralization,\nalignment,\nadaptation,\nrobustness,\ngranularity,\nmultilingual,\ninterpretability\ninference, RAG, au-\ntomated translation,\ndecision-making,\ndrug discovery, text\ngeneration,\nfine-\ntuning,\nargument\nmining, code editing,\npreference learning\nTransformers,\nSelf-\nattention,\nMamba,\nRWKV, SSMs, state\nspace models, RLHF,\nPPO,\nMixture-of-\nExperts,\nLoRA,\nRNNs, VQAs, Prun-\ning, deep generative\nmodels\nACL 24\nself-evolve,\ngeneralization,\ndomain generalization, tem-\nporal generalization, robust-\nness,\nresilient,\nparameter-\nefficient, multilingual, cross-\nlingual, multi-task learning,\ncross-task, bias, debiasing,\nmodularity,\nless is more,\nadaptive, adaptability, unsu-\npervised adaptation\nhuman-bot\ninterac-\ntion, entity ground-\ning, finance, equity\nresearch,\nmacroeco-\nnomics, tool learning,\nmetaphor interpreta-\ntion, game playing,\nopen-world\ngames,\nstyle transfer, medical\ndiagnostics\nRoBERTa,\nBART,\nByT5, diffusion mod-\nels, Latent Diffusion\nModel,\nBrownian\nBridge process, PLMs,\nSpiking Neural Net-\nwork,\ngenerative\nmodels,\ncontrastive\ndecoding\nTable 6: Lists of Theme (A), Domain (B), and Method (C) written by researchers from different\ncommunities.

We further compare the elements of different disks\nthrough the lens of token-level Jaccard similarity for ACL from 2022 to 2024. Table 7 shows\na higher similarity in the elements from domains compared to themes or methods. One\npotential reason is that ACL typically lists several tracks to guide the paper submission,\ne.g., Question Answering and NLP applications. The Jaccard similarity does not change a lot\nacross years, but the similarity is not high in general, which indicates the topical diversity\nin top-tier conferences. Besides the disappearance of method elements through the years,\n15\n\nPublished as a workshop paper at COLM 2025\nwe can also observe the occurring interests in certain elements. For the elements that appear\nuniquely in ACL 2024, disk A (theme) has perspective awareness, Multi-generator, etc; disk B\nhas Hateful Meme Detection, emotional support, etc.\nA.5\nExample ideas from different ideation methods\nThis section provides examples from three distinct AI-driven ideation methodologies, each\nproducing a different kind of conceptual output.

This perpetuates harmful societal\nprejudices and limits the models\u2019 ability to provide fair and inclusive responses across diverse user\ngroups.\n2. Motivation: Current approaches to reducing bias in language models typically focus on avoiding\nor counterbalancing stereotypes...

However, the existing information retrieval techniques\ncould be costly and may even introduce noisy and sometimes misleading knowledge. To address\nthese challenges, we propose the instance-level adaptive propulsion of external knowledge (IA-\nPEK), where we only conduct the retrieval when necessary. To achieve this goal, we propose to\nmodel whether a PTLM contains enough knowledge to solve an instance with a novel metric,\nThrust, which leverages the representation distribution of a small amount of seen instances. Ex-\ntensive experiments demonstrate that Thrust is a good measurement of models\u2019 instance-level\nknowledgeability. Moreover, we can achieve higher cost-efficiency with the Thrust score as the\nretrieval indicator than the naive usage of external knowledge on 88% of the evaluated tasks,\nwith 26% average performance improvement.

This paper investigates LVLMs\u2019\nperception of their knowledge boundaries\nby evaluating three types of confidence\nsignals:\nprobabilistic confidence,\nanswer\nconsistency-based confidence, and verbalized\nconfidence.\nExperiments on three LVLMs\nacross three VQA datasets show that, although\nLVLMs possess a reasonable perception level,\nthere is substantial room for improvement.\nAmong the three confidences, probabilistic and\nconsistency-based signals are more reliable\nindicators, while verbalized confidence often\nleads to overconfidence. To enhance LVLMs\u2019\nperception,\nwe adapt several established\nconfidence calibration methods from Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) and propose three\neffective methods. Additionally, we compare\nLVLMs with their LLM counterparts, finding\nthat jointly processing visual and textual inputs\ndecreases question-answering performance, but\nreduces confidence, resulting in an improved\nperception level compared to LLMs.\n1\nIntroduction\nLarge vision-language models (LVLMs) are capa-\nble of processing both textual and visual informa-\ntion simultaneously, demonstrating strong perfor-\nmance on visual question-answering (VQA) task\n(Bai et al., 2025a; Wu et al., 2024; OpenAI et al.,\n2024). However, when faced with questions be-\nyond their knowledge boundaries, LVLMs often\nhallucinate\u2014generating seemingly plausible but\nfactually incorrect responses (Liu et al., 2024a;\nBai et al., 2025b). This is unacceptable in safety-\ncritical domains such as healthcare. Knowing when\n\u2217Work done during an internship at ICT,CAS.\n\u2020Corresponding author\nan LVLM can answer correctly not only helps us\ndetermine when to trust the model but also enables\nadaptive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),\ntriggering RAG only when the model does not\nknow the answer, which improves both the effi-\nciency and effectiveness of RAG (Ni et al., 2024a).\nA trustworthy model should have a clear percep-\ntion of its knowledge boundaries\u2014knowing what it\nknows and what it does not. While this ability has\nbeen extensively studied in large language mod-\nels (LLMs) (Xiong et al., 2024; Tian et al., 2023;\nMoskvoretskii et al., 2025), it remains underex-\nplored in LVLMs. A model\u2019s perception level is as-\nsessed by the alignment between its confidence and\nactual performance, with correctness of the answer\nserving as a proxy for performance. Therefore, the\nemphasis is on whether LVLMs can provide con-\nfidence that matches their performance. We focus\non binary confidence because it directly helps us\ndecide whether to trust the model.\nIn this work, we explore this question by examin-\ning three representative types of confidence signals\nthat are widely used in LLMs: 1) Probabilistic\nconfidence (Desai and Durrett, 2020; Guo et al.,\n2017a). The confidence is measured by the genera-\ntion probability of tokens in the output. 2) Answer\nconsistency-based confidence (Zhang et al., 2024;\nManakul et al., 2023b). Some studies argue that\ntoken-level probabilities poorly reflect a model\u2019s\nsemantic confidence and are not suitable for black-\nbox models. Instead, they suggest using semantic\nconsistency across multiple responses as a confi-\ndence indicator. 3) Verbalized confidence (Lin\net al., 2022; Yang et al., 2024b). The natural lan-\nguage confidence expressed by the model, offering\nan intuitive and model-agnostic signal without re-\nquiring repeated sampling.\nWe conduct experiments using three represen-\ntative models\u2014-Qwen2.5-VL (Bai et al., 2025a),\nDeepSeek-VL2 (Wu et al., 2024), and LLaVA-v1.5\n(Liu et al., 2024b)\u2014on three datasets: Dyn-VQA\narXiv:2508.19111v1  [cs.CL]  26 Aug 2025\n\n(Li et al., 2025b), MMMU Pro (Yue et al., 2024),\nand Visual7W (Zhu et al., 2016). The results show\nthat LVLMs can perceive their knowledge bound-\naries to some extent, but there is still considerable\nroom for improvement. Among the three types of\nconfidence, probabilistic and answer consistency-\nbased confidences are more aligned with LVLMs\u2019\nperformance but rely on in-domain data for bina-\nrization, while verbalized confidence has weaker\nalignment and tends to be overconfident.\nTo enhance LVLMs\u2019 perception capabilities, we\nadopt several representative confidence calibration\nmethods originally designed for LLMs. The results\nshow that methods that engage the model\u2019s rea-\nsoning abilities can enhance both answer accuracy\nand verbalized perception level, whereas existing\nconsistency-based methods have limited effective-\nness and do not generalize well to LVLMs. We also\npropose three new approaches tailored for LVLMs:\nImg-CoT, Prob-Thr, and Cross Model, making fur-\nther explorations into measuring their confidence.\nCompared to LLMs, LVLMs need to process\nan additional visual modality and integrate infor-\nmation across different modalities.\nThis raises\nthe question: How does the perception ability of\nLVLMs differ from that of LLMs?\nTo investi-\ngate this, we compare the LVLMs with their cor-\nresponding LLMs on the Dyn-VQA dataset (Li\net al., 2025b; Tian et al., 2023).\nThis dataset\nprovides parallel visual-textual and pure textual\nqueries, ensuring fair comparison between LLMs\nand LVLMs. We focus on verbalized confidence\nbecause it can reflect the model\u2019s language capabil-\nities. Experimental results show that: 1) LVLMs\nexhibit lower VQA performance but higher per-\nception accuracy compared to their LLM counter-\nparts. 2) Certain prompting methods are ineffective\nfor LVLMs, showing that LVLMs have weaker\ninstruction-following capabilities.\nWe hypothesize these phenomena may be caused\nby the following two reasons: 1) Compared to pro-\ncessing single-modality information, handling vi-\nsual inputs and integrating multiple modalities is\nmore challenging for LVLMs. This results in lower\nVQA performance but also reduces the models\u2019\nconfidence, mitigating overconfidence and yield-\ning a more accurate perception of their abilities.\n2) Training LLMs without sufficient capacity to\naccommodate additional visual information can\nerode their language abilities, thereby weakening\ntheir instruction-following skills. Controlled ex-\nperiments across different model scales and input\nmodalities support these hypotheses.\n2\nRelated Work\nLLM Knowledge Boundary Perception. Prior re-\nsearch has primarily focused on knowledge bound-\nary perception in LLMs, with various methodolo-\ngies proposed to elicit confidence: verbalized con-\nfidence, where models directly articulate their con-\nfidence (Yang et al., 2024b; Yin et al., 2023; Zhang\net al., 2023); consistency based confidence that\nderive confidence from answer consistency across\nmultiple samples (Manakul et al., 2023a; Agrawal\net al., 2024); probabilistic confidence, leveraging\ngenerated token likelihoods (Guo et al., 2017b; Ma\net al., 2025; Ni et al., 2024b, 2025a); and internal\nstate probing confidence, examining hidden states\n(Azaria and Mitchell, 2023; Ni et al., 2025b). Dif-\nferently, our work investigates knowledge bound-\nary perception in LVLMs and provides the first\nsystematic comparison of these methods in the mul-\ntimodal setting.\nLVLMs. Previous studies have established the\nwidespread adoption of LVLMs in safety-critical\ndomains such as healthcare (Li et al., 2023; Hu\net al., 2024) and autonomous driving (Cui et al.,\n2024; Jiang et al., 2024). While these applications\ndemonstrate LVLMs\u2019 functional capabilities, stud-\nies show LVLMs frequently produce hallucinations\n(Bai et al., 2025b; Sahoo et al., 2024). The cur-\nrent body of work investigates this limitation on\ndifferent aspects. Some work surveys hallucination\ntypes and their causes (Liu et al., 2024a; Zhou et al.,\n2024; Lan et al., 2024), while others focus on miti-\ngating hallucinations (Li et al., 2025a; Wang et al.,\n2024a; Xiao et al., 2025). A distinct but less ex-\nplored research thread investigates LVLMs\u2019 knowl-\nedge boundary as a potential framework for en-\nhancing model reliability (Chen et al., 2025; Wang\net al., 2024b; Leng et al., 2024). We take this line of\nwork a step further by introducing a novel compar-\native paradigm that compares perception between\nLVLMs with their LLM counterparts.\n3\nPreliminaries\nIn this section, we provide an overview of our task.\n3.1\nTask Formulation\nVisual Question Answering. The goal of visual\nquestion answering (VQA) can be described as\n\nfollows. For a given question q and an image i, the\nmodel is asked to provide an answer a based on the\nquestion q and image i, that is, a = fmodel(q, i).\nLVLM Knowledge Boundary Perception. We as-\nsess the perception of LVLM\u2019s knowledge bound-\nary with the alignment between confidence and its\nactual performance. Here, we use the model\u2019s vi-\nsual question answering correctness to serve as a\nproxy for performance and elicit different kinds of\nmodel confidence estimates.\nConfidence Estimation. In this paper, we con-\nduct experiments on the following three kinds of\nmodel confidence estimates. As widely adopted\nand training-free, they can be elicited without\nchanging the internal knowledge of models.\nProbabilistic confidence is elicited through the\naggregation of token probabilities for scoring, fol-\nlowed by applying a threshold to binarize the score\ninto confidence. It is efficient but only captures\nlexical-level confidence and requires threshold tun-\ning on a held-out set, which leads to poor gener-\nalizability. Some studies also argue that it is not\napplicable to black-box models (Kuhn et al., 2023).\nAnswer consistency-based confidence is elicited\nby calculating the consistency of multiple gener-\nated responses. The core idea is that if the model\nknows the correct answer, multiple sampled an-\nswers should be semantically consistent. It better\ncaptures semantics than probabilistic confidence,\nbut is computationally expensive and still requires\nfitting a threshold (Manakul et al., 2023a).\nVerbalized confidence is elicited by directly ask-\ning the model to express confidence (Yang et al.,\n2024b). Compared to the other two confidences,\nthis confidence reflects models\u2019 self-awareness of\ntheir knowledge boundaries. Moreover, it elimi-\nnates the need for threshold fitting and multiple\nsampling. Therefore, this kind of confidence re-\nceives our primary focus.\n4\nKnowledge Boundary Perception in\nLVLMs\nThis section introduces experimental setup to eval-\nuate LVLMs\u2019 knowledge boundary perception abil-\nity. Along with the elicited confidence and confi-\ndence calibration methods evaluated by us.\n4.1\nExisting Methods\nHere, we systematically introduce three basic con-\nfidence estimates in Section 3, along with several\nconfidence calibration methods originally designed\nfor LLMs. We also propose new methods. Detailed\nprompts are in Appendix A.1. Basic confidence\nestimates are in underline, and others are existing\nconfidence calibration methods.\n4.1.1\nVanilla Confidence Estimation Methods\nProbabilistic confidence is elicited through token\nprobabilities. Here, we focus on the output perplex-\nity of models.\n\u2022 Perplexity Threshold (PPL-Thr):\nPerplexity\nquantifies a model\u2019s uncertainty in content gener-\nation (Cooper and Scholak, 2024). We binarize\nthis metric into confidence by applying a thresh-\nold decided on a held-out set.\nAnswer consistency-based confidence requires\nmodels to generate multiple responses, compute\ntheir consistency, and apply a threshold to the con-\nsistency scores for confidence elicitation. we im-\nplement a two-phase generation protocol: First,\ngenerating a reference answer with temperature =\n0; Then sampling 10 variant answers with tempera-\nture = 1.0, with semantic equivalence between the\nbasic answer and sampled answers evaluated by\nQwen2.5-0.5B.\n\u2022 Random Sample (Random): Simply sample re-\nsponses without modifying input.\nWe evaluate two types of verbalized confidence:\n(1) Single-step verbalized confidence, which is gen-\nerated simultaneously with the answer, and (2)\nDouble-step verbalized confidence, which is gener-\nated by asking the model for an answer in the initial\nround of dialogue, then providing its confidence in\nthe second round. The distinction between them\nlies in cognitive focus allocation: single-step confi-\ndence elicitation demands concurrent attention to\nboth answer and confidence generation, whereas\ndouble-step confidence elicitation enables sequen-\ntial processing.\n\u2022 Single-step Vanilla (Vanilla) : Simply ask the\nmodel to generate both the answer and confi-\ndence in a single interaction.\n\u2022 Double-step Self Judging (Self-Jud): First, ac-\nquiring the model to provide an answer to the\nquestion, then asking it to generate confidence.\n4.1.2\nCalibrating Verbalized Confidence\nThe three methods below aim to calibrate single-\nstep verbalized confidence:\n\u2022 Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Zero-shot Chain-of-\nThought prompting, Applying \u201cAnalyze step by\nstep\u201d to the query (Kojima et al., 2023).\n\n\u2022 Punish: Penalizing overconfidence via the in-\nstruction \u201cYou will be punished if the answer is\nnot right but you say certain\u201d.\n\u2022 Explain: Requesting models to provide answer\nexplanations before generating their confidence.\nThe three methods below aim to calibrate double-\nstep verbalized confidence:\n\u2022 Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Applying the Chain-\nof-Thought prompt in the confidence elicitation\nround of dialogue.\n\u2022 Challenge: We prepend the critical prompt \u201cI\ndon\u2019t think your answer is right\u201d to the query in\nthe confidence elicitation round in order to guide\nthe model to be less overconfident.\n\u2022 Punish: Applying the Punish prompt in the con-\nfidence elicitation round of dialogue.\n4.1.3\nCalibrating Answer Consistency-Based\nConfidence\n\u2022 Rephrasing (Rephr):\nTo address persistent\nerrors caused by a specific question phrase,\nrephrase the original question into semantically\nequivalent variants with different phrases (Yang\net al., 2024a).\n\u2022 Noised Image (Noised-Img): Reducing persis-\ntent errors caused by a specific image by creating\nsemantically equivalent variants through the ad-\ndition of subtle noise to the original image.\n\u2022 Rephrasing and Noised Image (Reph+Nois):\nA combination of the Rephrasing and the Noised\nImage methods.\n4.2\nNewly Proposed Methods\n\u2022 Image Chain of Thought (Img-CoT): Prompt-\ning models to generate textual image descrip-\ntions before reasoning to convert visual modality\ninformation to textual modality.\n\u2022 Probability Threshold (Prob-Thr): Prompting\nmodels to generate continuous probabilities of\nanswers (0\u20131), then applies a threshold to them\nto generate binary confidences. The threshold is\ndecided on a held-out set.\n\u2022 Cross Model: Utilizing generated responses\nfrom different models to calculate the consis-\ntency score. We generate answers using the three\nmodels mentioned in the next subsection. The\nprimary model generates four responses, while\nthe other two models each generate three re-\nsponses. We then calculate their consistency\nwith the answer obtained through greedy sam-\npling from the primary model to derive the con-\nfidence. This method can be viewed as using\nother models\u2019 answers to evaluate whether the\nanswer generated by a given model is reliable.\n4.3\nExperimental Setup\nDatasets. We conduct experiments on three VQA\nbenchmark datasets. They emphasize on LVLM\u2019s\ndifferent abilities. Visual7W (Zhu et al., 2016) em-\nphasizes abilities in vision comprehension, it con-\ntains 70K image-QA pairs for basic visual under-\nstanding. Dyn-VQA (Li et al., 2025b) emphasizes\nlanguage reasoning, it contains 1.5K questions test-\ning multi-modal knowledge and multi-hop reason-\ning.; MMMU Pro (Yue et al., 2024) emphasizes\nboth vision and language capability, it contains 12K\nexpert-curated multimodal questions. For evalua-\ntion, we respectively sample 550 questions from\nDyn-VQA and MMMU Pro datasets, and sample\n500 questions from the Visual7W dataset.\nModels.\nWe conduct experiments on three rep-\nresentative LVLMs: Qwen2.5-VL-7B (Bai et al.,\n2025a), DeepSeek-VL2-16B (Wu et al., 2024),\nand LLaVA-v1.5-7B (Liu et al., 2024b). We se-\nlected these three LVLMs because they are widely\nadopted and serve as established baselines in the\nfield. Additionally, since all three models are con-\nstructed by integrating visual encoders with their\ncorresponding LLMs, this choice enables a paral-\nlel comparison between the performance of these\nLVLMs and their respective LLMs in subsequent\nanalyses.\nFigure 1: Count of samples for various matches be-\ntween answer correctness and model confidence.

Please\nrefer to Appendix A.2 for implementation details\nand detailed results.\n4.4.1\nPerformance of Different Types of\nConfidence\nHere, we analyze three basic elicited confidence\u2019s\nperformance. Our findings are as follows:\n1) Compared to verbalized and probabilis-\ntic confidence, answer consistency-based confi-\ndence often shows higher alignment. As shown\nin Table 1, the basic answer-consistency based con-\nfidence (Random) achieves higher alignment com-\npared to verbalized (Vanilla, Self-Jud) and proba-\nbilistic confidences (PPL Thr) on both LLaVA-1.5\nand Deepseek-VL2. This may be because, unlike\nprobabilistic confidence that operates at the lexical\nlevel, answer consistency-based confidence better\ncaptures semantics by evaluating answer consis-\ntency (Kuhn et al., 2023), achieving higher align-\nment. Additionally, while verbalized confidence\nis uncalibrated, eliciting answer consistency-based\nconfidence calibrating a threshold on a held-out set,\nfurther improves alignment.\nDespite answer consistency-based confidence ex-\nhibiting high alignment, it comes at a cost: eliciting\nthis kind of confidence requires generating multi-\nple responses, incurring high computational costs.\nAnd its reliance on a held-out set for threshold cali-\nbration limits its generalizability.\n2) Probabilistic confidence surpasses verbal-\nized confidence in alignment performance. As\nshown in Table 1, probabilistic confidence\u2019s align-\nment performance consistently surpasses verbal-\nized confidence, and it outperforms answer consiste-\nncy-based confidence on Qwen2.5-VL. Though\nit falls behind consistency-based confidence on\nLLAVA-1.5 and DeepSeek-VL2, the alignment dif-\nferences are small. Additionally, it functions more\nefficiently without the high computational cost of\ngenerating multiple responses.\nHowever, probabilistic confidence, like answer\nconsistency-based confidence, still requires thresh-\nold calibration on a held-out set, which affects its\ngeneralizability.\n3) Verbalized confidence demonstrates lower\nalignment compared to probabilistic and answer\nconsistency-based confidences, and judges an-\nswers overconfidently. Compared to probabilistic\nand answer consistency-based confidences, elicit-\ning verbalized confidence is computationally ef-\nficient and generalizable. However, as shown in\nTable 1, both single-step (Vanilla) and double-step\n(Self-Jud) verbalized confidences\u2019 alignment are\n\nTable 2: The performance of verbalized confidence on\nQwen2.5-VL, single-step confidences are in blue and\ndouble-step confidences are in orange .\nmethod\nDyn-VQA\nVisual7W\nMMMU Pro\nConser.\nOverco.\nConser.\nOverco.\nConser.\nOverco.\nVanilla\n0.1024\n0.1353\n0.0900\n0.3260\n0.1327\n0.3764\nCoT\n0.0786\n0.1389\n0.1340\n0.2580\n0.1127\n0.2055\nPunish\n0.0804\n0.2084\n0.0820\n0.3660\n0.1127\n0.3873\nSelf-Jud\n0.0018\n0.6709\n0.0180\n0.4320\n0.0701\n0.3692\nCoT\n0.0329\n0.3236\n0.0280\n0.4020\n0.1000\n0.3745\nPunish\n0.0018\n0.6709\n0.0120\n0.4580\n0.0200\n0.4636\nlower than the other two confidences. To inves-\ntigate the cause of it, we calculate the conserva-\ntiveness and overconfidence on verbalized confi-\ndence, as shown in Table 2, we find that the ratio of\noverconfident responses is substantially higher than\nconservative responses. This pattern suggests that\nLVLMs, like LLMs, are intrinsically biased toward\naffirming their own output (Groot and Valdenegro-\nToro, 2024; Sun et al., 2025).\nTable 2 also shows that double-step verbalized\nconfidence exhibits more severe overconfidence\nthan its single-step counterpart. This may be be-\ncause the model\u2019s self-generated answers in the first\nround of dialogue serve as false positive signals of\nits capability, reinforcing overconfident behavior\nthrough misleading the model to self-affirmation.\n4.4.2\nConfidence Calibration in LVLMs\nIn this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of\nexisting confidence calibration methods developed\nfor LLMs in the context of LVLMs, as well as our\nproposed methods.\nFor existing confidence calibration methods, our\nobservations are as follows:\n1) Single-step reasoning elicitation methods ef-\nfectively enhance the accuracy and alignment of\nLVLMs. As shown in Table 1, we found reasoning\nelicitation methods (Explain, CoT, and Img-CoT)\nexhibit high alignment. To further investigate them,\nwe calculate other metrics about them. Table 3\nshows that different reasoning elicitation methods\nexcel on specific datasets: CoT method improves\nalignment and accuracy across all datasets and\ncauses overconfidence on Dyn-VQA. The Explain\nmethod outperforms CoT in alignment on Visual7W\nand Dyn-VQA datasets. This observed difference\nmay stem from the Explain method\u2019s design: while\nthe CoT method enforces step-by-step reasoning,\nthe Explain method prioritizes direct justification,\nthus reducing redundant context for simple ques-\ntions and improving the calibration of LVLMs\u2019 con-\nfidence outputs.\n2) Answer consistency-based confidence cali-\nbration methods improve alignment on Qwen2.5-\nVL, but show limited effectiveness on other mod-\nels. We observed that, even when sampling re-\nsponses at the same temperature of 1.0, models\ndiffer in their output diversity. As shown in Ta-\nble 1, when random sampling Qwen2.5-VL\u2019s re-\nsponses, it tends to generate consistent yet incorrect\nresponses, resulting in low alignment. However,\nboth the rephrasing and the noised image methods\nshow effectiveness in mitigating this tendency, con-\nsequently achieving higher alignment. In contrast,\nLLaVA-1.5 and DeepSeek-VL2 generate more di-\nverse outputs when the response is incorrect, al-\nlowing the Random Sampling method to perform\nwell and making Noised Image and Rephrasing\nmethods less effective in enhancing alignment by\ncomparison.\nWe propose Image Chain of Thought, Probabil-\nity Threshold, and Cross Model Consistency meth-\nods in Section 4.1, their performances are as fol-\nlows:\n1) Image Chain of Thought method effectively\nenhances alignment and accuracy on MMMU\nPro. As shown in Table 3, Img-CoT demonstrates\nremarkable performance on the MMMU Pro dataset,\nwhich requires both strong visual perception and\nreasoning capabilities. It improves accuracy and\nalignment, outperforming CoT method. This in-\ndicates that its mechanism for converting visual\nmodality into language modality can effectively\nenhance models\u2019 comprehension of the content in\nthe image, thereby achieving superior performance.\nHowever, it fails to improve alignment on Dyn-\nVQA and Visual7W datasets, as their images lack\ncomplex objects like sheet music or circuit dia-\ngrams which MMMU Pro contains. The forced\n\"describe the image\" process may lead to excessive\ndescriptions, creating false positives in capability\nassessment and increasing overconfidence. You\ncan refer to Appendix 4 for typical cases where\nImg-CoT makes the model overconfident, while\nthe CoT method does not.\n2) Probability Threshold method shows higher\nalignment than other double-step verbalizated\nconfidence calibration methods.\nAs shown in\nTable 1, the Probability Threshold method outper-\nforms alternative double-step methods. Despite\nthe need to calibrate the threshold, it effectively\nenhances alignment.\n\nTable 3: The performance of single-step reasoning elicitation methods on Qwen2.5-VL.\nmethod\nDyn-VQA\nVisual7W\nMMMU Pro\nAcc.\nAlign.\nOverco.\nAcc.\nAlign.\nOverco.\nAcc.\nAlign.\nOverco.\nVanilla\n0.1846\n0.7623\n0.1353\n0.4380\n0.5840\n0.3260\n0.4564\n0.4909\n0.3764\nCoT\n0.2121\n0.7824\n0.1389\n0.4920\n0.6080\n0.2580\n0.6436\n0.6818\n0.2055\nImg-CoT\n0.2048\n0.7276\n0.2066\n0.5020\n0.6060\n0.3080\n0.6636\n0.7182\n0.1691\nExplain\n0.1956\n0.8117\n0.0823\n0.4740\n0.6180\n0.2720\n0.5309\n0.5782\n0.2982\nTable 4: LLMs and LVLMs comparison for single-step verbalization based methods on Dyn-VQA.\nmethod\nModel\nQwen2.5\nDeepSeek-VL2\nLLaVA-1.5\nUnc-R.\nAcc\nAlign.\nConser.\nOverco.\nUnc-R.\nAcc\nAlign.\nConser.\nOverco.\nUnc-R.\nAcc\nAlign.\nConser.\nOverco.\nVanilla\nLVLM\n0.782\n0.185\n0.762\n0.102\n0.135\n0.788\n0.146\n0.653\n0.141\n0.207\n0.490\n0.088\n0.534\n0.022\n0.444\nLLM\n0.788\n0.285\n0.729\n0.172\n0.099\n0.161\n0.225\n0.338\n0.024\n0.638\n0.011\n0.141\n0.152\n0.001\n0.848\nCoT\nLVLM\n0.728\n0.212\n0.782\n0.079\n0.139\n0.638\n0.170\n0.636\n0.086\n0.278\n0.512\n0.084\n0.538\n0.031\n0.431\nLLM\n0.448\n0.294\n0.651\n0.046\n0.304\n0.095\n0.296\n0.362\n0.015\n0.623\n0.117\n0.199\n0.302\n0.007\n0.691\nPunish\nLVLM\n0.711\n0.168\n0.711\n0.080\n0.208\n0.848\n0.161\n0.709\n0.150\n0.141\n0.450\n0.095\n0.490\n0.027\n0.483\nLLM\n0.956\n0.294\n0.713\n0.269\n0.018\n0.266\n0.229\n0.455\n0.020\n0.525\n0.057\n0.152\n0.201\n0.004\n0.795\nExplain\nLVLM\n0.828\n0.196\n0.812\n0.106\n0.082\n0.786\n0.168\n0.698\n0.128\n0.174\n0.421\n0.084\n0.453\n0.027\n0.519\nLLM\n0.536\n0.298\n0.673\n0.080\n0.247\n0.079\n0.252\n0.320\n0.006\n0.675\n0.159\n0.219\n0.364\n0.007\n0.629\n3) Cross-Model Method Enhances Alignment\nfor Qwen2.5-VL As demonstrated in Table 1, the\nCross-Model method significantly outperforms other\nanswer consistency-based confidence calibration\napproaches for Qwen2.5-VL. Our results reveals\nthat under random sampling conditions, Qwen2.5-\nVL shows weaker alignment between its consis-\ntency scores and actual capabilities across all three\ndatasets compared to DeepSeek-VL2 and LLaVA-\nv1.5, which maintain stronger alignment.\nThe\nCross-Model approach addresses this limitation by\nincorporating responses from these better-aligned\nmodels, thereby improving the confidence calibra-\ntion and capability alignment for Qwen2.5-VL.\n5\nPerception Comparison Between\nLVLMs and LLMs\nCompared to LLMs, LVLMs need to process ad-\nditional visual modality and integrate information\nacross different modalities. This raises a question:\nhow does the perception of LVLMs differ from that\nof LLMs? Knowing these distinctions is valuable\nfor developing trustworthy LVLMs.\nIn this section, we investigate the difference of\nknowledge boundary perception between LVLMs\nand their LLM counterparts.\nFocusing on ver-\nbalized confidence cause it directly reflects mod-\nels\u2019 self-awareness of their knowledge boundaries.\nWe further propose several hypotheses about these\ndifferences\u2019 underlying causes and validate them\nthrough the comparison between different model\nscales and input modalities.\n5.1\nExperimental Setup\nDatasets. In this section, we mainly focus on Dyn-\nVQA dataset. Dyn-VQA provides both VQA ques-\ntion image pairs and their semantically equivalent\nQA questions (e.g., QA: \u201cHow many humans have\nlanded on Mars?\u201d vs. VQA: \u201cHow many humans\nhave landed on this planet?\u201d with an image of\nMars). This enables fair model performance com-\nparison across text-only modality and vision-text\nmodality inputs.\nModels. In this section, we compare LVLMs with\ntheir base LLM counterparts to ensure fair compar-\nison: Qwen2.5-VL, DeepSeek-VL2, LLaVA-v1.5\nvs Qwen2.5, DeepSeek-MoE, Vicuna-v1.5.\n5.2\nResults and Analysis\nHere, we apply VQA queries on LVLMs, and their\nsemantic equivalent QA queries on LLMs to fairly\ncompare them. And focus on single-step verbalized\nconfidence. We defer results about other kinds of\nconfidence to Appendix A.3. Here are our findings:\n1) Compared to LLMs, LVLMs struggle to\nfollow certain methods\u2019 instructions, leading\nto performance deviating from expected. As\nshown in Table 4, Qwen2.5-VL cannot effectively\nfollow the Punish instruction. As a result, this\nmethod not only fails to reduce overconfidence but\nactually exacerbates it, leading to lower alignment\nthan Vanilla. Similarly, LLaVA-1.5 disregards CoT\nand Explain instructions, persistently generating\nresponses without proper reasoning or explanation,\n\nFigure 2: Comparative analysis of instruction following ability across model scales.\nwhich results in lower accuracy. This stands in\ncontrast to LLMs, where the Punish method effec-\ntively reduces Qwen2.5\u2019s overconfidence; CoT and\nExplain instructions reliably ignite reasoning re-\nsponses in Vicuna-1.5, thus improving its accuracy.\n2) For single-step verbalized confidence, LVL-\nMs tend to have lower accuracy compared to\nLLMs. Along with higher alignment due to re-\nduced overconfidence. As shown in Table 4, under\nall single-step verbalized confidence for the three\nseries of models, the answer accuracy of LVLMs\nis lower than that of LLMs. Meanwhile, LVLMs\nexhibit a higher uncertain-rate compared to LLMs.\nSpecifically, LLaVA exhibits an average accuracy\nreduction of 0.09 with a concurrent 0.382 increase\nin uncertain-rate than its counterpart LLM. And\nin DeepSeek-VL2, we observe a 0.089 accuracy\ndecrement paired with a 0.615 surge in uncertainty\nthan LLM. Compared to LLMs, LVLMs\u2019 accuracy\ndrop is relatively smaller than their uncertain-rate\nincrease, thus they demonstrate less severe over-\nconfidence than LLMs, leading to relatively higher\nalignment in their responses.\n5.3\nAnalysis Across Model Scales and\nModalities\nBuilding upon the findings discussed in the previ-\nous subsection, we observe notable performance\ndistinctions between LLMs and LVLMs, which\nmotivate us to propose the following hypothesis\nregarding their potential underlying causes:\n1) Model capacity bottleneck: We hypothesize\nthat the inferior instruction-following abilities of\nLVLMs stems from their internal capacity limita-\ntions, where visual modality integration competes\nfor models\u2019 internal parameter resources that would\notherwise support language processing capabilities.\n2) Cross-modal limitation awareness: While the\nLVLMs demonstrate lower accuracy than LLMs,\ntheir verbalized confidence shows better alignment\nwith performance. We hypothesize this stems from\nTable 5: The performance of LVLMs under different\nquery modalities, we add text question at the bottom of\nthe image to generate pure image \u201cV\u201dQA query.\nModel\nTask\nDyn-VQA\nUnc-R.\nAcc\nAlign.\nConser.\nOverco.\nQwen2.5-VL\n\u201cV\u201dQA\n0.461\n0.223\n0.578\n0.053\n0.369\nVQA\n0.782\n0.185\n0.762\n0.102\n0.135\nQA\n0.766\n0.252\n0.700\n0.159\n0.141\nDeepSeek-VL2\n\u201cV\u201dQA\n0.227\n0.208\n0.435\n0.000\n0.565\nVQA\n0.788\n0.146\n0.653\n0.141\n0.207\nQA\n0.545\n0.256\n0.559\n0.121\n0.320\ntwo factors: (1) LVLMs\u2019 constrained cross-modal\nprocessing ability leads to degraded multimodal\nVQA accuracy, and (2) LVLMs\u2019 awareness of this\nlimitation results in higher alignment.\nTo validate our capacity hypothesis of instruc-\ntion following ability, we conduct a comparative\nanalysis on different scale models and find that:\nAs LVLMs scale up, they generally exhibit\nstronger instruction following capabilities. As\nshown in Figure 2. For Qwen2.5-VL and DeepSeek-\nVL2, the Punish method effectively reduces over-\nconfidence in larger models (Qwen2.5-VL-72B,\nDeepSeek-Vl2-16B) but shows limited impact on\nsmaller ones ( < 32B Qwen2.5-VL, DeepSeek-\nVL2-3B). For LLaVA-1.5, the 13B model follows\nExplain instruction which 7B model not follows,\nthus Explain improves accuracy in the 13B model.\nThese phenomena supports our hypothesis: the\nparameter constraints of small scale LVLMs create\na dilemma between visual processing and linguis-\ntic comprehension, resulting in degraded language\nunderstanding and consequently weaker instruc-\ntion following ability. In contrast, larger LVLMs\nallocate more parameters to language processing,\nmaintaining strong language ability while handling\nmultimodal inputs, thus demonstrating stronger in-\nstruction following ability.\nTo validate our accuracy and alignment hypothe-\nsis, we conduct comparative analysis on text-only\nQA, vision-text VQA, and vision-only \"V\"QA mod-\nality of queries on LVLMs, our results reveal that:\n\nS\nNe}\n\nS\nNy\n\nOverconfidence\nco \u00b0o\nWw Nn\n\nS\n\n8 Vanilla\nM8 Punish\n\n3B 16B\nDeepSeek-VL2 -- Punish\n\n\nS\nnv\n\nSo\nK\n\nS\nbo\n\nSo\n\nOverconfidence\nN\n\n8 Vanilla\nM8 Punish\n\nS\nan\n\ndl\n\n3B 7B 32B = 72B\nQwen2.5-VL -- Punish\n\n\n[mm Vanilla\nMam Explain\nMS CoT\n\n7B 13B\nLLaVA-v1.5 -- Explain & CoT\n\nLVLMs exhibit lower accuracy but higher\nalignment when responding to multimodal VQA\nqueries. As shown in Table 5, both models demon-\nstrate lower accuracy when answering VQA queries\nthat demand cross-modal understanding ability com-\npared to pure text QA and pure image \u201cV\u201dQA\nqueries. Concurrently, they demonstrate increased\nuncertain-rate and improved confidence performan-\nce alignment for these multimodal queries.\nThese observations support our hypothesis:\n1. Limited cross-modal ability: LVLMs struggle\nto effectively synthesize information across modal-\nities, leading to reduced answering accuracy on\nmultimodal queries compared to unimodal queries.\n2. Capability awareness: When encountering\nchallenging multimodal queries, LVLMs exhibit\nself-awareness of their limited ability through gen-\nerating more uncertainty responses. This decreases\noverconfidence and thus improves alignment.\n6\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we present a systematic investigation\nof knowledge boundary perception in LVLMs, as-\nsessing this ability through alignment. First, we\nevaluate three kinds of confidence, and observe that\nanswer consistency-based confidence reaches the\nhighest alignment, whereas verbalized confidence\ninduces overconfidence. We also evaluate several\nconfidence calibration methods, with our results\nrevealing that reasoning elicitation methods im-\nprove accuracy and alignment, while our proposed\nmethods show effectiveness. Second, we compare\nLVLMs with LLMs, and reveal that while LVLMs\nexhibit lower QA accuracy, they achieve higher\nalignment, which is attributable to LVLMs\u2019 aware-\nness of their multimodal integration ability limita-\ntion. We also observe that LVLMs have weaker\ninstruction following ability than LLMs.\nLimitations\nFirst, due to dataset constraints, we only compared\nLVLMs and LLMs on Dyn-VQA; broader bench-\nmarks are needed for future validation. Second,\nour analysis did not examine internal model states,\nleaving internal mechanistic differences in knowl-\nedge boundary perception underexplored. Third,\nwe focused on binary confidence measures; extend-\ning this to continuous confidence scales could yield\nfiner-grained insights. These limitations highlight\ndirections for future work on LVLM evaluation and\ninterpretability.\nEthics Statement\nIn this paper, all the datasets we use are open-\nsource, and the models we employ are either open-\nsource or widely used. Furthermore, the methods\nwe propose do not induce the model to output any\nharmful information.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was funded by the National Natural Sci-\nence Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant\nNo. 62302486, the Innovation Project of ICT CAS\nunder Grant No. E361140, and the CAS Special\nResearch Assistant Funding Project.\nReferences\nAyush Agrawal, Mirac Suzgun, Lester Mackey, and\nAdam Tauman Kalai. 2024.

No-\ntably, Probability Threshold method is exclusively\nemployed in a double round form because we find\nsome of the models struggle to generate both con-\ntinuous probabilities and answers in a single round.\nFor the consistency based methods, we imple-\nmente a two-phase generation protocol: First, gen-\nerating a reference answer with temperature = 0;\nThen sampling 10 variant answers with tempera-\nture = 1.0, with semantic equivalence between the\nbasic answer and sampled answers evaluated by\nQwen2.5-0.5B. With this process, we can get a\nconsistency score between 0 to 10.\nSpecifically, for question rephrasing method, we\nleveraged Qwen2.5-7B to produce semantically\nequivalent question paraphrases. For the noised\nimage method, we progressively added zero-mean\nGaussian noise to the images during sampling, with\nthe standard deviation incrementally increased from\n0 in steps of 0.05. And for the cross model con-\nsistency method, we computed consistency scores\nusing a combination of four responses generated by\nthe primary model and three responses each from\ntwo other reference models.\nA.2.2\nComplete Results\nTable 6, Table 7 and Table 8 present the comprehen-\nsive performance evaluation of all methods across\nthe three benchmark datasets and three LVLMs\nemployed in our study.\nA.2.3\nObservations and Analysis\nWe proposed our mainly findings about LVLMs\u2019\nknowledge boundary perception methods in Sec-\ntion 4.4. Here, we discuss more detailed observa-\ntions about them.\n1) The Explain method improves alignment for\nboth Deepseek-VL2 and Qwen2.5 when tested on\nthe Dyn-VQA and Visual7W datasets. This demon-\nstrates its effectiveness in enhancing LVLMs\u2019 knowl-\nedge boundary perception when processing rela-\ntively simple input questions.\n2) The single-step Chain of Thought method\neffectively enhances alignment, whereas its double-\nstep counterpart often leads to overconfidence and\nonly marginally improves alignment for Qwen2.5-\nVL.\n3) Both single-step and double-step Punish meth-\nods demonstrate limited effectiveness in mitigating\noverconfidence for Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA-v1.5,\nas they fail to properly follow Punish Instructions.\n4) Challenge method induces very high uncertain-\nrate in both three models, indicating that LVLMs\nare easily swayed by the output judgements.\n5) For Qwen2.5-VL, rephrasing methods im-\nprove alignment on the Dyn-VQA dataset (language-\nfocused), while the noise image method enhances\nperformance on Visual7W (vision-focused). The\ncombination of these two methods boosts align-\nment on the MMMU Pro dataset, which requires\nboth language and vision comprehension. This\nreveals an interesting relationship between pertur-\nbation modalities and input query types.\nA.3\nComparing Perception between LVLMs\nand LLMs\nWhile the main body presents a comparative anal-\nysis of single-step verbalization based confidence\nelicitation methods between LLMs and LVLMs,\nthis section provides an extensive evaluation of: (i)\ndouble step verbalization based methods, (ii) an-\nswer consistency based methods, and (iii) token\nprobability based method. The results can be found\nin Table 9. The main observations are as follows.\nA.3.1\nDouble Step Verbalization Based\nMethods\nFor double step verbalization based methods, the\ndifference in performance between LLM and LVLM\nvaries with the method.\n1) For the Self-Judging method, Qwen2.5 ex-\nhibits higher alignment than Qwen2.5-VL. In con-\ntrast, the LLM counterparts of DeepSeek-VL2 and\nLLaVA tend to respond with \u201ccertain\u201d to nearly\nall answers, resulting in extremely low consistency.\nThis indicates a severe bias toward overconfident\nresponses in these two LLMs.\n2) For the Challenge method, LVLMs demon-\nstrate higher uncertain-rates than LLMs, often ap-\nproaching to near 1.0. This suggests that LVLMs\nare more likely to trust external judgments and con-\nsequently undermine their own decisions.\n3) Under the Double-step Punish method, LLMs\noutperform LVLMs due to their stronger instruction\n\nfollowing ability, achieving higher consistency and\nlower overconfidence.\nA.3.2\nAnswer Consistency Based Methods\nFor answer consistency based methods, our obser-\nvations are as follows:\n1) Answer consistency based methods demon-\nstrate superior alignment performance in LVLMs\ncompared to LLMs.\n2) DeepSeek-MoE exhibits strong consistency in\nits generated answers, maintaining high answer uni-\nformity even when the outputs are incorrect. This\nbehavior persists across both random sampling and\nrephrasing methods, leading to sustained overcon-\nfidence and suboptimal alignment performance.\n3) The rephrasing strategy shows limited effec-\ntiveness in improving alignment metrics across all\nevaluated models, with the notable exception of\nQwen2.5-VL. This observation holds true for both\nLVLMs and LLMs in our results.\nA.3.3\nToken Probability Based Methods\nFor the token probability based approach, as shown\nin Table 9, our results reveal that LLMs exhibit\nrelatively weaker confidence-accuracy alignment\ncompared to LVLMs.\nA.4\nCase Study of LVLM Outputs\nA.4.1\nCoT vs Img-CoT\nAs shown in Figure 3, In this case, the model gen-\nerates extensive image descriptions under the Img-\nCoT method and confidently confirms its answer\nwhile the answer is wrong, demonstrating overcon-\nfidence.\nA.5\nSmall Scale LVLMs vs Large Scale\nLVLMs\nAs illustrated in Figure 4, we observe a notable dif-\nference in instruction following behavior between\nLLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaVA-v1.5-14B. While the\n7B model fails to adhere to the Explain instruc-\ntion, the 14B variant successfully generates both\nexplanatory sentences and the correct answer.\nSimilarly, Figure 5 highlights a contrast in in-\nstruction following performance between Qwen2.5-\n7B and Qwen2.5-72B. The smaller 7B model ex-\nhibits overconfidence, incorrectly judging the an-\nswer without following the Punish instruction, whereas\nthe 72B model responds more conservatively, align-\ning with the given directive.\n\nFigure 3: Img-CoT and CoT methods\u2019 performance comparison. The description of the image is in underline\nFigure 4: Different scale LLaVA-v1.5\u2019s performance under the Explain instruction, The explanation of the answer is\nin blue.\n\nImage:\n\nQuestion: How many flights has this system launched?\n\nQwen2.5-VL-7B's CoT response: The image shows a rocket on a launch\n\npad, which appears to be the Saturn V rocket used for NASA's Apollo\n\nmissions. The Saturn V was used for six manned spaceflights as part of\n\nthe Apollo program. Uncertain\n\nQwen2.5-VL-7B's Img-CoT response: The image shows a rocket on a\nlaunch pad, illuminated by bright lights, likely during a nighttime launch.\nThe rocket appears to be part of the Saturn V family, which was used for\nNASA's Apollo missions and Skylab program. Step 1: Identify the rocket\nsystem. - The rocket in the image is consistent with the Saturn V, which\nwas a powerful American expendable launch system used by NASA. Step\n2: Determine the number of flights. - The Saturn V launched six times: -\nApollo 4 (uncrewed test flight) - Apollo 6 (uncrewed test flight) - Apollo\n7 - Apollo 8 - Apollo 11 - Apollo 13 Therefore, the Saturn V system has\nlaunched six flights. Certain\n\nAnswer: one\n\nImage:\n\nQuery: Answer the question based on your internal knowledge and the\nimage, explain why you give this answer. If you are sure the answer is\naccurate and correct, please say \"certain\" after the answer. If you are not\nconfident with the answer, please say \"uncertain\" after the answer.\n\nQuestion: The 1939 German invasion of this country began soon after\n\nGermany signed a non-aggression pact with what other nation?\n\nLLaVA-v1.5-7B response: Poland.

However, reliance on \u2019black box\u2019 software such as\nMAXQDA and NVivo risks undermining methodological transparency and alignment with research\ngoals. This paper presents a hybrid, transparent framework for QDA that combines lexical (bag-of-\nwords, n-grams) and semantic (sentence embeddings, BERTopic) methods to enable triangulation,\nreproducibility, and interpretability. Drawing from a case study in historical political discourse, we\ndemonstrate how custom Python pipelines using NLTK, spaCy, and Sentence Transformers allow fine-\ngrained control over preprocessing, lemmatisation, and embedding generation. We further detail our\niterative BERTopic modelling process\u2014incorporating UMAP dimensionality reduction, HDBSCAN\nclustering, and c-TF-IDF keyword extraction\u2014optimised through parameter tuning and multiple\nruns to enhance topic coherence and coverage. By juxtaposing precise lexical searches with context-\naware semantic clustering, we argue for a multi-layered approach that mitigates the limitations of\neither method in isolation. Our workflow underscores the importance of code-level transparency,\nresearcher agency, and methodological triangulation in computational discourse studies. Code and\nsupplementary materials are available via GitHub.\n1\nIntroduction\nQuantitative Discourse Analysis (QDA) plays a critical role in validating qualitative claims by demon-\nstrating that selected textual evidence reflects broader patterns within a corpus. As computational tools\nbecome increasingly accessible, researchers are turning to Large Language Models (LLMs) and automated\ntext analysis platforms to process large-scale historical and social datasets (Kim et al., 2025; Murugaraj,\nLamsiyah and Schommer, 2025). While these tools offer efficiency, treating them as \u2019black boxes\u2019 risks\nmisalignment between research goals and model capabilities (Cigliano, Fallucchi and Gerardi, 2024; Benz\net al., 2025; Wang et al., 2024). This paper presents a transparent, reproducible framework for QDA\nthat integrates lexical and semantic methods to support interpretative rigour.\nWe argue that combining bag-of-words (BOW) frequency analysis with sentence embedding-based\ntopic modelling (via BERTopic) enables methodological triangulation. This hybrid approach ensures\nboth precision in term detection and sensitivity to contextual meaning. Our implementation leverages\nPython, NLTK, spaCy, and Sentence Transformers, allowing full control over preprocessing and model\nfine-tuning. We evaluate multiple embedding models and report coherence, coverage, and structural\nmetrics to justify our final model choice.\nCode and data are available at https://github.com/UnbrokenCocoon/BERTopic_Stability/.\n2\nBackground and Related Work\nThe integration of computational methods into discourse analysis has accelerated with the public avail-\nability of LLMs. These models assist in OCR transcription (Kim et al., 2025), summarization (Muru-\ngaraj, Lamsiyah and Schommer, 2025), and unsupervised pattern detection. However, scholars caution\nagainst uncritical use of commercial software such as MAXQDA and NVivo, which often obscure pre-\nprocessing steps and clustering logic (Cigliano, Fallucchi and Gerardi, 2024; Benz et al., 2025; Wang et\nal., 2024).\n1\narXiv:2508.19099v1  [cs.CL]  26 Aug 2025\n\nTopic modeling has evolved from Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei, Ng and Jordan, 2003) to\ncontext-aware models like BERTopic (Grootendorst, 2022), which uses sentence embeddings and clus-\ntering. BERTopic outperforms LDA in capturing semantic nuance, especially in short or heterogeneous\ntexts (Benz et al., 2025; Nanyonga et al., 2025). However, its stochastic nature and parameter sensitivity\nrequire careful optimisation (Kumar, Karamchandani and Singh, 2024).\nOur work builds on calls for transparency (Al-Zaman and Rashid, 2025) and multi-layered analysis\n(Zeng, 2024), advocating for researcher-led pipelines that balance automation with interpretative control.\n3\nChallenges in Quantitative Discourse Analysis\nThree key challenges hinder robust QDA: complexity, accuracy, and transparency.\nComplexity creates barriers for non-technical researchers. While \u2019plug-and-play\u2019 tools lower entry\nthresholds, they often prevent fine-tuning, leading to suboptimal alignment between research questions\nand model outputs (Cigliano, Fallucchi and Gerardi, 2024). In contrast, coding-based approaches (e.g.,\nPython) enable customization but require technical literacy.\nAccuracy varies across methods. Lexical approaches like BOW count exact term matches (e.g.,\n\u201ccommunity\u201d), enabling precise frequency counts. However, they ignore morphology (e.g., \u201ccommuni-\nties\u201d) and context. Lemmatisation\u2014implemented via spaCy\u2014resolves this by reducing words to root\nforms (Bagheri, Entezarian and Sharifi, 2023). Yet, commercial tools like MAXQDA and NVivo often\nlack such features, producing inconsistent frequencies.\nTransparency is compromised when models operate as black boxes. Without access to preprocessing\nor clustering logic, researchers cannot assess reliability. Custom code, referencing NLTK and SpaCy\ndocumentation, allows full auditability and reproducibility.\n4\nMethodological Framework\nWe adopt a hybrid framework combining:\n\u2022 Lexical methods: BOW and n-grams for precise term frequency and collocation analysis.\n\u2022 Semantic methods: Sentence embeddings and BERTopic for context-aware clustering.\nThis dual approach enables triangulation: lexical results ground findings in observable counts, while\nsemantic outputs reveal framing and discourse structure.\n4.1\nLexical Analysis\nWe generate:\n\u2022 Bag-of-Words (BOW): Frequency-normalized term counts.\n\u2022 n-grams: Bigrams and trigrams to contextualize key terms (e.g., \u201cpublic campaign\u201d, \u201ccommunity\naction\u201d).\nThese are used deductively (searching for predefined terms) and inductively (identifying top frequent\nitems).\nTable 1: Top 5 Bigrams Containing \u2019Education\u2019\nBigram\nCount\n(\u201ctechnical\u201d, \u201ceducation\u201d)\n23\n(\u201csecondary\u201d, \u201ceducation\u201d)\n19\n(\u201cboard\u201d, \u201ceducation\u201d)\n16\n(\u201ceducation\u201d, \u201ccommittee\u201d)\n13\n(\u201ceducation\u201d, \u201cauthority\u201d)\n12\nThe bigrams table suggests that the union was concerned with the education of young people, with\nparticular interest in the \u2018technical\u2019 (23) education of apprentices. A frequency of 23 places \u2018technical\u2019\nand \u2018education\u2019 in the 99.62th percentile, making them comparatively high.\n2\n\nIn this approach, I focus on percentiles as a representation of frequency within the text, as bigram\nfrequency in isolation does not provide analytic value. Another approach could use percentages, but\npercentiles are useful in indicating frequency within a Zipfian distribution, as the majority of terms\nwithin all bigrams are liable to be low frequency.\nHowever, inferences should be drawn from a combination of approaches, where bigrams and their\nfrequencies assist in understanding important ideas based on their frequency. To supplement this, using\nthe total lemmas (through spaCy) can provide a more general view of a term\u2019s usage. For example,\nlemmas containing \u2018apprentice\u2019 total 147 (95.82th percentile). It will be for the discretion of the user\nto determine what threshold determines the significance of a term\u2019s usage, but beyond the 90th or 95th\npercentile may be useful lines in the sand.\n4.2\nSemantic Analysis\nWe use sentence embeddings to represent text contextually. Sentences are embedded using pre-trained\nmodels, then clustered via BERTopic to detect latent themes.\n5\nImplementation: BERTopic Pipeline\nOur BERTopic workflow (Table 2) includes manual and automated steps:\nTable 2: BERTopic Processing Pipeline\nStep\nProcess Type\nDescription\nPre-processing\nManual\nSplit corpus into sentences of even length\nEmbedding\nManual\nUse all-mpnet-base-v2 to generate 768D vectors\nDimensionality Reduction\nInternal\nApply UMAP to reduce to 2D\nClustering\nInternal\nHDBSCAN groups similar sentences\nKeyword Extraction\nInternal\nc-TF-IDF retrieves top 10 terms per topic\nTopic Refinement\nManual\nMerge, rename, select 15 final topics\nOutput\nManual\nSave, visualize, evaluate\nWe selected all-mpnet-base-v2 after evaluating five embedding models (Table 4).\nThis model\nbalances coherence, topic distribution, and runtime.\n6\nModel Evaluation and Selection\nTable 3: Corpus Statistics: Sentence Length Distribution\nCorpus\nTotal Sentences\nAvg Length\nMin Length\nMax Length\n\u00a15 Words\n\u00bf25 Words\nB&S\n95,557\n15.22\n5\n270\n0\n4,763\nTo select the optimal embedding model, we ran BERTopic on five precomputed embeddings and\ncompared outcomes across six metrics.

Whereas all-mpnet-base-v2\nis a popular embedding model because of its higher accuracy. Many may choose the former over the\nlatter for speed; however, the results show the latter had a marginally faster BERTopic speed. This\nis calculated using pre-computed embeddings, so it does not reflect the time taken to pre-compute the\nembeddings.\ndistilroberta-base was found less frequently within the literature, but performed well in terms\nof outliers, topics, and Gini Score, demonstrating a good distribution of topics produced. This may\nsuggest this model is being overlooked.\nWhereas bge-small-en-v1.5 is a baseline of BGE, with\nmpnet-distilled trained using BGE\u2019s sentence similarity scores. This suggests that BGE performs\nwell at similarity tasks but is not as appropriate for BERTopic.\nWhile mpnet-distilled achieved the highest coherence (0.26), it produced fewer topics and neg-\native silhouette, indicating cluster overlap. bge-small-en-v1.5 showed high Gini (0.867), suggesting\ndominance by a few large topics, and poor cluster separation. all-mpnet-base-v2 offered a balanced\ntrade-off: moderate coherence (0.09), high topic count (584), and neutral silhouette\u2014making it ideal for\nexploratory discourse analysis.\n7\nDiscussion\nOur hybrid approach demonstrates that lexical and semantic methods are not competing but comple-\nmentary. BOW analysis provides auditable, reproducible counts (e.g., frequency of \u201ccommunity\u201d), while\nBERTopic reveals how the term is framed\u2014e.g., in relation to solidarity, activism, or governance.\nThe stochastic nature of BERTopic necessitates multiple runs and parameter tuning (Kumar, Karam-\nchandani and Singh, 2024). We mitigated this by testing configurations and selecting the most coherent,\nwell-distributed output. Manual topic refinement ensured interpretability, aligning with qualitative dis-\ncourse goals.\nCrucially, custom coding in Python enabled transparency and fine-tuning\u2014unavailable in MAXQDA/NVivo.\nHowever, this demands technical investment. We advocate for interdisciplinary training to bridge this\ngap.\n8\nConclusion and Future Work\nWe presented a transparent, triangulated framework for QDA using lexical and semantic methods. By\nevaluating embedding models and justifying model selection empirically, we promote methodological\nrigor in computational discourse studies.\nThe argument is to focus on triangulation with NLP approaches, focusing on working in concert with\nqualitative insights and quantitative metrics. This recognises that each approach has advantages and\nlimitations. Therefore, models can be used not to replace qualitative approaches but to complement\nthem.\nData and Code Availability\nThe code, preprocessed data, and model outputs are available at: https://github.com/UnbrokenCocoon/\nBERTopic_Stability/\n4\n\nReferences\n\u2022 Al-Zaman, S. and Rashid, M., 2025.

Provenance Research establishes the ownership \nhistory of artworks, which is essential for verifying authenticity, supporting restitution and legal \nclaims, and understanding the cultural and historical context of art objects. The process is \ncomplicated by fragmented, multilingual archival data that hinders efficient retrieval. Current \nsearch portals require precise metadata, limiting exploratory searches. Our method enables \nnatural-language and multilingual searches through semantic retrieval and contextual \nsummarization, reducing dependence on metadata structures. We assess RAG's capability to \nretrieve and summarize auction records using a 10,000-record sample from the Getty Provenance \nIndex \u2013 German Sales. The results show this approach provides a scalable solution for navigating \nart market archives, offering a practical tool for historians and cultural heritage professionals \nconducting historically sensitive research. \nIntroduction \nThe provenance of an artwork is the \u2018ownership history of a work of art\u2019 (Gerstenblith, 2019), \nand in recent years, many new digital resources have been offered for conducting Provenance \nResearch. One of the leading tools is the Getty Provenance Index (GPI), which is noted as \novercoming significant challenges in the availability of digital data to researchers (Sallabedra, \n2024). Provenance Research is essential for understanding the historical context of cultural \nobjects, particularly those affected by Nazi looting (Fuhrmeister & Hopp, 2019). This research is \nstill a time-intensive discipline, hindered by dispersed archival sources and limited funding. \nFuhrmeister and Hopp (2019) noted that one museum estimated that it would take 274 years to \ncatalogue just 7,000 paintings, underscoring the scale of the challenge. The problem we sought \nto address is how the latest search technology can make information retrieval from such \nresources more efficient and accessible for researchers to improve upon the current standards of \nonline search portals.  \nThe Getty Provenance Index and the Role of RAG in Modern Provenance Research \nThe Getty Provenance Index (GPI) is one of the most widely used digitised provenance datasets \navailable to researchers. It provides access to over 1 million records from auction catalogues, \ndealer stock books, and archival inventories, many of which are otherwise inaccessible or \ndispersed across European institutions. As Schuhmacher (2024) notes, the GPI has become a \ncornerstone for Provenance Research, particularly in the context of Nazi-era art sales and \nrestitution efforts. Fuhrmeister and Hopp (2019) argue that Provenance Research must now \ncontend with vast, multilingual, and fragmented data ecosystems, and that scalable, \ninterdisciplinary tools are essential to meet the demands of restitution, transparency, and \n\nhistorical accountability. By combining semantic retrieval with generative summarisation, RAG \nenables researchers to query large corpora using natural language searches to reveal relevant \nrecords and generate explainable summaries grounded in a given context. This is particularly \nvaluable when metadata is incomplete or inconsistently structured, as RAG can infer relevance \nfrom embedded semantic cues rather than relying on rigid keyword matching. As Provenance \nResearch increasingly shifts toward scalable and explainable RAG is a conceptually aligned and \ntechnically practical approach. \nConceptual Problem Statement \nWe proposed a framework that uses text encoding, specifically RAG, to search digitised art \nprovenance archives. RAG retrieves semantically relevant data from a source document corpus \nand passes it to a Large Language Model (LLM), which processes the information and returns a \nuser-friendly summary (Lewis et al., 2020). This prototype is designed to enable more flexible \nand efficient retrieval of provenance information from the GPI, with the goal of accelerating and \nenhancing Provenance Research. Researchers face the central issue of tracing specific object \nhistories and having to search databases that only handle targeted queries. Targeted queries are \ndefined as those where prior knowledge of specific metadata is required to optimally retrieve \ninformation. A technique that can handle broader, exploratory, and more thematic queries could \nsignificantly improve this. We addressed this issue using a RAG solution to retrieve information \nin a semantically flexible manner to enhance object searches.  \nTo summarise, our objectives for the RAG prototype are the following:  \n\uf095 Enable flexible, natural-language queries, such as \u2018find me paintings records of paintings by \n[artist name] that contain motifs of family and social activities,\u2019 without requiring precise \nmetadata knowledge.  \n\uf095 Support multilingual semantic search, enabling non-German language queries to retrieve \nrelevant content from German-language archives. This applies to many major languages when \ninteracting with the search tool.  \n\uf095 Incorporate semantic-aware retrieval, where the given search terms are automatically expanded \nto include related or synonymous concepts\u2014e.g., a query for  Portr\u00e4t   also retrieves results \nfeaturing   Mannerbildnis  (male portrait) or  Bildnis  (German language for portrait).  \n \nRelated Work \nRecent studies have increasingly explored the intersection of AI and cultural heritage and \nhighlighted an increasing focus on the integration of such tools into the Humanities. G\u00eerbacia \n(2024) showed key trends in the application of AI across heritage domains, emphasising the role \nof semantic technologies. Shinde et al. (2024) provided a systematic review of AI in archival \nscience, highlighting parallels with Provenance Research in data structuring and retrieval. \nBushey (2024) investigated visual AI in archival contexts, suggesting opportunities for \nmultimodal extensions of text-based systems. Zou and Lin (2024) presented case studies on AI in \n\nconservation, underscoring the value of interdisciplinary approaches. Together, these studies \nunderline the relevance of integrating AI-based techniques into information retrieval in the \nHumanities and point toward future enhancements such as multilingual support and hybrid \nretrieval strategies. This study addressed a gap in the current literature, namely, the application \nof semantic retrieval for Provenance Research and art historical research. This study builds on \ndevelopments made by the Getty Research Institute in providing large-scale art market datasets \nfor Provenance Research (Frederiksen, 1999), with a particular focus on Nazi-era provenance. In \n2011, the Getty, in collaboration with the University of Heidelberg and the Berlin Art Library, \ndigitised over 3,200 auction catalogues. Schumacher highlights the value of the Getty \nProvenance Index (GPI), describing it as 'short-circuiting searches that could otherwise take \nyears.' Meike Hopp (2023) characterises Provenance Research as a Daueraufgabe\u2014a permanent \ntask\u2014and calls for greater infrastructure and interdisciplinary collaboration.  \nAlthough digitisation has improved access, the application of RAG techniques, introduced by \nLewis et al. (2020) in art market and art historical research, is limited. RAG based techniques are \nbecoming an increasingly significant role in industry and academia for smarter information \nretrieval (Hongliu et al. 2024), yet there is a gap in the application of such techniques in art \nhistorical domains, where there is a need for effective and flexible information search \nframeworks. This study builds on these technologies to propose a prototype framework for AI-\nassisted Provenance Research, addressing a critical gap in the interdisciplinary application of \nRAG to cultural heritage data, specifically Provenance Research.  \nStudy Aims and Structure \nThe aim of our study was to evaluate the viability of RAG for information retrieval in \nProvenance Research. We tested a RAG framework using high-performing propriety models \nfrom OpenAI (Caspari et al. 2024) and used a combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics \nto evaluate both the retrieval and end outputs compared with the original input search question. \nThe following framework is intended as a complementary tool to the established search portals \navailable to researchers. Its aim is to fulfil the role of a multilingual information retrieval \nassistant capable of searching for semantically similar matches across auction catalogue text. \nBy doing so we show the potential of RAG to make searches more flexible and efficient, while \nbroadening the potential research audience by introducing multi-lingual semantic searches for \nthe first time to the GPI dataset.   Many combinations of text embedding models and text \nsummarisation models are available, but we limited the scope of our study to evaluating RAG as \na technique using established propriety models. B \nA prototype pipeline using text vectorisation (OpenAI text-embedding-3-large), vector storage \n(FAISS), and GPT4o (OpenAI) for retrieval summarisation is outlined along with its practical \nevaluation for the discipline. We chose OpenAI text-embedding-3-large for our text encoding \nowing to its robust performance in granular semantic retrieval and text embedding benchmarks \n(Harris et al., 2024). FAISS was selected as the vector index owing to its extensive use in \nacademic and commercial retrieval systems (Douze et al. \u2013 Meta. 2024), its support for high-\n\ndimensional and large-scale vector searches, and its flexibility in indexing strategies (e.g. flat, \nIVF, and HNSW). FAISS enables efficient similarity search across millions of vectors (Douze et \nal., 2019), making it well-suited for evaluating retrieval performance in domain-specific corpora, \nsuch as historical auction catalogues. To evaluate the RAG framework, we selected a 10 K-\nrecord sample from the GPI. This size provides sufficient scale to test retrieval performance \nwhile maintaining practical efficiency for iterative experimentation. The full GPI contains \napproximately 830 K records; our sample was drawn using random selection to preserve \nrepresentativeness across the dataset. \nWhen preparing auction records for processing, our priority was to keep the end-to-end model as \nsimple and transparent as possible for non-technical users. This informed our decision to avoid \nmetadata filtering. While metadata filters can be useful in technical contexts, they introduce an \nadditional layer of logic that would need to be explained and justified to users unfamiliar with \ndata engineering. Our aim was to offer a tool the only requirement is to input a natural language \nquery. Removing metadata logic helps avoid unnecessary complexity and keeps the interface \nconceptually clean. To retain the richness of metadata without introducing technical barriers, we \nopted for text augmentation by embedding key metadata fields directly into the auction record \ntext. By integrating metadata into the textual content, we preserved important information, such \nas sale date, auction house, or catalogue number, while maintaining a single, unified input stream \nfor the model. This means that users can still retrieve metadata-relevant results simply by \nphrasing their query naturally without needing to know which fields exist or how to structure a \nfilter. This design choice supported our broader aim: to offer a conceptually simple tool that \nenables historians and other non-technical users to explore the dataset using natural language \nalone while still using the full informational depth of the records. \nThe prototype architecture is outlined as follows: For ease of reference, some of the pipeline \nstages are aggregated. \n \n \n \nFig 1. - an overview of the RAG workflow \n\nant\nRecords + Task\n\nant Fo\nPrompt\n\n\nGao et al. (2024) outlined the distinct types of RAG techniques currently available. The \ntechnique presented in this study can be classified as a Naive RAG implementation, enhanced \nwith select Advanced RAG features\u2014notably semantic text augmentation and structured prompt \ndesign\u2014to improve usability and retrieval quality in the context of Provenance Research. \nHowever, the addition of further features is intentionally limited to favour ease of conceptual \nunderstanding by end users. The study, owing to its interdisciplinary end-user audience and \napplication, targets a simpler implementation than some of the latest architectures (see Self-RAG \nAkari et al., 2024, Adaptive RAG, Soyeong et al., 2024). This is a key consideration because \npotential future users of the search capability must be able to conceptually understand the \nmechanics of the pipeline. AI solutions can be powerful but suffer from a \u2018black box\u2019 effect \nwhere end users can tend to be sceptical of end results of how they work. Explainability, \ninterpretability, and understandability (Tang et al., 2019) are, therefore, paramount when \nadapting such technologies for a discipline where trust and reliability play a vital role.  \nMethodology \nOur RAG pipeline aligns most closely with the Naive RAG paradigm as defined by Gao et al. \n(2024), with select enhancements -such as semantic text augmentation and structured prompt \ndesign - that support usability and interpretability needed in Provenance Research.  \nThe stages of our RAG prototype from data preparation and encoding to final retrieval are \ndescribed in detail below. \n\uf095 Text Augmentation for Semantic Retrieval. Raw auction catalogue entries were enriched with \nkey metadata fields (artist, object type, auction house, material, dimensions, title or description, \nauction date URL link to the original scanned catalogue). This enriched format ensured that all \nrelevant information is embedded into the text, simplifying retrieval and avoiding the need for \nhybrid search methods. To further justify the choice of text enrichment vs. metadata filtering, \nwe noted that there are some significant inconsistencies and spelling variations in the metadata, \nwhere simple filtering based on lexical matching may fail and miss relevant records. This \napproach also removed some of the technical complexities of hybrid searches and metadata \nfiltering (Sawarkar et al. 2025).  \n \nAn example of augmented text from the available data is included below:  \nAuction House: Fischer Sale Date: 1939-06-30 00:00:00 Artist: Dix, Otto Title: Mutter \nund Kind. Vor efeuumranktem, dunklem Mauerwerk Kniest\u00fcck einer frontalsitzenden \nblonden Frau mit dunkler ge\u00f6ffneter Jacke. Sie h\u00e4lt auf dem Schoss ihren S\u00e4ugling in \nzinnoberrotem Strickj\u00e4ckchen. Rechts oben Ausblick auf blauen Himmel. Signiert rechts \nunten: O D 1924. Oel auf Leinwand, 76/70 cm. K\u00f6nigsberg/Pr., St\u00e4dtische \nKunstsammlungen. Object Type: Gem\u00e4lde Metadata: {'source': 'http://digi.ub.uni-\nheidelberg.de/diglit/fischer1939_06_30', 'sale_date': '1939-06-30 00:00:00', 'artist': 'Dix, \nOtto', 'auction_house': 'Fischer', 'dimensions': '76 cm x 70 cm'} \n\n\uf095 Text Embedding Generation: The augmented entries were vectorised using OpenAI\u2019s text-\nembedding-3-large model. The model generates 3072-dimensional embeddings that capture \nnuanced semantic meanings.  \n\uf095 Vector Indexing with FAISS: The generated embeddings were L2-normalized and stored in a \nFAISS index using IndexFlatIP, enabling cosine similarity search via inner product. \n\uf095 Query Embedding and Retrieval: Test queries were embedded using the same model and \ncompared against the FAISS index. The most semantically similar documents are retrieved \nusing inner product similarity via FAISS IndexFlatIP. Because all embeddings were L2-\nnormalized, inner product is equivalent to cosine similarity (Singh & Singh, 2020).  \n\uf095 Prompt Construction: Retrieved documents were formatted into a structured prompt using a \ncustom builder function. The prompt included a system message that defined the LLM\u2019s role \nand provided clear instructions for summarising the retrieved content. The prompt construction \nincluded the raw context retrieved from the FAISS vector index and the original query for \nfurther reference.   \n\uf095 Generative Response: The prompt was passed to GPT-4 (gpt-4o), which generated a concise, \ncontext-aware response. The instruction included in the prompt requested a further refinement \nof the information retrieval and reranked the records based on their relevance to the retrieval \nprompt. This was designed to maximise the reliability of the final information retrieved by the \nuser. The final output was also defined in the prompt to include all relevant metadata \nreferences and URL references to the primary source materials. This strategy directly addresses \nthe concerns raised by Fuhrmeister and Hopp (2019) regarding the integration of technology \ninto Provenance Research. \nIn the following section we outline the evaluation method for assessing both the quality of the \nsemantic context retrieval and the final generative LLM output received by the end-user.  \n \n \nEvaluation  \nThis evaluation covers two aspects: (1) a comparison of the RAG pipeline with the current user \nexperience of searches using the Getty Research Portal, and (2) a detailed evaluation of RAG \nretrieval and output using a sample of 20 diverse search queries. As Yu et al. (2024) note, \nevaluating RAG pipelines is inherently complex owing to their domain-specific nature. No single \nstandard framework is universally applicable, and this challenge was clear in our study. \nConsequently, we developed a tailored evaluation framework that focused on the semantic \nrelevance of the retrieved contexts. Specifically, we analysed the top k retrievals \u2014 the 10 most \nsemantically similar results to each query \u2014 to assess how well the system supports Provenance \nResearch, which often targets one or a few specific object \nTraditional metrics such as precision, recall, or accuracy are not always suitable for Provenance \nResearch, which often targets one or a few specific objects. Where possible, retrieved contexts \n\nwere compared against a known ground truth set. However, provenance queries are frequently \nthematic or imprecise\u2014for example, searching for motifs in paintings described variably across \nauction records. In such cases, manual dataset searches were conducted, though the completeness \nof the ground truth could not be guaranteed. Notably, the model occasionally retrieved more \nrelevant records than manual efforts, highlighting the need for a flexible evaluation framework. \nTo capture the \u2018accuracy\u2019 of the information retrieval, while keeping consistent metrics across \nour evaluation, we chose the following metrics.   \n\uf095 Completeness: The percentage of known or expected records appearing in the top k retrievals \nand final summarised output.  \n\uf095 Manual Evaluation: A qualitative score (1\u20133) assessing the relevance of the final output to the \nquery:  \n\u2022 1: Irrelevant  \n\u2022 2: Partially relevant  \n\u2022 3: Highly relevant  \nThese metrics were chosen to accommodate the variability and thematic nature of provenance \nqueries, where conventional evaluation methods may fall short. In several cases, the model \nretrieved more relevant records than manual efforts, underscoring the need for a flexible \nevaluation framework: \nWe tested 20 search queries in total, spanning a range of complexity\u2014from straightforward \nobject lookups to semantically vague searches to find object records in the GPI sample data. We \ncategorised the queries into four distinct types.  \n\uf095 Specific \u2013 queries that included clear semantic indicators of object type and artist (i.e. Were \nthere any paintings by Otto Dix sold at Fischer in 1939?)  \n\uf095 Vague or Broad \u2013more general queries detailing what the targeted object(s) may look like or \npossible object features (i.e. Please retrieve any works that are not paintings and depict motifs \nVenice and are painted in Gouache)  \n\uf095 Multilingual \u2013 queries were tested in Russian and Mandarin as well as English and German \n(considered to be the main languages of the GPI) to evaluate the model\u2019s multi-lingual \ncapabilities \n\uf095 Out of Scope / Irrelevant \u2013 control questions that had no link to the data set to ensure no \nrecords were retrieved and to test inaccurate model output   \n \nTo establish a benchmark for evaluation, we replicated each query using SQL against our \ndatabase to generate a set of expected results. For specific queries, this was straightforward; \nhowever, broader, or semantically vague queries could only be approximated using keyword \nsearches. To assess the semantic retrieval quality, we compared the top k RAG results to the \nSQL-derived records. A completeness score of 100% was assigned when all expected records \nwere retrieved. If the RAG pipeline retrieved all expected records plus additional relevant ones, \n\nit was also rated 100%, reflecting its ability to surface contextually meaningful results beyond \nmanual efforts. \nThe average completeness and manual evaluation of the end GPT-output are noted below.  \nQuery Category \n \nNumber of \nQueries \n \nAverage Completeness \n(%) \n \nAverage Output \nRating \n \nMultilingual \n \n2 \n \n100 \n \n3 \n \nOut-of-Scope / \nIrrelevant \n \n3 \n \n100 \n \n2.67 \n \nSpecific \n \n8 \n \n85.2 \n \n2.88 \n \nVague or Broad \n7 \n \n64.3 \n \n2.29 \n \n \nThe summary statistics demonstrate our approach\u2019s strong potential as a tool for provenance \nsearches. Specific queries\u2014such as \u2018Were there any paintings by Otto Dix sold at Fischer in \n1939?\u2019 and \u2018Charcoal drawings by Max Liebermann that are signed\u2019 provided consistently \nrelevant record retrieval. Multilingual queries also performed well, with semantic representations \nenabling accurate retrieval across our control set of Russian and Mandarin search queries. \nNotably, the model showed an ability to interpret descriptive and material-based cues, such as \nidentifying terracotta sculptures from indirect references like \u2018Gebrannter Ton,\u2019 (fired clay) \nsuggesting promise for nuanced object-level interrogation. Out-of-scope queries were also \nhandled effectively. For instance, the query \u2018suspended sharks in tanks exhibited at the Tate\u2019 was \ncorrectly identified as irrelevant, and no records were retrieved, showing reliable domain \nboundary control. Similarly, the query for 'a sculpture depicting a balloon dog by Koons' was \nfiltered out appropriately, with GPT correctly inferring the artist\u2019s name and excluding unrelated \nresults.  \nHowever, the performance on vague or broad queries was less consistent. The query \u2018a drawing \nsold at auction attributed to an Italian artist of the 15th century\u2019 returned a painting instead of a \ndrawing, indicating a failure in media-type filtering. Another query seeking \u2018sculptures sold by \nthe authorities in Berlin\u2019 only partially matched, suggesting limitations in abstracting \ninstitutional references. While some vague queries were handled well\u2014such as the retrieval of \n\n\u2018gouache works depicting motifs of Venice\u2019\u2014the overall completeness and rating for this \ncategory were lower, highlighting the need for improved generalisation and semantic abstraction \nin both retrieval and generation stages. \nIn summary our findings overall indicated that the RAG pipeline offered a viable and flexible \nsolution for conducting provenance searches using natural language. It enables semantic retrieval \neven when specific filters are unknown and, in some cases, outperformed manual archival \nsearches by surfacing semantically relevant records not identified through SQL. While the \nperformance on ambiguous queries remains imperfect, the model shows promise for nuanced \nobject-level interrogation and cross-lingual retrieval, supporting its potential as a research tool in \nart historical contexts. \nIn the next section, we detail how our RAG approach compares to the current GPI search portal \nand how our RAG approach could complement the current standard.  \nWorkflow Comparison vs the Current GPI Search Portal \nThe Getty Provenance Index (GPI) provides an online search portal designed to facilitate the \nstructured exploration of its extensive provenance datasets. Its revamped architecture, grounded \nin CIDOC CRM and Linked Art frameworks, transforms flat-file records into a graph-based \nnetwork of linked entities, such as artworks, individuals, locations, and events. The event-centric \nmodel of CIDOC CRM allows researchers to trace meaningful relationships among people, \nobjects, and ideas by modelling events as temporally and spatially bounded contexts, rather than \nfocusing solely on static object properties (Bruseker et al., 2017). Linked. Art offers a flexible, \nweb-native data model that enables consistent, cross-collection discovery by linking cultural \nheritage records through shared entities and relationships, thereby enhancing usability and \ninteroperability across institutions (Sanderson, 2017). \nThis graph is useful for tracing intricate relationships and conducting precise metadata-driven \nsearches. Users can perform both basic keyword queries and advanced facet-based searches, \nallowing detailed filtering across resource models and branches. However, the structured nature \nof the portal requires familiarity with specific metadata terms, institutional actors, or object \nclassifications for effective use. In contrast, the RAG-based prototype introduces a flexible \nnatural language interface that supports exploratory and multilingual queries, semantic \nabstraction, and contextual summarisation. The main benefit of RAG over the current facility \noffered by Getty is the flexible and efficient natural langu1age-based search functionality of the \nRAG approach. This removes any technical barriers needed and means that searches can be \nconducted without precise knowledge of the objects\u2019 metadata.  \nWhile the RAG-based approach offers significant advantages in accessibility and semantic \nflexibility for provenance research, it also raises important ethical considerations that we address \nin the following section. \nEthical Considerations \n\nProvenance Research encompasses a wide array of historical contexts. Investigations related to \nGerman Sales data within the GPI frequently pertain to artworks looted during the Nazi era, \nparticularly those expropriated from Jewish families. To address challenging histories and \nconnections to dark episodes in both personal and national narratives, it is imperative to provide \nframeworks that are both practical and comprehensible to end users. The framework we have \ndeveloped emphasises explainable information retrieval (referencing concepts raise by Dwivedi \net al. 2017), which is structured to consistently involve a human expert in the process, commonly \nreferred to as 'human-in-the-loop' workflows. Safdar et al. (2020) identify several critical ethical \nconsiderations in the use of AI-based applications, notably highlighting the risks associated with \n'\u2019Blackbox and Bias.\u2019 Our framework addresses this issue by offering contextually pertinent \nretrieval for an LLM to utilize in its summaries, thereby reducing the risk of fabricated \nresponses. Additionally, when the context is summarized, we incorporate an evaluation step in \nthe summary that details and justifies the inclusion or exclusion of records from the raw \ncontextual retrieval. The following example is an extract from the final user output of the \nevaluation. \nInput Query: Were there any portraits of men by Rembrandt where the figure was wearing \njewellery? \nGPT Generated Output: \nThe research question is classified as object-based because it seeks information about \nspecific artworks by Rembrandt featuring men wearing jewelry. \nRelevant Objects: \n\uf095 Title :  Bildnis   eines  Polen  mit   hoher   goldgeschm\u00fcckter   Samtm\u00fctze ,  unter  der das  \ngelockte   schwarze  Haar  herausquillt . Um den Hals  zweireihige   Goldkette   mit   \nMedaillon .  \n\uf095 Artist : Rembrandt  \n\uf095 Auction House : Hahn (Heinrich)  \n\uf095 Material : Holz  \n\uf095 Dimensions : 65 cm x 46 cm  \n\uf095 Description : The portrait depicts a man wearing a richly adorned velvet cap and a double \ngold chain with a medallion around his neck.  \n\uf095 Location : Not specified  \n\uf095 Provenance Information : Not provided  \n\uf095 Public Source :  Hahn 1944 Auction Catalogue  \nExplanation of Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: \n\uf095 The item 'Bildnis eines Polen mit hoher goldgeschm\u00fcckter Samtm\u00fctze' was included \nbecause it directly matches the query's criteria: a portrait of a man by Rembrandt where \nthe figure is wearing  jewellery  (a gold chain with a medallion).  \n\n\uf095 Other items were excluded  because   of  the absence of  jewellery  in the description or \nbecause they were not by Rembrandt.  \n\uf095 The classification as object-based influenced the filtering by focusing on specific artworks \nrather than broader trends or patterns. \nRelevance Evaluation \n\uf095 Highly Relevant  \u2013  ' Bildnis   eines  Polen  mit   hoher   goldgeschm\u00fcckter   Samtm\u00fctze '  \nby Rembrandt directly answers the query with a clear description of  jewelry .  \n\uf095 Irrelevant  \u2013 'M\u00e4nnliches Bildnis' by Rembrandt does not mention  jewellery .  \n\uf095 Irrelevant  \u2013 'Brustbild eines Mannes' by Rembrandt does not mention  jewellery .  \n\uf095 Irrelevant  \u2013  ' Der Mann  mit   dem   Goldhelm '  by Rembrandt does not mention  jewelry.  \n \n[...] \nThis format ensures the results are interpretable and traceable to the original context provided by \nsemantic retrieval. This traceability allows non-specialist end users to evaluate the query results \nand determine their applicability to broader research contexts. The final output was designed to \nmaximise transparency by linking the filtered results to primary historical texts, enabling \nresearchers to integrate the efficiencies of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with targeted \narchival references and research. The framework is specifically designed to address well-\ndocumented ethical concerns associated with AI-based tools. Bostrom and Yodkowsky identified \nfour key risks in their analysis of domain-specific AI applications: bias and discrimination, lack \nof transparency, predictability and robustness, and accountability. In response to these risks, we \naddressed the ethical challenges of bias, transparency, predictability, and accountability through \nintentional design choices. By embedding enriched metadata directly into searchable text, we \nreduced the dependency on fragile keyword matching and mitigate discriminatory retrieval \nfailures. The structured prompt design and traceable outputs of the pipeline ensure transparency \nand interpretability, allowing users to comprehend not only what was retrieved but also the \nrationale behind it. Predictability is reinforced through consistent semantic retrieval and robust \nhandling of multilingual and irrelevant queries, and accountability is maintained by linking every \nresult to its original archival source and providing clear inclusion/exclusion rationales. \nOur framework empowers researchers with flexible and explainable tools, while safeguarding \nagainst the unintended consequences of opaque or biased automation. As Provenance Research \ncontinues to digitise and scale, such ethically grounded AI systems will be essential for \npreserving trust, rigor, and historical integrity. \nFurther Research \nThe current model employs a Naive RAG pipeline, utilising solely auction entry text, which is \nsupplemented with strategic metadata to enhance semantic retrieval. Several alternative \nstrategies exist to augment the model's functionality and potentially improve retrieval accuracy, \n\nparticularly for broader queries, where our evaluation identified certain deficiencies. \nAdditionally, numerous combinations and RAG implementation options are available for \nassessment, including various semantic retrieval ranking methodologies. However, these \napproaches can become highly technical, necessitating a cautionary note that transparency and \ntraceability for the end user should remain paramount in any architectural enhancement. \nFurthermore, the current prototype presents financial considerations. The architecture depends on \nproprietary models that incur costs, and scaling the RAG tool for a larger user base imposes \nsignificant expenses on the host. Consequently, exploring open-source embedding models and \ntext summary models could be beneficial for reducing future maintenance costs. Further research \ncould involve fine-tuning smaller end language models to perform the specific task of \nprovenance search summary rather than relying on larger proprietary models that incur costs per \nsearch. The framework could also be expanded to incorporate other art market datasets, such as \nthose hosted by the University of Heidelberg. Integrating digitised data from art market journals \nof the time could enhance the context provided and allow single searches to retrieve not only \nrelevant auction records from the data but also any references made to relevant artworks in \ncontemporary trade literature.  \nConclusion \nThis study introduces and evaluates a RAG prototype specifically designed for art Provenance \nResearch, utilising a 10k record sample from the Getty Provenance Index (GPI) \u2013 German Sales.  \nBy enriching raw auction entries with strategic metadata and embedding them as unified \nsemantic units, the system enables flexible natural language querying, multilingual retrieval, and \nsemantic abstraction. This approach also facilitates the integration of unstructured or \ninconsistently structured data from diverse sources into a single searchable corpus, an essential \ncapability given the heterogeneity of historical art market records. It also offers a framework that \ncould ingest other unstructured data sources into one tool, allowing researchers to query across \nformats without requiring standardised schemas or rigid metadata alignment. \nThe evaluation results indicated robust performance in specific and multilingual queries, with \nsome limitations in vague or abstract searches. These findings underscore the potential of RAG-\nbased systems to support both targeted and exploratory Provenance Research, while also \nidentifying areas for future refinement in semantic generalisation and media-type filtering. \nEthical safeguards are embedded throughout the framework, directly addressing the risks \nidentified by Bostrom and Yudkowsky in domain-specific AI applications: bias, transparency, \npredictability, and accountability. The system design ensures traceable outputs, human-in-the-\nloop workflows, and contextual grounding in primary archival sources, mitigating the risks of \nopaque or fabricated responses. \nRather than replacing existing tools such as the Getty Provenance Index portal, the RAG \nprototype complements them by offering an additional exploratory interface. It empowers \nresearchers to navigate complex historical datasets with greater efficiency while preserving the \nrigor and contextual sensitivity required in Provenance Research. As digitisation efforts expand \nand AI technologies evolve, this prototype offers a foundation for ethically grounded, scalable, \n\nand user-friendly information retrieval in the cultural heritage sector. Future iterations may \nincorporate open-source models, multimodal data, and hybrid retrieval strategies; however, the \ncore principles of explainability, transparency, and human oversight must remain central to any \nsuch development. \nReferences  \n\uf095 Agnew, W., Mckee, K.

  "pdfs/2508.19089v1.pdf": "It\u2019s All About In-Context Learning!\nTeaching Extremely Low-Resource Languages to LLMs\nYue Li, Zhixue Zhao and Carolina Scarton\nDepartment of Computer Science, University of Sheffield, UK\n{yli381,zhixue.zhao,c.scarton}@sheffield.ac.uk\nAbstract\nExtremely low-resource languages, especially\nthose written in rare scripts, as shown in Fig-\nure 1, remain largely unsupported by large lan-\nguage models (LLMs). This is due in part\nto compounding factors such as the lack of\ntraining data.\nThis paper delivers the first\ncomprehensive analysis of whether LLMs can\nacquire such languages purely via in-context\nlearning (ICL), with or without auxiliary align-\nment signals, and how these methods compare\nto parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We\nsystematically evaluate 20 under-represented\nlanguages across three state-of-the-art multi-\nlingual LLMs.\nOur findings highlight the\nlimitation of PEFT when both language and\nits script are extremely under-represented by\nthe LLM. In contrast, zero-shot ICL with lan-\nguage alignment is impressively effective on\nextremely low-resource languages, while few-\nshot ICL or PEFT is more beneficial for lan-\nguages relatively better represented by LLMs.\nFor LLM practitioners working on extremely\nlow-resource languages, we summarise guide-\nlines grounded by our results on adapting\nLLMs to low-resource languages, e.g., avoiding\nfine-tuning a multilingual model on languages\nof unseen scripts.\n1\nIntroduction\nCurrent large language models (LLMs) are typi-\ncally pre-trained with data in more than 50 lan-\nguages, offering robust support for high-resource\nlanguages, such as German and French (Le Scao\net al., 2023; Grattafiori et al., 2024; Team et al.,\n2023). However, their coverage of low-resource\nlanguages remains limited. Since these languages\nare often spoken in developing regions, insufficient\nLLM support risks reinforcing socio-economic dis-\nparities and further isolating affected communi-\nties (Shen et al., 2024; Jadhav et al., 2024).\n1https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/\nlanguages\nFigure 1: Regional distribution of the languages stud-\nied in this paper. Red denotes the five languages with\nrare scripts, and blue represents the other 15 languages.\nY (yes) and N (no) denote whether it\u2019s supported by\nGoogle Translate1. Accuracy represents performance\non topic classification (SIB-200) with DeepSeek (7b) in\nzero-shot ICL (majority voting = 0.25, English = 0.83).\nExtending LLMs to support extremely low-\nresource languages via continued pre-training\n(Yong et al., 2023a) is possible but often imprac-\ntical, due to the need for large-scale monolingual\ncorpora and substantial computational resources\n(Joshi et al., 2020). Although LLM support can\nbe achieved for downstream tasks via resource-\nefficient training, such as parameter-efficient fine-\ntuning (PEFT), it still requires a non-trivial amount\nof labeled data. Therefore, with recent advances in\nin-context learning (ICL), we ask whether LLMs\ncan learn new languages purely through ICL\n(Yong et al., 2023b; Zhang et al., 2024; Cahyaw-\nijaya et al., 2024). Specifically: (1) Is ICL alone\nsufficient to enable LLMs learn extremely low-\nresource or entirely unseen languages? (2) Can\nauxiliary signals in the prompt be useful enabling\nor improving ICL? (3) ICL or PEFT, which one is\na better choice for learning a new language?\nIn this study, we consider 20 low-resource lan-\nguages, including five extremely low-resource ones\narXiv:2508.19089v1  [cs.CL]  26 Aug 2025\n\nLanguage Script Translator | Accuracy\nDzongkha (dzo) | 2asragxa% ajar (Tibetan) Y 0.128\nSantali (sat) GACoHZVBL (Ol Chiki) N 0.172\nNko (nqo) 0 TS ScfTHIA (NKo) N 0.137\nTamasheq (taq) IOote (Tifinagh) N 0.118\nTigrinya (tir) 9\u00b0%-b 71 1 (Ge'ez) Y 0.186\n\n\nMethod\nData\nTraining\nAnnotator\nEN\nTarget\nOther\nZero-shot ICL\nbaseline\n\u2717\n\u2717\n\u2717\n\u2717\n\u2717\nsentence-level alignment\n\u2713(k)\n\u2713(k)\n\u2717\n\u2717\ntranslate\nword-level alignment\n\u2717\n\u2717\ndict.\n\u2717\n\u2717\nword-level translation\n\u2717\n\u2717\ndict.\n\u2717\n\u2717\nFew-shot ICL\ndemonstration in target language\n\u2717\n\u2713(k)\n\u2717\n\u2717\nlabel\ndemonstration with alignment\n\u2713(k)\n\u2713(k)\n\u2717\n\u2717\nlabel+translate\nParameter efficient fine-tuning\n\u2717\n\u2713(N)\n\u2717\n\u2713\nlabel\nTable 1: List of methods used in this paper and resources they may rely on: (1) Data: in-domain data in English (EN)\nor target language (Target), or a dictionary (dict.) for word translation; k denotes k-shot examples, and N denotes\nthe full training data (k \u226aN); (2) Training: whether model parameters are updated; (3) Annotator: whether native\nspeakers are needed to label the data, or translate data to English to enable alignment.\n(Figure 1) and 15 written in Latin, Arabic, or Cyril-\nlic scripts (referred to as target languages2). ICL\nwith auxiliary signals (i.e., class category, language\nalignment) is explored. Our setup (Table 1) in-\ncludes few-shot ICL, sentence-level alignment of\nunlabelled or labelled examples in zero-shot or few-\nshot ICL, and word-level alignment for the target\nlanguage in zero-shot ICL.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to sys-\ntematically analyse whether ICL can enable LLMs\nto learn extremely low-resource languages. Our\nmain findings are:\n\u2022 In contrast to prior work (Razumovskaia et al.,\n2024), small-scaled fine-tuning is generally inef-\nfective when a language and its script are highly\nunder-represented or entirely absent from both\nthe tokenizer and pre-training data (e.g., sat, nqo\nand taq on DeepSeek).\n\u2022 In such cases, zero-shot ICL with language align-\nment yields substantial gains, potentially surpass-\ning vocabulary extension on multilingual pre-\ntrained language models (PLMs) through con-\ntinue pre-training.\n\u2022 Zero-shot ICL with language alignment is es-\npecially effective for languages with minimal\nLLM support, often exceeding few-shot ICL and\nperforming comparably to, or better than, fine-\ntuning.\n\u2022 Few-shot ICL and especially PEFT perform best\nfor low-resource languages for which LLMs ex-\nhibit a certain level of support.\n2\nRelated Work\nLanguage Adaptation in Pretraining\nContin-\nued pretraining LLMs on a monolingual corpus\n2represented by language code ISO 639-3 (in Table 2)\nin a target language is a common strategy to ex-\ntend support to languages not (well) represented in\nthe original pretraining data, also enhancing ICL\nperformance in the target language (Yong et al.,\n2023a). Various methods have been explored for\ntraining efficiency (Zhang et al., 2021; Yong et al.,\n2023a; Cui et al., 2023), vocabulary and tokeniser\nadaptation (Yamaguchi et al., 2024a; Balachandran,\n2023; Cui et al., 2023; Larcher et al., 2023) and data\nefficiency (Yamaguchi et al., 2024b; Shaham et al.,\n2024; Kurz et al., 2024). However, the effective-\nness of these pretraining-based methods often de-\npends on the availability of large-scale training data,\nan assumption that does not hold for extremely low-\nresource languages in real-world scenarios.\nAdapting LLMs to Low-Resource Languages\nfor Downstream Tasks\nICL with different strate-\ngies has been explored to improve LLMs\u2019 adap-\ntation to low-resource languages, including tech-\nniques such as code-switching (Yong et al., 2023b;\nSchlicht et al., 2025), demonstration example se-\nlection (Winata et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2024;\nTanwar et al., 2023), prompt format optimization\n(Zhang et al., 2023; Cahyawijaya et al., 2024),\nmachine translation (Bandarkar et al., 2024), and\ndictionary-based prompting (Lu et al., 2024; Zhang\net al., 2024). Another promising direction is PEFT,\nwhich has demonstrated superior performance with\ncomputational costs comparable to few-shot ICL\n(Liu et al., 2022). However, most existing studies\nfocus on languages that are: (1) relatively high-\nresource (e.g., German); (2) low-resource but writ-\nten in widely supported scripts (e.g., Zhuang in\nLatin script (Zhang et al., 2024)); and (3) writ-\nten in rare scripts but already included in model\npre-training (Razumovskaia et al., 2024). Con-\nsequently, how to effectively adapt LLMs to ex-\ntremely low-resource languages such as nqo (Fig-\n\nure 1) is still unclear.\n3\nLearning Extremely Low-Resource\nLanguages\nTable 1 summarises the experimented approaches\nand assumed available data resources. Standard\ncross-lingual transfer that aims to improve and then\ntransfer task knowledge from English is not consid-\nered in this study (i.e, fine-tuning with English data\nor few-shot ICL with English examples), as the\nLLMs have already demonstrated high accuracy on\nEnglish in zero-shot ICL (Table 4)3.\nBaseline\nThe vanilla zero-shot ICL when the\nLLMs are prompted only with task description and\nthe target language input tgt. We use English task\ndescription as it has been widely adopted showing\nimprovements in ICL performance (Zhang et al.,\n2023; Razumovskaia et al., 2024). The prompt\nformat is: [<task description> + <inputtgt>].\nZero-Shot ICL with alignment\nwe experiment\nwith adding word- or sentence-level alignment be-\ntween English and a target language in the prompt,\nwithout providing labelled examples.\n\u2022 Word-level alignment: We provide a translation\nfor each word in the target-language input using\na dictionary, inspired by prior work on machine\ntranslation (Zhang et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024).\nThe prompt format for an inputtgt with N words\n{wtgt\n1 , wtgt\n2 , ..., wtgt\nN } is: [<task description> +\n<inputtgt> + <wtgt\n1\nmeans weng\n1\nin English; ...;\nwtgt\nN means weng\nN\nin English>]. We use the NLLB\ntranslator4 (Costa-Juss\u00e0 et al., 2022) to create the\ndictionaries following Lu et al. (2024). For lan-\nguages not supported by NLLB (nqo, sat5, and\nmin), we train the word alignment tool fast_align\n(Dyer et al., 2013) to simulate a high-quality dic-\ntionary (See Appendix B).\n\u2022 Word-level translation: We directly concatenate\nthe English word translations in their orders in\ntarget languages as the \u201cEnglish\u201d translation (i.e.,\ninputeng\u2032 = concat (weng\n1\n, ..., weng\nN )), and prompt\nLLMs with: [<task description> + inputeng\u2032].\n3Machine translating target-languages into English is not\nconsidered, since our aim is to teach low-resource languages to\nLLMs. Reliable machine translators are also not available for\n3 out of 5 rare-script languages. In practice, developing a high-\nquality machine translator is significantly more expensive than\ncreating the data resources we consider here.\n4https://huggingface.co/facebook/nllb-200-3.\n3B\n5NLLB repeats the same word without stopping\n\u2022 Sentence-level alignment: Assuming there is a\nlimited k number of parallel in-domain unla-\nbelled sentences in English {seng\n1\n,...,seng\nk\n} and\ntarget language {stgt\n1 ,...,stgt\nk }. The prompt for-\nmat is: [<target language: stgt\n1 ; English: seng\n1\n;\n...; target language: stgt\nk ; English: seng\nk\n> + <task\ndescription> + <inputtgt>]. We select the target-\nlanguage example sentences from the training\ndata through random sampling or BM25 (Robert-\nson et al., 2009).\nFew-Shot ICL\nAssuming there is a limited num-\nber of labelled in-domain data samples in the target\nlanguage or English, demonstration examples from\nthe training data are retrieved by BM25, inspired\nby Zhang et al. (2024).\n\u2022 Demonstration in target language: We prompt\nLLMs with k-shot demonstration examples in\nthe target language Dtgt\n1 , ..., Dtgt\nk . The prompt\nformat is [<task description> + <Dtgt\n1 , ..., Dtgt\nk >\n+ <inputtgt>].\n\u2022 Demonstration with alignment:\nLLMs are\nprompted with parallel demonstration examples\nin both English and target languages: [<task de-\nscription> + <Dtgt\n1\nmeans Deng\n1\n, ..., Dtgt\nk\nmeans\nDeng\nk\n> + <inputtgt>].\nPEFT\nWe preliminarily experiment with com-\npetitive methods such as LoRA (Hu et al., 2022),\nDoRA (Liu et al., 2024) and IA3 (Liu et al., 2022).\nSame as Yong et al. (2023a), we found that IA3 is\nthe most effective and efficient approach. There-\nfore, due to computational constraints, we only ex-\nperiment with IA3 as a representative of the PEFT\nmethods. We also discuss the comparison with\nfully fine-tuned multilingual PLMs in Section 4.4.\n3.1\nExperimental Setups\nTarget Languages\nWe mainly ground our re-\nsearch on the SIB-200 seven-way topic classifica-\ntion dataset (Adelani et al., 2024), as it offers par-\nallel training and evaluation data with the broadest\nmultilingual coverage in natural language under-\nstanding (NLU) tasks. We also analyse the general-\nisability of our findings on reading comprehension\n(i.e., BELEBELE (Bandarkar et al., 2024)), which\nis a more challenging task than topic classification.\nSince most prevalent LLMs do not disclose com-\nprehensive lists of languages present in their pre-\ntraining data, we select the low-resource languages\n\nfor which LLMs exhibit significantly limited capa-\nbility. We measure the LLMs\u2019 capability on each\nlanguage with Information Parity (IP) (Tsvetkov\nand Kipnis, 2024) on the SIB training data. Given\na text in the target language and its English transla-\ntion, IP is defined as the ratio between the negative\nlog-likelihood of the target-language text and that\nof its English counterpart under the same model.\nA very low IP score indicates that the LLM strug-\ngles to represent information in the target language,\nlikely due to limited or no exposure during pretrain-\ning. Based on this criterion, we select the languages\nwith the average lowest IP scores across the LLMs\nwe study on. This includes five languages writ-\nten in relatively rare and distinct scripts (Figure\n1) plus 15 languages using more commonly sup-\nported scripts (i.e., seven in Latin, four in Arabic,\nand four in Cyrillic). For the latter, we select lan-\nguages that do not have the same linguistic roots\nas English (Latin script), Modern Standard Arabic\n(Arabic script) and Russian (Cyrillic script), which\nare commonly represented in LLMs\u2019 training data.\nThe full list of the languages is shown in Table 2.\nModels\nWe experiment with three recent open-\nsource instruction-tuned LLMs with multilingual\nability: DeepSeek6, LlaMA-3.27 and Gemma-28.\nDue to computational constraints, their medium-\nsized variants are considered.\nSetups\nWe adopt accuracy as the evaluation met-\nric following Adelani et al. (2024). We use greedy\nsearch in decoding for the purpose of reproducibil-\nity. The prompt template for baseline zero-shot ICL\nis also used in PEFT for a fair comparison. SIB-\n200 dataset\u2019s official train/dev/test set split is used.\nThe examples included in zero-shot and few-shot\nICL are retrieved from the training data. As pre-\nprocessing for BM25, only white-space splitting is\napplied. The hyper-parameter tuning and training\ndetails for IA3 are included in Appendix B.\n4\nResults\n4.1\nLimitation of Fine-Tuning\nFine-tuning Improvement Disparity\nFigure 2\nillustrates the performance improvement after fine-\ntuning with the training data in the target language.\n6https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/\ndeepseek-llm-7b-chat\n7https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.\n2-3B-Instruct\n8https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-2-2b-it\nIn most cases, fine-tuning leads to enhanced perfor-\nmance, although the degree of improvement varies\nnotably. For low-resource languages using com-\nmon scripts, accuracy scores can rise to more than\n0.6 on average, resulting in an acceptable perfor-\nmance (full results in Table 4). In contrast, results\non the five languages written in rare scripts are in-\nconsistent. For instance, while DeepSeek performs\nworse than majority voting on all of these five lan-\nguages in the baseline zero-shot ICL setting, PEFT\nraises the accuracy scores of dzo and tir to above\n0.45. In contrast, gains for the remaining three\nlanguages are rather modest, particularly for sat,\nwhich still stays slightly below majority voting. We\nobserve that this discrepancy is due to overfitting,\nwhich appears to occur at a very early stage in the\nfine-tuning for languages showing limited improve-\nment.\nRisk of Overfitting and Impact Factors\nTo gain\nmore insights on why certain languages suffer more\nsevere overfitting, we analyse:\n\u2022 Tokenization efficiency: Most LLMs\u2019 tokenis-\ners, including those used by the three models\nin our study, adopt byte-level Byte Pair Encod-\ning (BPE) (Wang et al., 2020) or SentencePiece\n(Kudo and Richardson, 2018). When encounter-\ning texts in rare scripts not seen during tokeniser\ntraining, characters are often segmented into raw\nbytes, resulting in a vocabulary with drastically\nreduced effectiveness. For instance, BPE tokenis-\ners based on UTF-8 encoding may end up repre-\nsenting an entire rare-script language using only\n256 raw-byte token values (Wang et al., 2020),\nlimiting the model\u2019s ability to learn generalisable\nlinguistic patterns with small training data (Zhao\nand Aletras, 2024). Tokenisation efficiency for\na given text i is measured using Token-to-Byte\nRatio (TBR) =\nnumi\ntokens\nnumi\nbytes , where numi\nbytes is the\nnumber of bytes required to represent the text\nwith the same encoding system used in the to-\nkeniser, and numi\ntokens is the number of tokens\nproduced by the LLM\u2019s tokeniser. A TBR score\nclose to 1 indicates that the tokeniser is operating\nnearly at the raw byte level, signalling extremely\npoor tokenisation. For example, the average TBR\nfor sat\u2019s training data with DeepSeek\u2019s tokeniser\nis 0.99, suggesting that nearly every character is\nsegmented into raw bytes and that DeepSeek sig-\nnificantly lacks meaningful representations for\nsat.\n\n(a) DeepSeek\n(b) LLaMA-3.2\n(c) Gemma-2\nFigure 2: Accuracy improvement from baseline zero-shot ICL (denoted as \u00d7) to PEFT (denoted as \u2022).

The performances\nof English (eng) and the majority voting baseline (vertical dashed line, accuracy = 0.25) are for reference.\n(a) DeepSeek\n(b) LLaMA-3.2\n(c) Gemma-2\nFigure 3: Correlation between information parity (IP), token-to-byte ratio (TBR) and accuracy score after fine-tuning.\nFor improved visualisation, the x-axis represents (1\u2212TBR). The language bubbles close to the left corner denote\nlanguages that are under-represented by both tokeniser and model. Bubbles with darker colour denote lower\nperformance after fine-tuning. Names of the languages with PEFT performances lower than 0.4 are marked in red.\n\u2022 Multilingual capability: Fine-tuning is usually\nmore effective when the LLM has already ac-\nquired some linguistic competence in the target\nlanguage during pre-training. IP is used again to\nestimate the LLMs\u2019 capabilities for each target\nlanguage prior to fine-tuning. As discussed in\nSection 3.1, the higher the IP value the more effi-\nciently the LLM represents information provided\nin the target language. Conversely, a low IP score\nsuggests under-representation of a language.\nFigure 3 shows the average TBR and IP scores\nfor each target language in the training data, also\npresenting their correlations with fine-tuning per-\nformance. Languages with high TBR and low IP\nscores are the ones where fine-tuning tends to en-\ncounter more severely overfitting, resulting in very\nlimited generalisation. This suggests that small-\nscaled fine-tuning on downstream tasks is unlikely\nto be beneficial when a language and its script are\nhighly under-represented or even unseen in both to-\nkeniser training and model pre-training. This find-\ning also highlights the importance of improving rep-\nresentation of low-resource languages and scripts\nduring pre-training. Even modest improvements\nin representation, either at tokeniser or model pre-\ntraining level, can lead to notably more effective\nfind-tuning adaptation.\nFor instance, although\ntir, sat, and nqo are nearly entirely tokenised as\nraw bytes by DeepSeek\u2019s tokeniser (TBR > 0.99),\nDeepSeek exhibits stronger pre-trained capabilities\non tir (higher IP) compared to sat and nqo, trans-\nlating into more substantial gains from fine-tuning.\nSimilarly, while LLaMA-3.2 shows comparable\nIP scores for both dzo and tir, dzo benefits from\nbetter tokenisation (lower TBR, i.e. higher 1 \u2212\nTBR), potentially leading to larger performance\nimprovement after fine-tuning.\n4.2\nAlignment in Zero-Shot ICL\n4.2.1\nSentence-Level Alignment\nEffectiveness of Semantic Similar Examples\nFigure 4 shows DeepSeek\u2019s performance when\nprompted with one unlabeled example in the target\nlanguage alongside its English translation. Similar\ntrends are observed for LLaMA-3.2 and Gemma-2,\nwith detailed results in the Appendix C. Although\nthe topic label of the example is not included in the\nprompt, incorporating semantically similar texts\nin both target language and English significantly\nenhances performance for low-resource languages\nwith low baseline zero-shot ICL performances, es-\npecially those using rarer scripts. However, this\nbenefit diminishes as the baseline zero-shot ICL\nperformance improves.

Red denotes baseline zero-shot ICL.\nshow an average improvement exceeding 0.22, with\na peak gain of 0.36 for sat on LLaMA-3.2. In con-\ntrast, for languages with baseline scores above 0.3,\nthe average improvement falls below 0.07. In some\ncases, LLaMA-3.2 and Gemma-2 exhibit minor per-\nformance declines, with the largest drops being 0.1\nfor kaz on both LLaMA-3.2 and Gemma-2 (base-\nline = 0.59 and 0.61 respectively). Furthermore,\nthe models\u2019 performance often degrade when ex-\namples are randomly sampled from the training set,\nhighlighting that the effectiveness of the alignment\nhinges on the semantic similarity between the input\ntext and the example in target language. More-\nover, improving semantic search for low-resource\nlanguages or even enhancing text pre-processing\napproaches (e.g., lemmatisation and stemming),\nbeyond the simple whitespace-based tokenisation\nused here, has the potential to increase performance\nin this sentence-alignment setting.\nImpact of the Number of Examples\nWe further\nanalyse the performance when varying the num-\nber of unlabelled parallel examples provided in the\nprompt, from two to five examples. We find that in-\ncreasing the number of randomly sampled parallel\nexamples in the prompt could slightly improve the\nperformance, although the gap between BM25 sam-\npled examples is still notable. However, providing\nmore semantic related examples does not consis-\ntently improve performance across all languages.\nWe hypothesize that it may be influenced by the\nrelative length of the target-language sequences\ncompared to English. To test this, we compute the\naverage tokenizer parity (TP) scores (Petrov et al.,\n2023) for each language in the training set (in Table\n2). Given a text in its target language and English\ntranslation, TP is defined as the ratio of the number\nof tokens in English to the number of tokens in\nthe target language. A lower TP score indicates\nthat the target language is tokenized into relatively\nlonger sequences compared to English. We define\na binary variable indicating whether adding more\nexamples is beneficial: it is set to true if at least\n3 out of the 4 multi-shot settings (2, 3, 4, and 5\nexamples) outperform the 1-shot setting. We then\ncalculate the point-biserial correlation coefficient\n(Lev, 1949) between the TP score and this binary in-\ndicator. The results show a statistically significant\ncorrelation, suggesting that languages with lower\nTP scores are less likely to benefit from additional\nparallel unlabelled examples.\n4.2.2\nWord-Level Alignment\n(a) chrf++ \u22640.5\n(b) chrf++ > 0.5\nFigure 5: Accuracy scores for LLaMA-3.2 over low-\nresource languages in zero-shot ICL with word-level\nalignment (gray) or word-level translation (orange) set-\ntings. Red denotes baseline zero-shot ICL.\nThe zero-shot ICL performance with word-level\nalignment or translation on LLaMA-3.2 is shown\nin Figure 5. The reported chrf++ score9 of each lan-\nguage on NLLB is used as an indicator of the qual-\nity of the dictionary. For DeepSeek and Gemma-2\n(full results in Appendix C), adopting word-level\nalignment or translation always improve the per-\nformance over the baseline. However, LLaMA-\n3.2\u2019s performance is highly influenced by the dic-\ntionary\u2019s quality. When the chrf++ score is lower\nthan 0.5 (Figure 5a), including the low-quality\nword-level alignment (gray lines) can harm the per-\nformance (e.g., fuv, kac, wol, and azb). In con-\ntrast, when chrf++ score is higher than 0.5 (Figure\n5b), word-level alignment is always beneficial. For\nnqo, sat, and min, we train fast_align on the SIB-\n9https://tinyurl.com/nllb200dense3bmetrics\n\nazb\n\ntat\n\n\n\n\nNus\n\n\n200 dataset to simulate a high-quality dictionary\n(see Section 3). LLMs\u2019 performance for these lan-\nguages is always improved with word-level align-\nment (around 0.6 of accuracy improvement), high-\nlighting the importance of the dictionary quality.\nICL with word-level translation significantly re-\nduces the inference time than using word-level\nalignment by reducing input length.. However, its\nperformance exhibits variable superiority across\nlanguages and LLMs. Specifically, it is consistently\nbetter than world-level alignment on LLaMA-3.2,\nwhile it is always worse than world-level or even\nbaseline on DeepSeek and Gemma-2.\n4.3\nAlignment in Few-Shot ICL\nFor languages with baseline accuracy lower than\nmajority voting, including English translations in\nfew-shot ICL often improves results across all the\nLLMs, when using more than one demonstration\nexample. However, in 1-shot ICL, removing the En-\nglish translation tends to yield better performance\non DeepSeek and LLaMA-3.2, while Gemma-2\ncontinues to benefit from them. For languages with\nstrong zero-shot ICL performance, both DeepSeek\nand Gemma-2 benefit from the alignment, whereas\nLLaMA-3.2 performs best without them. Over-\nall, unlike the consistent trends across LLMs in\nzero-shot ICL with alignment, we observe more\nvariations how LLMs respond to aligned prompts\nin few-shot scenarios (full results in Appendix C).\nAlthough not examined by prior work (Cahyaw-\nijaya et al., 2024), we find that model perfor-\nmance can be highly sensitive to the order of\nthe task description and demonstration examples\nin the prompt, for certain languages, especially\non DeepSeek.\nFor example, when prompting\nDeepseek with 1-shot labelled nqo example with\nEnglish translation, the accuracy jumps from 0.30\nto 0.42 if the task description is moved to af-\nter the demonstration example. In most of the\ncases, prompting with demonstrations at the be-\nginning lead to better performance for DeepSeek\nand Gemma-2, while LLaMA-3.2 slightly prefers\ntask description at the beginning. Results presented\nfor few-shot ICL are based on the optimal task de-\nscription position selected on the validation set.\n(a) extremely low (b) low (acc<0.45) (c) low (acc>0.45)\nFigure 6: Accuracy comparison among baseline (red),\nPEFT (green), best zero-shot ICL (blue) and best few-\nshot ICL (black) on LLaMA-3.2. Languages are cate-\ngorised into: (a) Both language and script are severely\nunder-represented (names in red in Figure 3b, base-\nline accuracy < 0.2): zero-shot > few-shot > PEFT;\n(b) Better represented, but baseline < 0.45: PEFT >\nzero-shot \u2265few-shot; (c) Baseline > 0.45: PEFT >\nfew-shot > zero-shot.\n4.4\nComparison across PEFT, Zero- and\nFew-Shot ICL\nBased on our analysis, zero-shot ICL with word-10\nor sentence-level alignment and few-shot ICL with\nor without alignment can all achieve promising\nimprovement over the baseline across languages\nand LLMs. Next, we discuss which approach is\nmore effective from different aspects. We present\nthe results in Figure 6 for LLaMA-3.2. DeepSeek\nand Gemma-2 show same trend (see Appendix C).\nFine-Tuning vs. ICL\nWhen the low-resource\nlanguage is extremely under-represented in both to-\nkeniser and model (Figure 6a), fine-tuning LLMs or\neven PLMs11 yields minimal improvement, while\nzero-shot ICL with either sentence- or word-level\nalignment offers significant improvements (Fig-\nure 2a vs. 4a). Adelani et al. (2024) extended\nthe vocabulary of XLM-R for nqo with continue-\npretraining, leading to fine-tuning accuracy on SIB-\n200 test set rising 0.17 points. However, it is still\nlower than the performances of LLMs in zero-shot\nICL with alignment, which are above 0.41.\nFor the remaining low-resource languages (Fig-\nure 6b and 6c), fine-tuning normally has better\nperformance than ICL. Overall, the average differ-\nence between PEFT and the best ICL approach on\nDeepSeek, LLaMA-3.2 and Gemma-2 is 0.13, 0.13,\nand 0.08, respectively.\nZero-Shot vs. Few-Shot\nWe observe that for\nlanguages with low baseline zero-shot ICL per-\n10Results based on fast_align are excluded, as it potentially\nleaks gold standard English translations into the prompt.\n11Based on results for XLM-R (large) from Adelani et al.\n(2024), see Table 4.\n\nSat\n\ntaq\n\n\n\nformance (i.e., accuracy < 0.45 on all LLMs), in\nmost cases (at least more than 50%), zero-shot ICL\nwith word/sentence-level alignment leads to better\nperformance than few-shot ICL regardless if the\nalignment is provided or not (Figure 6b, comparing\nblack and blue lines). When baseline performance\nis higher than 0.45 (Figure 6c), few-shot ICL al-\nways provides best results. In our study, these\nlanguages are khk, tgk, azb, eus, tat, kaz, and\nurd, consistent across all the LLMs. Overall, if\nthe LLM significantly lacks capability on the target\nlanguage, providing label in ICL might be useless.\n5\nDiscussion\n5.1\nNLU Tasks beyond Topic Classification\nWe test our findings on BELEBELE, a reading com-\nprehension parallel multilingual dataset, covering\n11 out of the 20 languages studied here. It con-\ntains questions with four multiple-choice answers\nlinked to a passage. tir is available among the five\nlanguages with rare scripts. We split the data into\ntraining, validation and test, following SIB-200, to\nenable a consistent comparison (See Appendix C).\nWe conduct experiments only on LLaMA-3.2, due\nto its long context length and computational con-\nstraints. We retrieve the passage from the training\ndata with BM25 as example and provide its En-\nglish translation as passage alignment. We adopt\naccuracy for evaluation (Bandarkar et al., 2024).\nMost results align with our observations on SIB-\n200 dataset. Specifically, PEFT still shows no im-\nprovement for tir, while being more effective for\nother languages. Zero-shot ICL with passage align-\nment could still improve over the baseline zero-shot\nICL in most cases, especially for the languages\nwith lower baseline performance (e.g., accuracy <\n0.35). However, as the task is more challenging, the\nlevel of improvement is not as notable as on topic\nclassification. The model also potentially requires\nmore unlabelled parallel data for consistent im-\nprovements across all languages. Similar to topic\nclassification, in most cases, zero-shot ICL with\npassage alignment surpasses few-shot ICL when\nbaseline performance is lower than 0.5.\nConversely, word-level alignment is not effec-\ntive on reading comprehension, which may be ex-\nplained by the quality of the dictionary created. Un-\nlike topic classification, whose prediction can be\nmade based on one or two topic-related words, read-\ning comprehension relies less on such cue words,\nrequiring a higher quality of word translations.\n5.2\nSuggestions to Practitioners\nIn practice, performance is not the only consid-\neration. Investment in data and computational re-\nsources needs to be carefully considered, especially\nfor low-resource languages. Aiming to adapt an\nLLM to a low-resource language for a downstream\ntask, which approach should be prioritized, and\nwhat types of data should be created?\nFor low-resource languages that are extremely\nunder-represented in both tokeniser and model\n(e.g., nqo) fine-tuning is not effective and zero-\nshot ICL with alignment shows promising improve-\nments. We suggest prioritizing investment in hu-\nman translation to create a small-scale in-domain\nparallel data for zero-shot ICL with alignment.\nFor low-resource languages where LLMs\ndemonstrate limited capability\nfew-shot ICL\nmight lead to better performance than zero-shot\nICL with alignment.\nHowever, in most cases,\nthese gains are modest and may even come at the\nrisk of performance degradation. With fine-tuning\nLLM/PLM being effective and with acceptable\nzero-shot ICL performance for these languages,\ndecisions should be made by comparing the finan-\ncial costs between human translation (for zero-shot\nICL) and human annotation (for fine-tuning).\nFor low-resource languages where LLMs\ndemonstrate a certain level of capability\nfew-\nshot leads to better performance than zero-shot ICL\nwith alignment. Human annotation tends to be\nrequired for a notable improvement for these lan-\nguages. Practitioners should consider the trade-off\nbetween the amount of data to annotate (effective\nfine-tuning may require more data than few-shot\nICL) and the computational costs (LLM inference\nis more expensive than fine-tuning PLMs).\n6\nConclusion\nThis work provides a systematic analysis on\nwhether ICL can enable LLMs to effectively sup-\nport extremely low-resource languages on down-\nstream tasks. As some of the key findings that\ncontrast to prior work, we reveal the limitation of\nfine-tuning when languages and their scripts are\nboth highly under-represented. In such cases, zero-\nshot ICL augmented with word- or sentence-level\nalignment yields promising results. Meanwhile,\nfew-shot ICL or PEFT tends to perform better for\nlanguages relatively better represented during pre-\ntraining. Our study highlights the importance of\n\nlanguage and script coverage in LLMs, and the\nstrong potential of ICL for language adaptation.\nLimitations\nAlthough we conducted more than 450 experi-\nments, our study did not include other popular\nLLMs, such as Mistral and Qwen. Due to our\ncomputational constraints and consideration of fair\ncomparison with PEFT on same LLM size, we did\nnot experiment with LLMs with large sizes, such as\nGemma-2 (9b) 12 or LLaMA-3.3 (70b) 13. Future\nwork could explore whether a larger LLM could\nenable even more improvement in ICL with word-\nor sentence level language alignment.\nDue to very limited datasets with parallel data\navailable for these extremely low-resource lan-\nguages, we covered topic classification and reading\ncomprehension in this study. On reading compre-\nhension, we were only able to experiment with\n11 of the 20 target languages. Both SIB-200 and\nBELEBELE are constructed based on Flores-200\ndataset (Costa-Juss\u00e0 et al., 2022). With the increase\nof language coverage for NLP tasks in the future,\nour findings could be tested on other tasks (e.g.,\ncommon-sense reasoning or summarization.) and\nother domains (e.g., medical, social media).\nAs a lack of native speakers and reliable gold-\nstandard word translations, we were not able to\naccurately access the quality of the dictionary that\nwe created using NLLB translator or fastalign. Our\nstudy does not show promising results when using\nthe created dictionary to assist reading comprehen-\nsion in ICL. However, as discussed in the main\ncontent, the results might be improved with a better\ndictionary. But the effectiveness on SIB-200 and\nineffectiveness on BELEBELE imply that for chal-\nlenging tasks with long input length, word transla-\ntion quality is more important than for tasks with\nshorter input. Also, we directly translate words into\nEnglish to simulate a dictionary following prior\nwork. However, in practice, using a real-world\ndictionary raises additional challenges such as han-\ndling lexical ambiguity and polysemy, which may\nalso impact the performance of word-level align-\nment in zero-shot ICL.\nAs very limited parallel corpus available for our\ntarget languages, we did not systematically analyse\nhow the ICL performance would be impacted if the\n12https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-2-9b\n13https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.\n3-70B-Instruct\nincluded unlabelled parallel text is out-of-domain\n(e.g., from another dataset). However, since ran-\ndomly sampled examples from the training data\nalready poses risk of performance degradation, we\nhypothesise that zero-shot sentence-level alignment\nwith out-of-domain examples might demonstrate\nlimited benefit.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work is supported by the UK\u2019s innovation\nagency (InnovateUK) grant number 10039039 (ap-\nproved under the Horizon Europe Programme\nas VIGILANT, EU grant agreement number\n101073921) (https://www.vigilantproject.eu).\nReferences\nDavid Ifeoluwa Adelani, Hannah Liu, Xiaoyu Shen,\nNikita Vassilyev, Jesujoba O.

Language code represents language (ISO 639-3)_script (ISO 15924).\nB\nImplementation Details\nPrompt\nFor BELEBELE, we adopt the same\nprompt used by the authors for baseline zero-\nshot ICL14. As for SIB-200, we use the follow-\ning prompt for baseline zero-shot ICL: \"What is\nthe topic discussed in the following {language\nname} text?\nThere are seven options:\n\"sci-\nence/technology\", \"travel\", \"politics\", \"sports\",\n\"health\", \"entertainment\", and \"geography\". Now\ncomplete the following example without explana-\ntions. Text: {text}. Topic option is:\", as we found\nit performing better on the validation set than the\none used by the original authors of SIB-200. Ad-\nditionally, we observed that explicitly indicating\nthe language of the input text had no impact on per-\nformance. For extremely low-resource languages\nsuch as Nko and Santali, LLaMA-3.2 and Gemma-\n2 refuse to perform the task if prompted with\n\"....complete the following example\", stating that\nthey do not recognize the input language, no matter\nwhether the name of the language is explicitly given\nin the prompt or not. However, they would pro-\nduce a prediction when prompted with \"complete\nthe following example without explanations\". For\nsentence-level alignment, the LLMs are instructed\nas \"Use the following pairs of {language name}\ntexts and their English translations to help you un-\nderstand {language name}.{alignment example}.\nNow based on your understanding, answer the\nquestion below without explanation.\". For word-\n14https://github.com/facebookresearch/belebele/\nblob/main/sample_zero_shot_instructions.md\nlevel alignment, we instruct LLMs with \"Please\nuse the provided English translation of each word\nto help you understand the {language name} text.\".\nExperiments are conduct on NVIDIA A100-PCIE-\n40GB.\nDictionary\nFor each data sample in the test set,\nwe extract words in target language based on white-\nspace splitting only. Then we use NLLB-200 trans-\nlator (3.3B)15 to translate each word into English.\nFor the three languages that are not supported by\nNLLB, we train the word alignment tool fast_align\n(Dyer et al., 2013) with SIB-200 training data and\nthen align the English words and target-language\nwords in the test set. We use the default training\nand alignment settings in fast_align16.\nIA3\nThe rescale vectors are learnt for key, value\nof the attention modules and feed-forward network\nin each layer. We use batch size as 4, and early stop-\nping strategy based on validation loss, with max\ntraining epochs as 10. We use AdamW (Loshchilov\nand Hutter, 2019) for optimization. We perform\nhyper-parameter search on learning rate of {1e-3,\n5e-3, 8e-3, 1e-2}. The optimal learning rate on\nvalidation set is 8e-3. For extremely low-resource\nlanguages where IA3 show limited improvement,\nwe also search learning rate from {1e-4, 3e-3, 7e-\n3}. We run experiments 3 times and report the\naverage performance.

Med-\nical doctors guide these conversations through targeted questioning\nto efficiently gather the information required to provide the best pos-\nsible outcomes for patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst work that studies physician intent trajectories in doctor-patient\ndialogues. We use the \u2018Ambient Clinical Intelligence Benchmark\u2019\n(Aci-bench) dataset for our study. We collaborate with medical pro-\nfessionals to develop a fine-grained taxonomy of physician intents\nbased on the SOAP framework (Subjective, Objective, Assessment,\nand Plan). We then conduct a large-scale annotation effort to la-\nbel over 5000 doctor-patient turns with the help of a large num-\nber of medical experts recruited using Prolific, a popular crowd-\nsourcing platform. This large labeled dataset is an important re-\nsource contribution that we use for benchmarking the state-of-the-\nart generative and encoder models for medical intent classification\ntasks. Our findings show that our models understand the general\nstructure of medical dialogues with high accuracy, but often fail to\nidentify transitions between SOAP categories. We also report for\nthe first time common trajectories in medical dialogue structures\nthat provide valuable insights for designing \u2018differential diagnosis\u2019\nsystems. Finally, we extensively study the impact of intent filter-\ning for medical dialogue summarization and observe a significant\nboost in performance. We make the codes and data, including anno-\ntation guidelines, publicly available at https://github.com/DATEXIS/\nmedical-intent-classification.\n1\nIntroduction\nDoctor-patient dialogues are complex interactions where physicians\nmust efficiently gather information, reason through differential diag-\nnoses, and formulate treatment plans. While NLP research has made\nsignificant strides in tasks like medical entity recognition [34], sum-\nmarization [20], and dialogue act classification [3], most of the work\nin differential diagnosis modeling focuses primarily on retrospective\nclinical notes [10, 11]. However, these notes often present a flattened\nand post hoc representation of patient information, neglecting the\ndynamic trajectories during real-time clinical conversations. These\ndynamic trajectories are non-linear and an evolving process of clini-\ncal reasoning during patient encounters. Clinicians often revise their\n1 Equal contribution.\nSubjective\nAcute Symptoms\nPersonal History\nTherapeutic History\nVegetative History\nDrug History\nFamily History\nOther Socials\nGreetings\nAssessment\nAcute Assessment\nReassessment\nObjective\nPhysical Examination\nRadiology Examination\nLab Examination\nPlan\nMedication\nReferral\nOther Treatments\nFollow-up\nDiscussion\nDiagnostic Testing\nOthers\nChitchat\nFigure 1: Proposed fine-grained physician intent taxonomy in relation\nto the SOAP framework, developed in consultation with medical ex-\nperts.

This dynamic process involves continuous interpre-\ntation and re-interpretation of patient data, which is challenging to\ncapture in static notes.\nIn contrast to static notes, dialogues capture the evolving intents of\nphysicians as they navigate the complexities of a patient encounter.\nWorks such as AMIE [31] demonstrate that state-of-the-art language\nmodels can effectively simulate clinical interviews by synthesizing\npatient interactions. Nonetheless, how physicians transition between\nthese steps remains largely unexplored. To the best of our knowl-\nedge, we present the first comprehensive study of physician intent\ntrajectories within medical dialogues using Aci-bench [38], one of\nthe richest datasets of doctor-patient interactions. In close collabo-\nration with medical professionals, we introduce a fine-grained tax-\nonomy of physician intents as shown in Figure 1, based on the es-\ntablished SOAP framework [32] as our first research contribution.\nThis fine-grained taxonomy includes multiple intents per SOAP cat-\negory, thus providing a highly detailed representation of how clini-\ncians navigate patient engagements.\nAs our second research contribution, we annotate the Aci-bench\ndataset with the proposed intent taxonomy and make it publicly avail-\nable. Through a large-scale crowd-sourcing effort with around 90\nmedical experts recruited through the Prolific platform from across\nthe globe, we annotate more than 5,000 dialogue turns, creating a\nunique resource for analyzing physician trajectories in clinical con-\nversations. The general structure of trajectories during a differential\ndiagnosis [23] is shown in Figure 2.\nWe strongly believe this annotated dataset will facilitate and en-\ncourage more research in this critical, under-explored research area.\narXiv:2508.19077v1  [cs.CL]  26 Aug 2025\n\nAcute Symptoms\nGreetings\nDiscussion\nAcute Assessment\nConversation Start\nConversation End\nPhysical Examination\nMedication\nReferral\nFollow-up\nTherapeutic History\nPhysician intents trajectory in a clinical conversation\nFigure 2: Physician intent trajectory during a clinical conversation. After multiple turns of subjective symptom-taking, the doctor transitions\nto objective examinations to conclude a clinical assessment. Finally, the conversation concludes with multiple turns for treatment planning.\nPlease note that physicians may only use subgraphs of this general structure, depending also on the patient\u2019s comorbidity, clinical history, and\nother factors.\nTo gain a deeper understanding of intent trajectories in doctor-patient\ndialogues and their potential impact on the current state-of-the-art\nmodels, we perform an extensive benchmarking and characterization\nstudy, which forms our third research contribution. We evaluate\ngenerative and encoder-based models on the task of medical intent\nclassification and next intent prediction. Our analysis uncovers key\nchallenges in capturing intent transitions across SOAP categories.\nAdditionally, we identify common physician intent trajectories in\ndoctor-patient dialogues. These trajectories offer valuable insights\nfor the design of dialogue systems to support differential diagnosis.\nAs our final research contribution, we investigate the poten-\ntial impact on current SOTA models that do not explicitly consider\nour proposed fine-grained physician intent taxonomy, over a crit-\nical, downstream task of dialogue-to-medical-note summarization.\nWe observe that filtering dialogues for physician intents improves\nsummarization quality. We release our dataset2, annotation guide-\nlines, and code3 to the community to support further research at the\nintersection of clinical NLP and dialogue-driven clinical decision.\n2\nRelated Work\nRecent work released medical dialogue corpora to accelerate the\ndevelopment of medical dialogue systems (MDS). We divide these\nworks into two distinct groups.\nNon-annotated medical dialogues. These datasets do not contain\nspecific dialogue annotations and have either a small number of ex-\namples [21], only include short dialogues [2], or are not freely ac-\ncessible [16, 40, 12, 9]. Larger datasets like [39] are non-English and\nlack real-world conversations.\nAnnotated medical dialogues. Works such as ReMeDi [35], MIE\n[42], Code-Mixed [8], IMCS-21 [6], and MediTOD [29] curate re-\nsources that align with annotations to solve MDS tasks. Such tasks\ninclude annotations for medical entity recognition, natural language\ngeneration, or dialogue act classification. Our work focuses on a\nmore detailed annotation of physician intents in dialogues guided by\nthe SOAP taxonomy. We use SOAP because it is a widely adopted\nstandard for documenting clinical notes. Therefore, our approach\n2 https://huggingface.co/DATEXIS\n3 https://github.com/DATEXIS/medical-intent-classification\nbridges the gap between the representation of patient interactions in\ndialogues and their documentation in medical notes.\nModeling differential diagnosis in medical dialogue systems. Sev-\neral studies, including AMIE [31], MEDDxAgent [27], and Kim\net al. [15], investigate the application of foundation models in the\ndifferential diagnosis process. These works highlight that the initial\ndialogue phase is the most critical stage, as it shapes the quality and\naccuracy of subsequent diagnostic reasoning. However, the extent to\nwhich these models effectively capture transitions in clinical reason-\ning remains an open research question. Previous studies primarily fo-\ncus on modeling differential diagnoses or generating physician-like\ndialogues. In contrast, our work explicitly analyzes physician intent\ntrajectories within medical conversations. We provide a structured\nframework for understanding how clinicians transition between rea-\nsoning stages in real-time interactions.\n3\nMedical Intent Dataset\nIn this section, we present the annotation taxonomy, outline the ap-\nproach used to develop the annotation guidelines, and discuss the in-\ntent annotation process. Finally, we offer insights into the dynamics\nof medical dialogues across the SOAP categories.\n3.1\nDataset Construction\nData pre-processing.\nWe obtain the utterances in our corpus from\nthe role-played medical dialogue dataset Aci-bench [38]. Aci-bench\nis a dialogue summarization dataset consisting of 207 dialogue-\nclinical note pairs. We select this dataset for annotation due to its\ncomprehensive collection of doctor-patient dialogues spanning var-\nious medical specialties, with an emphasis on authentic clinical in-\nteractions. Each dialogue is organized with clearly defined speaker\nroles, and we segment the dialogues into distinct doctor-patient turns\naccording to these roles. We manually revise dialogues containing\nreversed roles or concatenated utterances to ensure accurate doctor-\npatient turns. After pre-processing, we end up with 5,541 doctor-\npatient turns.\nIntent taxonomy.\nWe design the intent classes to align with the es-\ntablished Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan (SOAP) [32]\n\ntaxonomy. Figure 1 shows a comprehensive overview of all intents.\nThis taxonomy allows us to create intents that break down the dia-\nlogues into specific phases that are crucial for the differential diag-\nnosis process, as we highlight in Figure 2.\nFigure 3 provides the excerpt of the actual dialogue shown pre-\nviously in Figure 2. Multiple, short questions by the physician at\nthe beginning of a dialogue characterize the symptom-taking phase\n(Subjective). We see in Figure 3 that the physician iterates multiple\ntimes on Acute Symptoms and asks for the Therapeutic History of the\npatient. In the examination phase (Objective) the physician collects\nfactual diagnostic observations, such as Physical Examination, Ra-\ndiology Examination, and Lab Examination. The examination phase\ntypically follows the symptom-taking phase and, due to its factual\nnature, requires less repetition than the symptom-taking phase. The\nclinical assessment phase (Assessment) involves diagnosing the pa-\ntient and usually follows the examination phase. As shown in Figures\n2 and 3, the clinical assessment phase is precise, requiring mostly\nno repetitions by the physician. Lastly, the dialogue concludes with\nthe treatment-planning phase (Plan), where the physician and patient\ndiscuss the proposed treatment plan. As illustrated in Figure 2, mul-\ntiple iterations often occur during this phase. These loops emerge as\nthe patient consents to or engages with the proposed plan. This pro-\ncess repeats until both parties agree.\nAnnotation guidelines.\nWe collaborate with practicing physicians\nto develop comprehensive annotation guidelines for physician intent\nclassification. To ensure clarity and consistency, we iteratively refine\nboth the intent taxonomy and the annotation guidelines. Each itera-\ntion involves an external annotator applying the guidelines to a small\nsubset of the dataset, followed by a critical evaluation of ambiguities,\nedge cases, and potential refinements. The finalized guidelines con-\ntain 20 intent classes across 5 categories. For annotation, we adhere\nto standard practices and initially perform the labeling in-house. Sub-\nsequently, we verify the accuracy of the annotations with the help of\nmedical professionals through a crowd-sourcing platform [4, 24, 7].\nWe expand on the annotation process in the supplementary material\n[28].\nData verification.\nMedical professionals, recruited through the\ncrowd-sourcing platform Prolific4, verify our annotations to en-\nsure their reliability. Our effort achieves an annotation accuracy of\n81.13%. We systematically review the remaining 19.87% of cases\nand incorporate annotator feedback, removing samples with unre-\nsolved disagreements. Further details on the verification process are\nprovided in supplementary material [28].\nTable 1: Statistics for categories per turn, category tokens per dia-\nlogue, and the most frequent intent per category in the annotated\ndataset.

We show that doctors invest most turns for\nthe symptom-taking phase, with Acute Symptoms being the most fre-\nquent intent. In contrast, a doctor needs the least turns for the clini-\ncal assessment phase. While the symptom-taking phase has the most\nturns on average, the treatment-planning phase can potentially ex-\ntend over a longer period, as indicated by the maximum number of\nturns observed across all dialogues in Table 1. This is mainly due\nto the nature of the treatment-planning phase, which often involves\ncontinuous discussions and negotiations between the doctor and pa-\ntient about treatment options. Such interactions may require multiple\niterations before both parties reach a mutual agreement.\nDoctors speak most during treatment-planning.\nAlthough the\naverage number of turns in the treatment-planning phase is lower\nthan in the symptom-taking phase, Table 1 shows that the doctor\nspeaks the most during treatment-planning, as indicated by the mean\nnumber of tokens per category. In this phase, Discussion is the most\nfrequent intent. This underscores the difference between the one-\nsided process of collecting subjective symptoms and the collabora-\ntive nature of treatment planning. During symptom collection, the\ndoctor primarily collects information by questioning the patient. In\ncontrast, treatment planning involves both the doctor and the patient\nactively engaging in a dynamic discussion that can evolve without a\npredetermined outcome.\nChitchat in doctor-patient dialogues is omnipresent.\nOn aver-\nage, a dialogue includes more Chitchat turns than turns in the clin-\nical assessment phase. However, despite their frequency, Chitchat\nturns are brief and can appear in every phase of the dialogue. These\nturns contain little to no informational content and can be regarded\nas noise, as they do not aid in the differential diagnosis process.\nConclusion.\nOur findings on the frequency of subjective symptom-\ntaking intents and the omnipresence of chitchat overlap with data\nstatistics published in Yan et al. [35], Saley et al. [29], and Zhang\net al. [42]. Similarly to our distribution, we see that the majority of\nentities are symptom-taking intents and that chitchat is distributed\nacross all dialogues. Since no related work reports utterance length\nstatistics on the intent level, we cannot substantiate our second claim\nthat treatment-planning utterances contain the most words on aver-\nage.\n4\nExperimental Setup\nThis section discusses the evaluation tasks and the baseline mod-\nels used in our experiments. Both tasks are multi-label classifica-\ntion tasks, and we apply stratified sampling [22] to produce training,\nvalidation, and test splits. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation of\nour imbalanced dataset, we report both macro-AUROC and macro-\nAverage Precision (AP). While macro-AUROC evaluates classifi-\ncation performance by measuring the area under the ROC curve,\nmacro-AP provides a more nuanced metric by emphasizing precision\nand recall, particularly for underrepresented classes.\n4.1\nTask Definitions\nTask: Medical intent classification.\nThe medical intent classifica-\ntion task assesses whether a model is capable of mapping physician\n\nDoctor: all right . today i am seeing [...] how are you doing ?\u00a0\nPatient: i'm okay . thank you .\nDoctor: that's good . that's good . tell me what's brings you in today .\u00a0\nPatient: sure . so i've been having constant pain in my left shoulder[...]\nDoctor: mm . that does not sound like fun . it sounds like you injured it going up the stairs ?\nPatient: yes , that's correct . it was icy [...] it's been hurting since .\n[...]\nDoctor: i do not blame you , mr . james . does anything seem to help the pain that you've tried ?\nPatient: not too much . i have iced a bit , [...]\n[...]\nDoctor: [..], i'm going to gently press around your shoulder and elbow [...] .\u00a0\nPatient: okay . it hurts when you press there on my elbow and here on my shoulder .\nDoctor: okay . left shoulder and elbow , tender sa space , no warmth , erythema or deformity.

Each input consists of a single physi-\ncian utterance, and the model is tasked with predicting one or more\nintents.\nWe show the dataset statistics for this task in Table 2.\nTable 2: Intent classification dataset statistics after stratified splitting.\nStatistics\nAll\nTrain\nVal\nTest\nTotal # samples\n5292\n3886\n646\n760\nAvg. # intents\n1.41\n1.46\n1.27\n1.27\nAvg. # sections\n1.11\n1.32\n1.03\n1.04\nAvg. # tokens per utterance\n36.54\n39.19\n28.97\n29.44\nTask: Next intent prediction.\nThe next intent prediction task eval-\nuates whether a model can predict the subsequent physician intent in\nthe trajectory of a doctor-patient dialogue. Each input consists of up\nto five preceding doctor-patient turns, and the model is tasked with\npredicting one or more intents associated with the next step of the\nphysician in the sequence. For cases where the prediction involves\nthe first turn in the dialogue, we prepend a fixed Conversation Start\ntoken to represent the absence of prior context.

The first setting is fine-tuning on the intent classes\nonly, whereas the second setting is a hierarchical fine-tuning. In the\nhierarchical approach, the model first predicts the SOAP categories\nand then the intent classes. We mask intents that do not associate to\nthe predicted SOAP categories from the first step and calculate a loss\nas an average of both steps. The optimizer is AdamW [19].\nDecoder-only models.\nDue to their reasonable size and state-\nof-the-art performance we evaluate Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct [13],\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct [36], and Phi-4-14B [1]. In order to adapt au-\ntoregressive models to classification tasks, we employ guided de-\ncoding and follow Willard and Louf [33]. We enforce the models\nto always generate an output that contains all classes paired with a\nboolean value that indicates the presence or absence of the class in\nthe current utterance. Thus, we can replicate a discrete prediction\nspace and apply classification metrics without the need for sophisti-\ncated post-processing of the output.\nWe refrain from training the decoder-only models and instead eval-\nuate them at inference time in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. In\nthe zero-shot setting, we provide only a simple prompt that instructs\nthe model to classify the current sample. For the few-shot setting,\nwe additionally include (x, y) examples in the prompt. We retrieve\nrelevant examples by computing the BM25 [25] score between the\ninput x and an example corpus C, where C comprises all samples\nfrom the training and validation splits. In few-shot experiments, we\nincorporate the top three retrieved examples. We provide a prompt\nexample in the supplementary material [28].\n5\nExperimental Results and Discussion\nWe present results for all models on both tasks in Table 4 and ana-\nlyze the intent-wise performance of the best-performing model. Fur-\nthermore, we conduct an ablation study with a fine-tuned next intent\nprediction model to reconstruct dialogue sequences.\n5.1\nExperimental Results\nIntent classification.\nFine-tuned encoder-based models consis-\ntently outperform all decoder-only models by at least 70.58% Av-\nerage Precision (AP).

In\nthe few-shot setting, decoder-only models achieve at least 16.39%\nhigher AP than in the zero-shot setting.\nNext intent prediction.\nThe next intent prediction task yields re-\nsults similar to those seen in the intent classification task. As in the\nintent classification task, decoder-only models cannot match the per-\nformance of the fine-tuned encoder models, with a difference of at\nleast 29.78% AP. In this task, hierarchical fine-tuning degrades the\nperformance of the encoder models in both metrics by a large margin.\nWe observe, that AP for GatorTronS drops by 114.89%. Phi-4 and\nQwen2.5 exhibit identical performance, with Llama3.1 trailing be-\nhind. Notably, the decoder-only models do not benefit as much from\nadditional examples as in the prior task. For Phi-4, the AP difference\nbetween zero-shot and few-shot is only 13.33%. The AUROC per-\nformance of Qwen2.5 in the few-shot setting is even lower than in the\nzero-shot setting, suggesting that intent trajectories can vary signifi-\ncantly. Providing similar examples may cause confusion rather than\noffering meaningful support.\n5.2\nIntent Performance Analysis\nTasks differences in robustness towards intent imbalance.\nTable\n4 highlights a discrepancy between AUROC and AP for all models\nin both tasks. Although the model performs well on average, clas-\nsification accuracy decreases across the different intents, indicating\nreduced performance for less frequent or more challenging intent cat-\negories. Figure 4 shows the AUROC and AP scores for both tasks per\nintent, as well as their frequency in the data. In the figure, we order\nthe intents according to the SOAP categories, starting with Subjec-\ntive intents on the left, moving through Objective and Assessment,\nand ending with Plan intents. Chitchat intents are placed on the far\nright.\nOur results demonstrate that the frequency of intents has a negli-\ngible effect on the AP for the intent classification task. However, we\nobserve a clear correlation between AP and intent frequency in the\nnext intent prediction task. This indicates that intent classification\nis more resilient to intent imbalance, while next intent prediction is\nsignificantly affected by this imbalance. We explain this divergent\nbehavior with the complexity of task input. In intent classification,\nthe model only classifies a single utterance, making it less sensitive\nto intent imbalance. In contrast, next intent prediction requires the\nmodel to understand a trajectory of doctor-patient turns, where intent\nsequences can vary. This variability means the model needs more ex-\namples to effectively capture the potential intent combinations, mak-\ning it more susceptible to class imbalance.\nSemantic similarities impact intent classification.\nThe Lab Ex-\namination intent has the lowest AP (0.21) in the intent classification\ntask. In contrast, the other two Objective intents, Physical Exami-\nnation and Radiology Examination, achieve significantly higher AP\nscores of 0.86 and 0.80, respectively. The Lab Examination intent\nand Radiology Examination intent share similar semantic structures,\nsince both involve the examination of diagnostic tests. A closer look\ninto the results reveals that the model misclassifies Lab Examina-\ntion instances as Radiology Examination and Physical Examination.\nThis indicates that the model learns to identify the presence of diag-\nnostic tests, but does not distinguish the subtle differences between\ncertain types of tests. However, in the next intent prediction task, we\ndo not observe such behavior. The different behavior signifies that\nthe two tasks learn to represent the same intents differently. Thus,\neach task poses distinct challenges, even though they share the same\nintent classes.\n5.3\nError Analysis and Reconstructing Dialogue\nSequences\nWe do not present the models with a complete dialogue during\nthe next intent prediction training. However, the ability to compre-\nhend and plan dialogues is essential for models designed to sup-\nport doctors throughout the differential diagnosis process. To inves-\ntigate whether a model fine-tuned on next intent prediction retains\nthese characteristics, we evaluate its ability to reconstruct dialogue\nsequences.\nDialogue type impacts reconstruction accuracy.\nThe cause of a\npatient visiting a doctor determines the type of interview they con-\nduct. We categorized the interviews into two types: linear and non-\nlinear. A dialogue structure is considered linear when the patient\npresents a common complaint that follows standard examination pat-\nterns. These patterns are characterized by distinct transitions across\nthe SOAP phases as detailed in Section 3.1. Cases such as follow-ups\nor annual exams dialogues are non-linear, as the transitions through\nthe SOAP phases do not follow standard patterns. We show exam-\nples of sequences for both types of dialogue in Figure 5. In the lin-\near dialogue, we observe that after 14 turns in the symptom-taking\nphase (Subjective), the physician transitions to the examination phase\n(Objective), followed by the clinical assessment phase (Assessment)\nand several turns dedicated to the treatment-planning phase (Plan).\nThe conversation ends with some Chitchat. As for the non-linear dia-\nlogue, we do not have distinct transitions between the SOAP phases.\nIn turns 9 and 11, the doctor initiates a clinical assessment phase that\ndoes not lead to the treatment-planning phase, but to a symptom-\ntaking phase. We observe the same for the examination phase. The\ndoctor examines the patient in between the symptom-taking phase\ninstead of conducting the examinations in a coherent sequence of\nturns.\nIn summary, the model can reconstruct the sequence of linear di-\nalogues. However, the model fails to predict anomalies for the non-\nlinear dialogue. Instead, it defaults to predicting a linear trajectory.\nModel overconfidence limits precision.\nWe show additional ex-\namples of reconstructed sequences in Figure 5. Specifically, we show\na comparison between a high-scoring sequence and a low-scoring se-\nquence in terms of average precision. In both examples, we see that\nthe model predicts more intents than are actually annotated in the\n\nAcute Symptoms\nPersonal History\nTherapeutic History\nVegetative History\nDrug History\nFamily History\nOther Socials\nGreetings\nPhysical Examination\nRadiology Examination\nLab Examination\nAcute Assessment\nReassessment\nDiscussion\nMedication\nDiagnostic Testing\nOther Treatments\nFollow-up\nReferral\nChitchat\nIntent\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nMacro-Scores\nPerformance differences for both tasks on all intents\nNIP AUROC\nNIP AP\nIC AUROC\nIC AP\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.10\n0.12\n0.14\nNormalized Frequency\nClass Frequency\nFigure 4: GatorTronS AUROC and AP performance across all intents for both tasks, organized by SOAP categories.

Furthermore, the model has a tendency to continue sequences\nas Chitchat.\nModel does not learn phase transitions.\nIn all the examples\nshown in Figure 5, the model does not predict the phase transitions\nin the correct turns. We identify two transition error classes. The first\none is that the model predicts a transition one turn too late. This in-\ndicates that the model depends on the content of the previous turns\nto change phases rather than on learned trajectories. The second er-\nror class is a premature transition by the model, especially present in\nphase transitions from Subjective to Objective. Despite the fact that\nthe doctor has not concluded the symptom-taking phase, the model\nwants to transition to the objective examination phase after 9 turns.\n6\nImpact of Intent Classification on Medical\nDialogue Summarization\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of models trained on our intent classi-\nfication dataset, we integrate them into downstream summarization\ntasks as outlined in Yim et al. [38]. We test on all five summarization\ntasks: full note, subjective, objective exam, objective results, and as-\nsessment and plan. Each task takes a doctor-patient dialogue as input\nand generates a medical note. For instance, in the subjective task, we\nonly summarize the subjective findings of the patient, whereas in the\nassessment and plan task, we summarize the diagnosis and treatment\nplans.\n\nProposed methodology.\nA fine-tuned intent classification model\nfilters the input dialogue before summarization; we use the best per-\nforming GatorTronS from Section 5. The filter removes non-medical\nutterances or retains those relevant to the specific note categories. For\nfull-note summarization, we discard utterances classified as Chitchat\nand retain all others. In subjective summarization, only Subjective\nutterances are kept. Objective exam summarization includes Objec-\ntive category utterances with a Physical Examination intent. Objec-\ntive results summarization also retains Objective category utterances\nbut requires the Lab Examination and/or the Radiology Examination\nintent. Finally, the assessment and plan summarization keeps only\nutterances from the Assessment or Plan categories.\nExperimental setup.\nWe fine-tune a BART-large [17] using the\nhyperparameters from Yim et al. [38] and employ the same decoder-\nonly models as in the intent classification experiments, with the addi-\ntion of GPT-4o. For decoder-only models, we set the temperature to\n0.2 and limit new tokens to 512 for full-note summarization and 256\nfor section-level summarization. We infer them in a zero-shot and\nfew-shot setting, with BM25 as the candidate retriever and 3 candi-\ndates per sample. Additional candidates consist of dialogue and sum-\nmary. Performance is reported using F1-macro for Rouge-1, Rouge-\n2, Rouge-Lsum [18], Medcon [30], BERTScore [41], and the average\nfor all metrics.\nExperimental results.\nWe report in Table 5 results only for the\nBART model and the best-performing model per task. We provide the\nfull result tables in the supplementary materials. Decoder-only mod-\nels in the few-shot setting consistently achieve the highest scores,\noutperforming the zero-shot setting averaged across all tasks by\n28.93% and the fine-tuned BART by 63.17%. The significant perfor-\nmance gap between the decoder-only models and BART is twofold.\nFirst, the training data consists of too few samples and too much\nvariance; consequently, the training signal is too coarse for effective\nfine-tuning. Second, the average dialogue length in Aci-bench ex-\nceeds the 1024 maximum input length of BART; thus, the model has\nto truncate the input and omit information. Filtering generally im-\nproves the performance of decoder-only models by 5.39%. The filter\nsignificantly decreases the performance for BART in full-note and\nsubjective summarization by 21.05% and 50%, respectively, but im-\nproves the decoder-only models in those tasks by 1.63% and 10%.\nThe largest improvement occurs in objective exam summarization\nwith an increase of 72.22% for BART and 15.38% for the decoder-\nonly model.\nExperimental results.\nQualitative assessment of filter effectiveness.\nTo assess the ef-\nfectiveness of intent filtering for summary generation, we perform\na comparison between all GPT-4o outputs and the reference sum-\nmaries. We chose GPT-4o for this evaluation, as it produces the most\nconsistent results across all summarization tasks. We provide exam-\nples in the supplementary material.\n\u2022 Reduction of verbosity in summaries. Since we exclude un-\nwanted information in the dialogue and reduce noise in the input,\nthe filter reduces the verbosity of the generated notes in all sum-\nmarization tasks. We observe the greatest impact on the objective\nexam task. In this task, we summarize the Physical Examination\n(PE) findings and notes are usually very short. In addition, we see\nimprovements in full-note summarization for chitchat-heavy dia-\nlogues.\n\u2022 Utterance complexity determines filtered dialogue density.

Noise persists in the input dialogue and reduces the\npotential summarization quality.\n\u2022 Information loss due to incorrect classification. The filtering\nmodel occasionally misclassifies utterances, leading to the omis-\nsion of relevant information. In such cases, the filtered input di-\nalogues are incomplete, and the summaries perform worse than\ntheir unfiltered counterparts. The objective results summarization\nhighlights this behavior. This category focuses on Radiology- and\nLab Examination (LE) utterances. As discussed in Section 5.2,\nthe model has a tendency to misclassify LE utterances as Physical\nExamination (PE). Since we filter PE utterances for this category,\nwe lose valuable information and score worse than the unfiltered\nsummarization.\nIn summary, filtering improves performance, particularly for\nSOAP category-specific summarization, by creating dense input dia-\nlogues, which reduces the verbosity in the summary. We see that this\nworks well for categories in which utterances are less complex, but\nnot as well for categories with more complex utterances. However,\nincorrect classification can significantly degrade performance if key\nutterances are excluded from the input dialogue.\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn this work, we present \"Where does it hurt?\" - a novel medical in-\ntent classification dataset for dialogues. We introduce the complete\nannotation process and describe the taxonomy based on the SOAP\nframework. This adaptation of the SOAP framework for dialogues\nallows us to conclude that physicians spend the most turns on sub-\njective symptom-taking, but talk the most during treatment-planning.\nFurthermore, we conduct extensive experimental studies on an in-\ntent classification task and a next intent prediction task. We show\nthat classically fine-tuned encoder-only models perform best in both\ntasks. Language models learn to classify doctor utterances to medical\nintents but struggle to predict the next intent for a sequence of doctor-\npatient turns. We examine the robustness of medical intent classi-\nfication models towards class imbalance and present challenges in\nreconstructing dialogue trajectories with next intent prediction mod-\nels. Lastly, we utilize a model trained on our dataset as a filter in a\ndownstream summarization task and show improved summarization\nperformance against baselines.\nFuture Work.\nFirst, the dialogue reconstruction experiment in\nSection 5.3 shows that the models learn to follow trajectories but\nfail to identify category transitions. Further investigation to improve\ntransition capabilities can lead to better overall reconstruction qual-\nity. Second, the findings that we acquire on physician behavior dur-\ning dialogues and common intent trajectories can be utilized to cre-\nate more sophisticated dialogue generation methods, especially in the\ncontext of medical note-to-dialogue transcription.\nLimitations.\nFirst, we source the dialogues for the annotation from\nthe popular Aci-bench benchmark dataset [38], where the dialogues\nare role-played and thus do not need further de-identification, and\nas such may not properly reflect a real-world scenario. Second, we\nfine-tune the encoder models in our experiments, but do not fine-tune\nthe decoder-only models because of computational and budget con-\nstraints. Therefore, the performance comparison may unfairly favor\nthe encoder models.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank the reviewers for their helpful suggestions\nand comments.

This arises from their lack of macroscopic guid-\nance, causing disorientation and failures in complex tasks,\nas well as insufficient continuous oversight during execution,\nrendering them unresponsive to environmental changes and\nprone to deviations. To tackle these challenges, we introduce\nHIPLAN, a hierarchical planning framework that provides\nadaptive global-local guidance to boost LLM-based agents\u2019\ndecision-making. HIPLAN decomposes complex tasks into\nmilestone action guides for general direction and step-wise\nhints for detailed actions. During the offline phase, we con-\nstruct a milestone library from expert demonstrations, en-\nabling structured experience reuse by retrieving semantically\nsimilar tasks and milestones. In the execution phase, trajec-\ntory segments from past milestones are dynamically adapted\nto generate step-wise hints that align current observations\nwith the milestone objectives, bridging gaps and correct-\ning deviations. Extensive experiments across two challenging\nbenchmarks demonstrate that HIPLAN substantially outper-\nforms strong baselines, and ablation studies validate the com-\nplementary benefits of its hierarchical components.\n1\nIntroduction\nLarge language model (LLM)-based agents have recently\ndemonstrated remarkable capabilities in a wide range of\ndecision-making and reasoning tasks(Durante et al. 2024;\nXi et al. 2025; Wang et al. 2024; Huang et al. 2024). Their\nproficiency in understanding complex instructions and gen-\nerating coherent, context-aware responses has enabled the\nautomation of various applications. Despite these advances,\nenabling LLM-based agents to effectively plan and act over\nlong horizons remains a fundamental challenge, especially\ngiven the complexity of real-world tasks and the dynamic\nnature of environments.\nExisting research has approached these challenges from\ntwo main perspectives. High-level planning methods (Khot\net al. 2023; Wang et al. 2023) allow agents to decompose\ntasks into subgoals, providing clear overall direction and\nguiding the agent\u2019s progress toward fulfilling the final objec-\ntives. However, such methods often exhibit limited flexibil-\nity in handling unexpected execution errors or dynamically\n*Corresponding Author\nadapting actions when the environment changes (see Fig.1;\nTop-Left). Furthermore, these methods often rely on com-\nplete historical trajectories of specific tasks as demonstra-\ntions, which introduces excessive task-specific details that\nhinder generalization and reduce robustness in new scenar-\nios. Step-wise methods (Yao et al. 2023b; Zhou et al. 2024)\nexcel at adapting actions to real-time observations. How-\never, this finer-grained focus frequently leads the agent to\nlose sight of the overall task structure, making it prone to\ninefficient or locally optimal behaviors\u2014especially in long-\nhorizon or unfamiliar tasks (see Fig.1; Top-Right). More-\nover, step-wise methods often struggle to effectively reuse\nprior experience beyond immediate observations, hindering\ntheir scalability and adaptability in diverse tasks.\nTo overcome existing limitations, we propose HIPLAN,\na hierarchical planning framework that endows LLM-based\nagents with adaptive global-local guidance (see Fig.1; Bot-\ntom). At the macro level, HIPLAN employs a milestone ac-\ntion guide as a \u2019roadmap\u2019 delineating critical task stages\nto maintain global direction and avoid local optima, while\nat the micro level, step-wise hints act like real-time \u2019traffic\nupdates\u2019, providing fine-grained feedback to correct actions\nand align progress with current milestones. This synergy en-\nhances efficiency, controllability, and overall robustness.\nA core innovation of HIPLAN is its effective reuse of his-\ntorical experience through a milestone library constructed\noffline from expert demonstrations. During execution, this\nlibrary guides the generation of the high-level milestone ac-\ntion guide, enabling the agent to learn from prior experience\nat a macro scale. For the step-wise hint generation, HIPLAN\nretrieves trajectory fragments corresponding to similar com-\npleted milestones, providing fine-grained, context-relevant\nguidance. We select milestone-level experience for reuse be-\ncause action-level trajectories are often too dependent on\nspecific contexts to offer useful information, while task-level\ntrajectories include excessive details that introduce noise.\nPositioned between these two, milestone-level trajectories\nserve as ideal units of intermediate granularity, balancing in-\nformativeness and generalizability for effective retrieval and\nplanning.\nWe evaluate HIPLAN on two challenging benchmarks,\nALFWorld (Shridhar et al. 2021) and WebShop (Yao et al.\n2022), featuring complex long-horizon tasks. Results show\nHIPLAN consistently outperforms strong baselines with\narXiv:2508.19076v1  [cs.CL]  26 Aug 2025\n\nFigure 1: Top-Left: High-level planning with global sub-\ngoals lacking flexibility; Top-Right: Step-wise methods\nwith local adaptability but limited global guidance; Bottom:\nHIPLAN\u2019s hierarchical approach combining milestone guid-\nance and step-wise hints for adaptive and robust planning.\nhigher success rates and greater robustness. Ablation stud-\nies confirm the essential contributions of milestone action\nguide and step-wise hints to the overall performance. Our\nmain contributions are summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We introduce HIPLAN, a novel hierarchical planning\nframework that tightly integrates global milestone ac-\ntion guides with local step-wise hints, achieving adaptive\nglobal-local guidance for agent planning.\n\u2022 We propose an efficient milestone-level experience reuse\nstrategy that allows agents to draw on prior demonstra-\ntions in a way that is both generalizable and actionable.\n\u2022 We conduct extensive experiments on multiple chal-\nlenging benchmarks, demonstrating that HIPLAN signif-\nicantly improves task success rates and robustness com-\npared to strong baselines, confirming its effectiveness\nacross diverse decision-making scenarios.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nLLM-Based Agent for Planning\nLLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across di-\nverse domains, excelling in various aspects such as com-\nplex reasoning (Wei et al. 2022; Yao et al. 2023a), problem-\nsolving (Li, Chang, and Le 2024; Xu et al. 2024), and\ntext generation(Gao et al. 2023; Chang et al. 2025). Build-\ning on these core competencies, recent advancements have\nextended their application to more challenging scenarios,\nwhere LLM-based agents exhibit promising potential in au-\ntonomous decision-making and planning.\nCurrent planning approaches for LLM-based agents can\nbe broadly categorized into two primary paradigms. High-\nlevel planning methods (Erdogan et al. 2025; Sun et al. 2024;\nWang et al. 2023; Khot et al. 2023) focus on decomposing\ncomplex tasks into structured subgoals or generating com-\nprehensive plans before execution. These approaches pro-\nvide clear overall direction and maintain global coherence\nthroughout task execution. However, such methods often ex-\nhibit limited flexibility when encountering unexpected exe-\ncution errors or adapting to dynamic environmental changes.\nStep-wise planning methods (Yao et al. 2023b; Zhou et al.\n2024; Nguyen and Shareghi 2024) excel at real-time adapta-\ntion by interleaving reasoning and action steps. These meth-\nods enable agents to adjust their strategies based on immedi-\nate observations and environmental feedback, making them\nhighly responsive to changing conditions. Nevertheless, this\nfine-grained focus frequently leads agents to lose sight of the\noverall task structure, resulting in inefficient exploration or\nlocally optimal behaviors, particularly in long-horizon sce-\nnarios.\nAdditional\nrepresentative\napproaches\nencompass\nmemory-augmented systems (Zhao et al. 2024; Hu et al.\n2024) that leverage historical experiences for improved\ndecision-making, and reflection-based frameworks (Shinn\net al. 2023) that enable agents to learn from failures through\nself-critique and iterative improvement.\nDespite these advances, existing methods face fundamen-\ntal limitations in achieving both global coherence and local\nadaptability simultaneously. Our work addresses this by in-\ntegrating global milestone action guides with local step-wise\nhints, enabling adaptive global-local guidance for enhanced\nefficiency and robustness in long-horizon tasks.\n2.2\nRetrieval-Augmented Planning\nRetrieval-augmented\nplanning\n(RAP)\nmethods\nen-\nhance\nLLM-based\nagents\nby\nretrieving\npast\nexperi-\nences\u2014trajectories, plans, or instruction graphs\u2014to ground\nplanning in real execution data.\nOne approach retrieves relevant exemplars or context\nfragments conditioned on task similarity, enabling improved\nplanning in both text-only and multimodal environments\n(Liu et al. 2022; Trivedi et al. 2023; Zhou et al. 2024).\nA second strand organizes retrieval around abstract, struc-\ntured representations\u2014such as instruction graphs\u2014to im-\nprove transferability and generalization (Kim et al. 2024;\nWang et al. 2025).\nDespite their strength, existing RAP approaches often rely\nheavily on full exemplar retrieval, which can introduce noise\nand limit flexibility.

The environment is formalized as a par-\ntially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), rep-\nresented as M = (S, A, O, T), where S denotes the set of\nlatent environment states, A the discrete action space, O the\nobservation space, and T : S \u00d7 A \u2192S the transition func-\ntion.\nAt the beginning of each episode, the agent is provided\nwith a task instruction \u03c4 \u2208T , expressed in natural language.\nOver a sequence of steps t = 1, 2, . . . , T, the agent receives\nobservations ot \u2208O and selects actions at \u2208A, aiming\nto reach a successful terminal state that satisfies \u03c4, despite\npartial observability and complex dynamics.\n4\nMethod\nWe propose HIPLAN, a hierarchical planning framework\nthat equips LLM-based agents with adaptive global-local\nguidance for tackling long-horizon tasks.\n4.1\nOverview\nFig. 2 illustrates the overall architecture and workflow of\nHIPLAN. Our method decomposes complex tasks into a se-\nquence of critical milestones forming a high-level action\nguide, while progressively generating fine-grained step-wise\nhints to refine each action based on real-time observations.\nTo facilitate structured planning and control, we as-\nsume access to a set of successful task demonstrations\nD\n=\n{(\u03c4 (i), \u03be(i))}N\ni=1, where each trajectory \u03be(i)\n=\nh\n(o(i)\n1 , a(i)\n1 ), . . . , (o(i)\nT (i), a(i)\nT (i))\ni\ncorresponds to a task \u03c4 (i).\nFrom these demonstrations, HIPLAN constructs a milestone\nlibrary and retrieves structured experience during execution.\nWe introduce two complementary forms of guidance for\nhierarchical planning:\n\u2022 Global Guidance: A milestone action guide G\u03c4\n=\n[m1, m2, . . . , mK], where each mk is a natural language\nsubgoal that represents a critical stage in completing the\ntask. This sequence provides a high-level plan structure\nwhich serves as the coarse-grained directional guidance.\n\u2022 Local Guidance: A step-wise hint ht, generated at each\ntimestep by retrieving trajectory fragments that corre-\nspond to the current milestone. This hint offers fine-\ngrained behavioral suggestions conditioned on the cur-\nrent observation and subgoal.\nThe agent\u2019s policy \u03c0 : (\u03c4, ot, G\u03c4, ht) \u2192at integrates both\nlevels of guidance to produce context-aware, goal-directed\nactions. The combination of a global roadmap and local-\nized hint and retrieval enables robust and efficient decision-\nmaking in complex long-horizon tasks.\n4.2\nOffline Phase: Milestone Library\nConstruction\nHIPLAN constructs a milestone library ML from the set\nof successful demonstrations D = {(\u03c4 (i), \u03be(i))}N\ni=1. For\neach trajectory \u03be(\u27e9), we segment it into K(i) contiguous\nfragments {\u03b6(i)\nk }K(i)\nk=1 , each corresponding to a semantically\nmeaningful subgoal. An LLM is prompted to generate a nat-\nural language description m(i)\nk\nfor each segment, forming a\nmilestone sequence G\u03c4 (i) = [m(i)\n1 , . . . , m(i)\nK(i)].\nTo support efficient retrieval, each instruction and mile-\nstone is embedded into a dense vector space. The milestone\nlibrary stores tuples of the form:\n(v(i)\ntask, v(i,k)\nmilestone, \u03c4 (i), m(i)\nk , \u03b6(i)\nk ),\nwhere v(i)\ntask and v(i,k)\nmilestone are vector representations for the\ntask \u03c4 (i) and the milestone m(i)\nk , respectively. Similarity is\ncomputed via dot product over normalized embeddings.\nThe final milestone library is defined as:\nML =\nN\n[\ni=1\nK(i)\n[\nk=1\nn\n(v(i)\ntask, v(i,k)\nmilestone, m(i)\nk , \u03b6(i)\nk )\no\n.\nThe milestone library abstracts higher-level structured ex-\nperiences while preserving task-specific low-level details.\nCompared to raw trajectory or task-level retrieval, this mid-\ngranularity representation provides a balanced trade-off be-\ntween generalizability and specificity, making it ideal for hi-\nerarchical planning under varied conditions.\n4.3\nExecution Phase: Hierarchical Planning and\nExecution\nIn the execution phase, HIPLAN performs hierarchical plan-\nning by dynamically integrating global milestone guidance\nand fine-grained step-wise hints. Leveraging structured ex-\nperiences from the milestone library, our framework pro-\nvides an adaptive planning mechanism that maintains global\nconsistency and facilitates local flexibility, as illustrated in\nFig. 2. We assume this dual-level approach can help mit-\nigate common issues in long-horizon task execution, such\nas deviation from global objectives and inability to adapt to\nreal-time uncertainties.\nGlobal Guidance: Milestone Action Guide\nTo estab-\nlish strategic direction for long-horizon task completion,\nHIPLAN provides global guidance through a dynamically\ngenerated milestone action guide. Given a test-time task in-\nstruction \u03c4, HIPLAN retrieves similar task entries from the\nmilestone library using the embedding of \u03c4 as the query key:\n{(\u03c4 (j), \u03be(j), G\u03c4 (j))}M\nj=1 = Retrieve(v\u03c4)\n(1)\nThese entries include task instructions, trajectories, and\ncorresponding milestone sequences, which serve as refer-\nences to generate a tailored guide:\nG\u03c4 = LLM(\u03c4, {(\u03c4 (j), \u03be(j), G\u03c4 (j))}M\nj=1),\n(2)\nwhere G\u03c4 = [m1, m2, . . . , mK] and each mk is a critical\nsubgoal adapted to the current task context.\nThis process aims to transfer insights from historical ex-\nperiences, enabling the agent to benefit from past successful\nplanning strategies while maintaining flexibility to handle\nnew task dynamics.\n\nFigure 2: The HIPLAN framework. In the offline phase (top left), a milestone library is constructed from expert demonstrations.\nDuring online execution (right), the agent utilizes this library by retrieving relevant task and milestone-level experiences to\ngenerate a global Milestone Action Guide and local Step-Wise Hints, enabling adaptive planning.\nLocal Guidance: Step-Wise Hints\nComplementing the\nglobal milestone structure, HIPLAN provides detailed lo-\ncal guidance through context-awareness step-wise hints, dy-\nnamically generated at each step. At timestep t, the cur-\nrent milestone m\u03c8(t) is identified, and its embedding vm\u03c8(t)\nserves as the query key to retrieve similar milestones and\ntheir corresponding trajectory segments from the milestone\nlibrary:\n{(m\u2217\nl , \u03b6\u2217\nl )}P\nl=1 = Retrieve(vm\u03c8(t)),\n(3)\nwhere m\u2217\nl and \u03b6\u2217\nl denote retrieved milestones and the tra-\njectory segments that complete them, respectively. These re-\ntrieved elements are then used as references, combined with\npast action-observation pairs {(os, as)}t\ns=1, to generate the\nstep-wise hint ht:\nht = LLM(mk, {(os, as)}t\ns=1, {(m\u2217\nl , \u03b6\u2217\nl )}P\nl=1).\n(4)\nEach hint explicitly highlights the current state context,\nthe gap to the milestone, and, when necessary, corrections to\nthe agent\u2019s intended actions, thus providing immediate feed-\nback to rectify errors or inefficiencies:\nht = {State Context, Milestone Gap, Action Correction}.\nThe step-wise hints dynamically track the agent\u2019s progres-\nsion, recognizing when milestone subgoals are achieved and\nseamlessly guiding the agent toward subsequent objectives.\nDual-level Guidance Enhanced Policy\nAt each timestep\nt, the agent leverages the milestone action guide to maintain\nglobal task coherence, while simultaneously utilizing step-\nwise hints to adaptively transition between milestones based\non real-time observations.\nFormally, the integrated policy \u03c0 combines these two\ncomplementary sources of guidance as:\nat = \u03c0(\u03c4, {(os, as)}t\ns=1, mk, ht)\n(5)\nIn this formulation, HIPLAN performs adaptive hierarchi-\ncal planning by closely integrating the global milestone ac-\ntion guide with dynamic local step-wise hints. The detailed\nalgorithmic workflow is presented in Alg. 1.\n5\nExperiment\n5.1\nExperimental Setup\nDatasets\nWe evaluate HIPLAN on two widely used bench-\nmarks for long-horizon decision-making:\nALFWorld (Shridhar et al. 2021) is a text-based bench-\nmark that challenges an agent\u2019s ability to perform complex,\nmulti-step tasks in a simulated household environment. The\nbenchmark comprises six distinct task types: Pick & Place,\nPick Two & Place, Examine in Light, Clean & Place, Heat\n& Place, and Cool & Place, testing an agent\u2019s capacity for\nunderstanding object states and interactions, and executing\nlong action sequences that can exceed 50 steps.

It tests an agent\u2019s ability to\nground natural language instructions into a sequence of\nsearch and click actions to purchase a specific product. We\nevaluate HIPLAN on a set of 200 test instructions, report-\ning the average reward, which reflects the degree of attribute\nalignment with the request, and the success rate, which mea-\nsures the fraction of tasks where all specifications are satis-\nfied perfectly.\nImplementation\nDetails\nTo\nconstruct\nthe\nmilestone\nlibrary, we collect successful expert trajectories from both\nALFWorld and WebShop. Each trajectory is segmented into\nkey milestones using GPT-4o (gpt-4o-2024-08-06).\nTask instructions and extracted milestone descriptions\nare\nencoded\nusing\nthe\nSentenceTransformers\nmodel\nall-mpnet-base-v2, and indexed via inner-product\nsimilarity for efficient retrieval.\nAll components of HIPLAN\u2014including milestone ac-\ntion guide generation, step-wise hint construction, and fi-\nnal action prediction\u2014are executed by the same underlying\nLLM. We evaluate the framework using two open-source\nmodels: Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1 (denoted\nas Mixtral) and LLaMA-3.3-70B-Instruct (denoted\nas LLaMA). These two represent distinct model architec-\ntures: Mixtral is a sparse mixture-of-experts (SMoE) model,\nwhile LLaMA is a dense pre-trained LLM. This choice\nallows us to assess HIPLAN\u2019s generality across different\nmodel types while ensuring reproducibility.\nIn line with prior work, we limit each episode to at most\n50 steps in ALFWorld and 40 steps in WebShop. All outputs\nfrom LLMs are generated deterministically with tempera-\nture set to 0.0 to ensure consistent and reproducible results.\nBaselines\nWe compare HIPLAN against three strong\nLLM-based planning baselines, each representative of a dis-\ntinct approach to decision-making:\nREACT\n(Yao\net\nal.\n2023b)\nexemplifies\nclassical\nplanning-style methods, where reasoning and acting are in-\nterleaved through chain-of-thought prompting and action\ngeneration. It enables the agent to maintain high-level plans,\nupdate them on the fly, and interface with the environment\nin a structured manner.\nReflexion (Shinn et al. 2023) represents the class of\nreflection-driven methods. Instead of parameter updates, it\nleverages self-generated linguistic feedback to iteratively\nimprove performance across episodes. The agent reflects on\npast outcomes, maintains episodic memory, and refines its\nbehavior through natural language reasoning.\nTRAD (Zhou et al. 2024) is a retrieval-augmented\nmethod that improves in-context decision-making by select-\ning trajectory segments based on thought-level similarity.\nBy aligning these fragments and filtering irrelevant context,\nTRAD enables agents to draw more directly on prior demon-\nstrations.\nAll baselines are evaluated under the same conditions as\nHIPLAN, using identical environments and LLM backbones\nto ensure a fair comparison. Implementation details for all\nbaselines are provided in Appendix.\n5.2\nMain Results\nWe summarize our experimental results in Tables 1 and 2,\nshowing that HIPLAN consistently outperforms all baseline\nmethods across both ALFWorld and WebShop benchmarks.\nWe discuss these results in detail below.\nALFWorld\nHIPLAN achieves the highest success rates\nacross all task categories, demonstrating substantial im-\nprovements over baselines with absolute gains ranging from\n4% to 23% points for Mixtral and 15% to 44% points for\nLLaMA. While Reflexion method enables agent to reflect on\nfailed trials and retry, its reliance on episode-level feedback\nmakes it struggle to escape similar error patterns, resulting\nin only marginal improvements over REACT. HIPLAN also\nsurpasses the strong retrieval-based TRAD baseline, which\nonly supplies action-level demonstrations without higher-\nlevel goal structure and can introduce noise that misleads the\nagent. Notably, HIPLAN demonstrates larger improvements\non challenging tasks like PutTwo, which involves multiple\n\nModels\nMethod\nPut\nExamine\nClean\nHeat\nCool\nPutTwo\nAll\nMixtral-8x22b\nREACT\n0.46\n0.89\n0.55\n0.83\n0.62\n0.18\n0.59\nREACT+Reflexion\n0.77\n0.89\n0.61\n0.83\n0.62\n0.29\n0.64\nTRAD\n0.75\n0.89\n0.84\n0.70\n0.95\n0.53\n0.78\nHIPLAN\n0.92\n0.94\n0.84\n0.87\n0.71\n0.59\n0.82\nLLaMA3.3-70b\nREACT\n0.50\n0.83\n0.39\n0.65\n0.48\n0.18\n0.50\nREACT+Reflexion\n0.58\n0.83\n0.48\n0.65\n0.57\n0.24\n0.56\nTRAD\n0.96\n0.89\n0.90\n0.65\n0.67\n0.59\n0.79\nHIPLAN\n1.00\n1.00\n0.97\n0.91\n0.90\n0.82\n0.94\nTable 1: Task success rates of HIPLAN and baselines on the ALFWorld benchmark across six task types.\nModels\nMethod\nReward Success Rate\nMixtral-8x22b\nREACT\n0.26\n0.19\nREACT+Reflexion 0.40\n0.24\nTRAD\n0.10\n0.04\nHIPLAN\n0.50\n0.36\nLLaMA3.3-\n70b\nREACT\n0.09\n0.08\nREACT+Reflexion 0.23\n0.12\nTRAD\n0.27\n0.14\nHIPLAN\n0.58\n0.40\nTable 2: Average reward and success rate of HIPLAN and\nbaselines on the WebShop benchmark.\ntarget objects and requires longer action sequences, indicat-\ning that hierarchical guidance becomes increasingly valu-\nable as task complexity rises.\nWebShop\nResults shown in Table 2 reveals a similar\ntrend, with HIPLAN achieving the highest success rates of\n36% (Mixtral) and 40% (LLaMA), outperforming baselines\nby up to 32% absolute points. All baseline methods perform\npoorly on this environment. Interestingly, TRAD shows in-\nconsistent performance, even underperforming REACT and\nReflexion on the Mixtral. This suggests that in WebShop en-\nvironment, directly providing low-level action demonstra-\ntions as in-context examples can often introduce significant\nnoise, severely misguiding the agent and preventing target\nproduct purchase within limited steps. This also indicat-\ning the sensitivity of TRAD to different task characteristics.\nHIPLAN achieves consistent and substantial improvements\nin both average task reward (measuring attribute alignment\nof purchased products) and overall success rate. The su-\nperior task reward indicates that even when HIPLAN fails\nto find the exact target product, it can identifies alternative\nproducts that better satisfy the specified constraints, guided\nby the synergy between high-level and step-wise signals.\nOverall, these experimental results highlight the effec-\ntiveness of HIPLAN\u2019s hierarchical guidance mechanism. By\nleveraging structured milestone-level plans and providing\ndynamic global-local integration, HIPLAN significantly en-\nhances the performance of LLM-based agents in complex,\nlong-horizon tasks. Its robust performance across different\nenvironments and model architectures underscores the gen-\nerality and adaptability of our approach.\n5.3\nAblation Studies\nTo assess the contribution of the core mechanisms in\nHIPLAN, we conduct ablation studies across two environ-\nments by evaluating three variants:\n\u2022 HIPLAN-Direct: Removes both the milestone action\nguide and step-wise hints, relying solely on direct ac-\ntion generation from task instructions, task-level similar\ndemonstrations and observations.\n\u2022 HIPLAN-Milestone: Retains only the high-level mile-\nstone action guide while removing the step-wise hints.\n\u2022 HIPLAN-w/o\nmilestone-level\ndemonstrations:\nIn-\ncludes both milestone action guides and step-wise hints,\nbut constructs step-wise hints without milestone-level\nsimilar trajectory fragments as references from the mile-\nstone library.\nThe results in Fig. 3 demonstrate that all variants under-\nperform HIPLAN across environments and LLMs, which\nhighlight several key findings:\nHierarchical Guidance is Crucial. While HIPLAN-\nMilestone provides modest improvements over the direct\nsetting, the combination with step-wise hints yields sub-\nstantial gains (11-32% points in ALFWorld, 9-11% points\nin WebShop). These results validate the synergy effect of\nHIPLAN\u2019s dual-level guidance.\nMilestone Demonstrations Enhance Planning Quality.\nHIPLAN-w/o milestone-level demonstrations shows consis-\ntent performance drops. This validates the effect of leverag-\ning milestone-level similar experiences from the milestone\nlibrary rather than providing step-wise hints from scratch.\nRobust Generalizability. The performance gains from\nHIPLAN are consistent across both ALFWorld and Web-\nShop,\ndespite\ntheir\ndistinct\ncharacteristics\u2014text-based\n\nFigure 3: Ablation study results across ALFWorld and Web-\nShop with Mixtral and LLaMA. HIPLAN consistently out-\nperforms all ablated variants, validating the importance\nof hierarchical guidance and the reuse of milestone-level\ndemonstrations.\nhousehold versus web navigation. Both LLMs exhibit con-\nsistent cumulative effects from the components. This sug-\ngests that the benefits of hierarchical guidance and experi-\nences reuse generalize across different scenarios and LLMs.\n5.4\nCase Study\nTo better understand how HIPLAN enables adaptive hierar-\nchical planning, we present a case study on the ALFWorld\ntask: \u201cput two soapbar in garbagecan\u201d. This task involves\nlocating and manipulating multiple objects sequentially in\na partially observable environment, making it a challenging\nscenario in this environment.\nAs shown in Fig. 4, HIPLAN initially generates a global\nMilestone Action Guide that decomposes the task into eight\nsequential and interconnected subgoals, spanning from lo-\ncating the first soapbar through to disposing of the second\none.\nDuring execution, HIPLAN leverages local Step-Wise\nHints to guide the agent through each subgoal. The hints are\ndynamically generated by LLM from prior milestone-level\nexperience, enabling the agent to:\n\u2022 Adaptively switch milestones when preceding mile-\nstones are achieved, directing attention to the subse-\nquent milestone (e.g., shifting the objective from \u201cPick\nup soapbar\u201d to \u201cGo to garbagecan\u201d after an item is ac-\nquired).\n\u2022 Narrow milestone gaps by retrieving action sequences\nfrom similar past milestones as references and analyzes\nthe gap between the agent\u2019s current state and the mile-\nstone\u2019s objective to infer the most plausible next action.\n\u2022 Recall relevant memory by injecting contextual infor-\nmation into the hint. For long-horizon tasks, this allows\nthe agent to reuse prior knowledge established in earlier\nsteps (e.g., re-visiting a known soapbar location), thus\nmaintaining context and avoiding redundant actions.\n\u2022 Correct errors by detecting deviations from expected\nprogress (e.g., attempting to drop an item before reach-\ning the garbagecan) and injecting targeted corrections in\nthe hint.\nFigure 4: Illustration of HIPLAN\u2019s hierarchical guidance in\nthe \u201cput two soapbar in garbagecan\u201d task. The diagram high-\nlights milestone transitions (M), gap narrowing, and error\ncorrection via adaptive hints.\nCompared to flat structure baselines like REACT or\nTRAD, which may lack phased goal guidance and step-level\nerror-awareness, HIPLAN achieves more coherent and ro-\nbust progression through long-horizon tasks.\n6\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we introduced HIPLAN, a hierarchical plan-\nning framework that enhances LLM-based agents\u2019 ability to\ntackle complex, long-horizon tasks by synergistically com-\nbining global milestone action guides with adaptive step-\nwise hints. This integration addresses critical challenges in\nmaintaining global coherence while adapting actions to dy-\nnamic local contexts, leveraging milestone-level experience\nreuse to balance generalization and specificity effectively.\nOur extensive experiments demonstrate that HIPLAN signif-\nicantly improves success rates and robustness across diverse\nbenchmarks and model architectures, outperforming strong\nbaselines.\nWhile HIPLAN marks a substantial advancement, several\navenues remain for future exploration. One promising di-\nrection is extending the framework to a broader range of\ntasks and domains to assess its generalizability and scalabil-\nity. Additionally, we plan to investigate methods for summa-\nrizing and abstracting experience gained through step-wise\nhints, enabling effective cross-task knowledge transfer and\nimproving adaptation in novel scenarios.\nWe believe that HIPLAN represents a meaningful step to-\nward empowering LLM-based agents with robust hierarchi-\ncal reasoning and adaptive planning capabilities.

TRAD: Enhancing\nLLM Agents with Step-Wise Thought Retrieval and Aligned\nDecision. In SIGIR, 3\u201313.\n\nA\nFurther Analysis: Step Efficiency\nIn addition to task success rates, a critical measure of an\nagent\u2019s planning capability is its efficiency, i.e., the ability\nto complete tasks in a minimal number of steps. Inefficient\nplanning often leads to redundant actions, error-prone explo-\nration, and failure to complete tasks within a limited step-\nhorizon.\nFigure 5 illustrates the average number of steps taken\nby different methods across the ALFWorld and WebShop\nbenchmarks. HIPLAN consistently requires significantly\nfewer steps to complete tasks compared to all baselines. On\naverage, HIPLAN achieves a remarkable reduction of 28%\nin steps on ALFWorld and 37% on WebShop.\nALFWorld\nHIPLAN outperforms all baselines by a sig-\nnificant margin, reducing the average number of steps by\nup to 51% compared to REACT and by up to 41% com-\npared to Reflexion. Even against the strong retrieval-based\nTRAD baseline, HIPLAN achieves a 25% reduction in re-\nquired steps. The improvements hold consistently for both\nLLaMA and Mixtral backbones.\nWebShop\nA similar trend is observed on WebShop.\nHIPLAN reduces the planning steps by up to 55% com-\npared to REACT and by over 40% relative to Reflexion and\nTRAD.\nAnalysis\nWe attribute the superior step efficiency of\nHIPLAN to its hierarchical guidance mechanism: global\nmilestone action guides maintain strategic direction, while\nadaptive step-wise hints correct deviations and eliminate\nredundant exploration. This dual-level guidance enables\nagents to advance towards goals in a more focused and error-\naverse manner, leading to not only higher success rates but\nalso markedly shorter trajectories. In contrast, REACT often\nexhibits meandering behavior due to its reactive nature, and\nReflexion is prone to repeated similar mistakes as it relies\non post-hoc, episode-level feedback after a failure. While\nTRAD shows competitive performance on task success rate,\nit still requires more steps to complete tasks than HIPLAN,\nsuggesting that its low-level trajectory demonstrations may\nguide agents along suboptimal planning paths.\nThe substantial drop in completion steps across heteroge-\nneous tasks and LLMs confirms the generalizability and ef-\nfectiveness of HIPLAN\u2019s design for long-horizon, complex\ndecision-making tasks.\nB\nMilestone Library Construction Details\nThe milestone library construction process relies on an au-\ntomated pipeline that extracts meaningful subgoals from ex-\npert demonstration trajectories. We employ GPT-4o to seg-\nment each trajectory into semantically coherent milestones\nusing the prompt shown in Figure 6.\nMilestones Extraction and Trajectory Segmentation\nThe extraction process operates on successful task demon-\nstrations D = {(\u03c4 (i), \u03be(i))}N\ni=1, where each trajectory \u03be(i) =\n{(o(i)\n1 , a(i)\n1 ), ..., (o(i)\nT (i), a(i)\nT (i))} corresponds to task \u03c4 (i). For\neach trajectory, the LLM identifies key milestones and maps\ntrajectory segments to corresponding milestones.\nFigure 5: Average steps to task completion on ALFWorld\nand WebShop. HIPLAN consistently achieves goals in fewer\nsteps than baseline methods across both benchmarks, high-\nlighting its superior planning efficiency.\nFor each identified milestone k \u2208{1, . . . , K(i)}, the\nLLM provides:\n\u2022 A description m(i)\nk capturing the subgoal\n\u2022 Action indices I(i)\nk\n= {t(k)\nstart, . . . , t(k)\nend} corresponding\nto the trajectory segment\nThe corresponding trajectory segment is then extracted as:\n\u03b6(i)\nk\n= {(o(i)\nt , a(i)\nt ) : t \u2208I(i)\nk }\nThis segmentation ensures that each \u03b6(i)\nk\nrepresents a co-\nhesive sub-trajectory that accomplishes a specific intermedi-\nate objective toward the overall task completion.\nIndexing and Storage\nThe constructed milestone library\nmaintains a hierarchical organization with two-level in-\ndexing. At the task level, entries are indexed by task\nembedding vectors v(i)\ntask for efficient task-level retrieval.\nAt the milestone level, individual milestones are indexed\nby their semantic embeddings v(i,k)\nmilestone, enabling fine-\ngrained milestone-level retrieval. Each entry stores tu-\nples of the form (v(i)\ntask, v(i,k)\nmilestone, m(i)\nk , \u03b6(i)\nk ). All embed-\ndings are computed using the SentenceTransformers model\nall-mpnet-base-v2.\nThe detailed statistics of the constructed milestone library\nare summarized in Table 3.\nC\nExperience Retrieval Implementation\nThis section provides detailed implementation of the expe-\nrience retrieval mechanisms used in HIPLAN for generating\nglobal milestone action guides and step-wise hints.\nC.1\nTask-Level Retrieval for Global Guidance\nFor generating the milestone action guide G\u03c4, HIPLAN re-\ntrieves M = 2 most similar tasks from the milestone library.\nThe retrieval process follows these steps:\nTask\nEmbedding\nand\nSimilarity\nComputation:\nGiven a test-time task instruction \u03c4, we first encode\nit\ninto\na\ndense\nvector\nusing\nSentenceTransformers\n(all-mpnet-base-v2):\nv\u03c4 = Embed(\u03c4)\n(6)\n\nALFWorld WebShop\n\nMm LLaMA Mm LLaMA\n\u00a9 Mixtral . \u00a9 Mixtral\n\n33.2\n\nHiPlan REACT Reflexion TRAD HiPlan REACT Reflexion TRAD\nMethods Methods\n\nMetric\nALFWorld\nWebShop\nTotal\nSource demonstrations\n500\n77\n577\nAvg. milestones per trajectory\n5.89\n5.00\n5.77\nAvg. actions per milestone\n1.78\n1.11\n1.70\nTotal entries\n2,945\n385\n3,330\nTable 3: Statistics of the constructed milestone library across ALFWorld and WebShop datasets.\nThe similarity between the query task and each stored task\nis computed using normalized dot product:\nsim(v\u03c4, vtask(i)) =\nv\u03c4 \u00b7 vtask(i)\n\u2225v\u03c4\u2225\u2225vtask(i)\u2225\n(7)\nRanking and Selection: Tasks are ranked by similarity in\ndescending order, and the top-M = 2 most similar tasks are\nselected:\n{(\u03c4 (j), \u03be(j), G\u03c4 (j))}M\nj=1 = TopK(sim(v\u03c4, vtask(i)), M) (8)\nLength-based Re-ranking: The retrieved demonstra-\ntions are further re-ranked by trajectory length to prioritize\nshorter, more generalizable examples that provide clearer\nstructural guidance.\nC.2\nMilestone-Level Retrieval for Local\nGuidance\nFor generating step-wise hints ht, HIPLAN retrieves top-\nP = 2 most similar milestones from the milestone library.\nThe process follows similar embedding and similarity com-\nputation steps as global guidance retrieval, but operates at\nthe milestone-level rather than task-level.\nTrajectory-level Deduplication: Since similar mile-\nstones may exist within the same trajectory and could be re-\ncalled together, we enforce that no two selected milestones\ncome from the same expert trajectory to ensure the diversity\nof demonstrations. This prevents over-reliance on specific\ntrajectories and enhances generalization.\nTrajectory Segment Recovery: For each retrieved mile-\nstone, we access the corresponding pre-stored trajectory\nsegment that completes the milestone. For each trajectory\nsegment, we include one additional action step to provide\nforward-looking context.\nWe set M = 2 for global guidance retrieval and P = 2\nfor step-wise hint retrieval based on empirical observations.\nThese values align with established practices in in-context\nlearning, where 2-3 examples typically yield optimal perfor-\nmance without introducing excessive noise or computational\noverhead.\nD\nError Mode Analysis\nDespite the overall strong performance of HIPLAN across\ndiverse long-horizon tasks, we observe certain failure cases\nthat highlight challenges in reasoning under partial observ-\nability and language ambiguity. In this section, we analyze\nthe common error modes on the ALFWorld and WebShop\nbenchmarks. These cases help reveal not only the complex-\nity of the task environments but also opportunities for further\nenhancing hierarchical planning and adaptive reasoning.\nD.1\nALFWorld\nALFWorld poses embodied household tasks in a simulated\nenvironment with partially observable textual descriptions.\nWe identify the following types of failure patterns:\nSemantic Misidentification of Task Entities.\nIn some\ntasks, the agent misidentifies the correct object due to per-\nsistent failure in locating the instructed item, ultimately de-\nfaulting to a semantically or functionally similar alternative.\nFor instance, when tasked with retrieving an \u201capple,\u201d the\nagent may eventually pick up a \u201ctomato\u201d after repeated un-\nsuccessful attempts to find the target. This behavior high-\nlights a core challenge in balancing flexibility and strict in-\nstruction adherence: while the agent adapts to the environ-\nment by choosing an available, plausible object, it risks de-\nviating from the intended goal when precise specification is\nessential.\nInefficient Exploration and Repetition.\nWe observe\ncases where the agent repeatedly visits previously checked\nlocations, especially in environments with many distrac-\ntors. For example, in the task requiring the agent to \u201cheat\nan egg and put it in the garbagecan,\u201d over 40 steps were\nspent re-opening the same refrigerator, drawers, and non-\nexistent objects like \u201cdiningtable 1\u201d before finally locating\nthe egg in an unexpected container (the garbagecan itself).\nSuch inefficient loops can be attributed to the partial observ-\nability of the environment and the difficulty in reasoning\nabout uncommon object placements. While HIPLAN pro-\nvides milestone-level direction, it occasionally lacks fine-\ngrained memory consolidation to prevent redundant behav-\nior in exploration-heavy subtasks.\nFailure to Satisfy Implicit Task Constraints.\nIn cer-\ntain cases, the agent transitions to the next milestone with-\nout fully completing the current one, due to an inaccu-\nrate judgment of milestone completion based on recent ac-\ntions and observations. For example, in the task \u201cput a cool\ntomato in the microwave,\u201d the agent moves the tomato into\nthe microwave without successfully performing the cool-\ning step\u2014despite this being an explicitly defined milestone\nin the generated action guide. This indicates that while\nHIPLAN maintains a structured global plan, it occasionally\nstruggles to determine whether a milestone has been gen-\nuinely achieved from textual cues alone. Such errors reflect\nthe inherent ambiguity in inferring milestone completion in\ntext-only, partially observable environments, where changes\nin object state (e.g., cooled vs. not cooled) may not be ex-\nplicitly described.\n\nD.2\nWebShop\nWebShop introduces a distinct class of long-horizon reason-\ning tasks focused on goal-directed online shopping. We ob-\nserve the following error modes:\nSpecification Drift in Product Selection.\nSome agents\nfail to strictly adhere to all constraints specified in the in-\nstruction, such as size, material, or color. In one example,\nalthough the user explicitly requested a product with \u201c6.76 fl\noz\u201d volume, the agent skipped the option selection step and\ndirectly purchased the default variant. This behavior stems\nfrom partial satisfaction of constraints (e.g., product match\nbut wrong size) and suggests limitations in multi-attribute\nreasoning under ambiguous product descriptions.\nAction Loops and Invalid Sequences.\nWe observe cases\nwhere the agent repeatedly issues invalid or ineffective ac-\ntions, often resulting in prolonged sequences of failure.\nThese loops typically emerge when the agent attempts to\nexecute actions that are not applicable to the current page\nor context\u2014such as clicking a button that does not exist on\nthe current interface. This suggests that, in certain situations,\nthe agent fails to properly analyze the local environment\nbefore acting and does not robustly retry alternative strate-\ngies when actions are invalid. Such behavior underscores the\nchallenge of accurately grounding decision-making in tran-\nsient UI states within text-based environments, and the occa-\nsional lack of sufficient corrective mechanisms in the step-\nwise hint generation process.\nUnderutilization of Available Information.\nIn certain\ntasks, agents overlook available high-quality candidates pre-\nsented early in the session. For example, a correct item ap-\npeared in the first search results but was ignored in favor of\nless suitable alternatives. In some cases, agents also skipped\ndetailed product descriptions and features, leading to pre-\nmature purchase decisions that violated key constraints like\n\u201clace closure\u201d or \u201cwater resistance.\u201d These failures indicate\noccasional overemphasis on surface cues (e.g., color or title\nkeywords) over deeper semantic validation.\nE\nBaselines Implementation Details\nE.1\nREACT\nWe used the official REACT codebase, which includes ex-\nperiments on both ALFWorld and WebShop. All settings\nwere aligned with ours. For ALFWorld, we used the same\n134 out-of-distribution tasks with a maximum of 50 steps.\nFor WebShop, we used the same 200 test queries with a 40-\nstep limit.\nE.2\nReflexion\nWe adopted the official RefleXion codebase, which supports\nexperiments on ALFWorld and WebShop. All settings were\nadjusted to match ours. On ALFWorld, we used the same\n134 out-of-distribution tasks with a 50-step limit, running\nthree reflection rounds. On WebShop, we used the same 200\ntest queries with a 40-step cap, also running three rounds.\nE.3\nTrad\nFor the ALFWorld dataset, we adopted the original TRAD\nimplementation, which includes experiments on this bench-\nmark. We reused the official codebase and modified all set-\ntings to match those used by our method. Specifically, we\nused the same 134 out-of-distribution tasks and capped the\nmaximum number of steps at 50.\nFor the WebShop dataset, the original TRAD paper did\nnot provide experimental results. Therefore, we carefully\nimplemented the method based on the official description.\nAll prompts used in our implementation are shown in Fig. 7\nand Fig. 8. During the WebShop experiments, we used the\nsame 77 expert demonstrations as our method for retrieval\nand the same 200 test tasks. The maximum number of al-\nlowed steps was set to 40.\nF\nPrompts used in HIPLAN\nF.1\nALFWorld\nWe present all prompts utilized in the HIPLAN framework\non ALFWorld in the following figures: Fig. 9, Fig. 10,\nFig. 11.\nF.2\nWebShop\nWe present all prompts utilized in the HIPLAN framework\non ALFWorld in the following figures: Fig. 12, Fig. 13.

Most people would\nagree that such inferences are crucial to truly un-\nderstanding a movie. Despite the significance of\nthis deeper level of understanding, existing movie-\nbased VQA datasets have yet to explore this aspect\n1\narXiv:2508.19026v1  [cs.CL]  26 Aug 2025\n\n\nA\n>\n\n\nass |\n|\n\n\u2014_ \u00abOF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBadr PY\n\nof film comprehension.\nRecent movie-based VQA datasets (Wu and Kra-\nhenbuhl, 2021; Song et al., 2024; Rawal et al.,\n2024) primarily focus on surface-level understand-\ning, neglecting the challenge of comprehending\nmovies at a deeper cognitive level. They predomi-\nnantly address the \u201cwhat\u201d by posing questions such\nas \u201cWhat is the relationship between the actors?\u201d\nor \u201cWhat time does the video take place?\u201d, and\nlargely overlook the \u201chow,\u201d \u201cwhy,\u201d and \u201cwhy not\u201d\nquestions crucial for achieving a profound under-\nstanding of movies. While EgoSchema (Mangalam\net al., 2023) attempts to delve beyond the obvious,\nits more profound questions often remain general.\nWe propose MovieCORE, a novel VQA dataset\ndesigned to engage System-2 thinking\u2014the slow,\ndeliberate, and logical cognitive processes\u2014while\nmaintaining strict relevance to specific video con-\ntent. Unlike existing datasets, MovieCORE em-\nbraces the inherent subjectivity of \"why\" and \"why\nnot\" questions as a feature rather than a limita-\ntion, creating both meaningful challenges and re-\nsearch opportunities. To generate comprehensive\nand faithful question-answer pairs, we develop an\nagentic brainstorming approach that leverages mul-\ntiple large language models (LLMs) as interactive\nthought agents that engage in continuous discus-\nsions to refine QA pairs. We validate the quality of\nthe QAs through rigorous human review of a rep-\nresentative subset. Additionally, we employ quan-\ntitative cognitive metrics to measure our dataset\u2019s\ndepth and syntactic complexity relative to existing\nbenchmarks. Our evaluation of current VQA mod-\nels on MovieCOREreveals critical insights about\ntheir performance on these challenging cognitive\ntasks.

Re-\ncent video understanding benchmarks are often\nbased on movie scenes because films offer a rich\nblend of multimodal content, combining visual,\nlinguistic, and temporal elements within complex\nnarratives. Early efforts like MovieQA (Tapaswi\net al., 2016) explores entire movie understanding\nbut were limited by questions heavily relying on di-\nalogue. TVQA (Lei et al., 2018) requires reasoning\nover multiple events in short TV series clips, inte-\ngrating visuals and subtitles. LVU (Wu and Krahen-\nbuhl, 2021) addresses scaling video comprehension\nto extended sequences, necessitating models to pro-\ncess long temporal contexts. MAD (Soldan et al.,\n2022) and its extension (Han et al., 2023) focus on\nscene-level descriptions through audio and visuals\nbut were mainly used for scene annotation tasks\nwith limited narrative comprehension. MoVQA\n(Zhang et al., 2023) introduces multi-level ques-\ntions, challenging models in temporal perception,\ncausal reasoning, and narrative synthesis. CinePile\n(Rawal et al., 2024) automates large-scale question\ngeneration across varied scenes and question type\nand MovieChat-1k (Song et al., 2024) focuses on\nbasic understanding of cinematic contexts.\nVideo Question-Answering Reasoning.\nText-\nbased reasoning datasets like DROP (Dua et al.,\n2019) and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) handle\ndiscrete reasoning tasks, including counting and\narithmetic, but are limited to textual inputs and do\nnot address the complexities involved in integrat-\ning visual reasoning.

Perception\nTest (Patraucean et al., 2024) broadens perceptual\nreasoning to varied video contexts, assessing high-\nlevel reasoning abilities. Multi-task and complex\nvideo benchmarks, such as MVBench (Li et al.,\n2024), Video-MME (Fu et al., 2024), and MLVU\n(Zhou et al., 2024), integrate multiple reasoning\nchallenges, requiring predictive reasoning, memory\nrecall, and cross-modal inference over long video\nsequences. While these datasets have advanced\nvarious aspects of video understanding, they pre-\ndominantly rely on surface-level comprehension\nof video content. Our work introduces the first\ndataset specifically designed to evaluate System-2\nreasoning in the video domain, requiring models to\nengage in slow, deliberate, and analytical thinking\nprocesses aiming to mirror human approaches to\ncomplex movie understanding.\n3\nMovieCORE Creation and Curation\nTo address the challenge of obtaining question-\nanswer pairs that delve into deeper levels of movie\nunderstanding, we propose an agentic annotation\nworkflow. This approach leverages the deliberative\ncapabilities of multiple LLMs acting as specialized\nagents, each contributing unique perspectives to\nthe annotation process. We start with video context\nextraction to make sure our text-only annotation\nagents have enough information about the video.\n3.1\nVideo Context Extraction\nThe videos for our dataset are sourced from\nMovieChat-1k (Song et al., 2024), a collection of\n1,000 movie clips averaging 10 minutes each. We\nuse 986 of these clips, as 14 were either unavailable\nor lacked necessary annotations. MovieChat-1k,\nalready provides high-level information for each\nvideo, such as temporal setting (e.g., ancient or\nmodern) and metadata like the movie\u2019s genre. Al-\nthough some videos in the original dataset include\ncaptions, we observe inaccuracies and imbalanced\ndescriptions.\nTherefore, we exclude these cap-\ntions, focusing instead on the existing QA pairs\nand movie metadata.\nTo provide video context, we utilize MiniCPM-\nv2.6 (Yao et al., 2024), an open-source model\nwith visual capabilities comparable to GPT-4V. We\nprompt it with a carefully curated set of eight ques-\ntions (shown in Figure S1 in the supplementary\nmaterial) designed to extract a multi-dimensional\nunderstanding of the video. These questions ad-\ndress narrative structure, thematic focus, emotional\ntone, key events, character dynamics, genre, and\ntarget audience. The extracted information serves\nas Data Info priors for our agents.\n3.2\nAgentic Annotation Workflow\nOur workflow, illustrated in Figure 2, employs a\nmulti-agent system orchestrated by a Critic Agent\nacting as the master of ceremonies (MC). Using the\nAgentic AI framework autogen (Wu et al., 2024),\nwe deploy instances of GPT4-o for the VQA Ex-\npert and Meta Reviewer roles (as these positions de-\nmand superior reasoning capabilities), with GPT4-\no-mini powering the other expert agents. The pro-\ncess begins as the Critic Agent receives task instruc-\ntions and video context (Data Info) extracted as\ndescribed in Section 3.1 and sends them to the Sys-\ntem II VQA Expert who generates questions that\nengage System-2 thinking. These initial QA pairs\nare then scrutinized by the Skeptical Researcher,\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle-Pass Annotation: \nQ: How does the interaction between the two main characters (the one in red and black costume and the one in black with cat-like ears) evolve\nthroughout the video, and what might this suggest about their relationship?\nA: The interaction begins with a casual encounter and evolves into a clear partnership as they traverse the city together. This progression in\ntheir relationship suggests a deepening bond based on mutual goals or shared challenges, hinting at themes of teamwork and trust.\nAgentic Annotation: \nQ: Can you provide specific scenes that demonstrate the evolution and motivations of the main characters in their relationship?\nA: Yes, there is a scene where the character in the red and black costume helps the one in black with cat-like ears from falling, showing a bond of\ntrust forming. Another scene depicts them working seamlessly together to navigate a tricky rooftop, reflecting their growing partnership. Their\nmotivations seem rooted in overcoming a common threat, as further evidenced by the scene where they both face the glowing purple heart-shaped\nentity.\nFigure 3: Comparison of single-pass and agentic annotation. The agentic method (bottom) elicits specific scene\ndetails, concrete examples, and detailed story elements, demonstrating the enhanced granularity achieved through\nmulti-agent refinement. Text in blue indicates new, specific details absent in the single-pass version. The single-pass\nannotation (top), on the other hand, while also attempting to ask deeper questions, remains at a more abstract level.\nwho evaluates their contextual relevance and accu-\nracy, often challenging the VQA Expert to provide\nmore concrete evidence. The Detective agent fol-\nlows, suggesting additional questions to uncover\nunderlying motivations and biases. The Meta Re-\nviewer synthesizes these insights, proposing en-\nhancements to the initial VQAs. The Critic Agent\nthen consolidates this feedback for the VQA Ex-\npert to refine the QAs. The process concludes with\nhuman expert evaluation of a subset of the refined\nVQAs, assessing their clarity, depth, relevance, and\nanswerability. This agentic annotation workflow\nmimics collaborative human expert discussions by\nharnessing collective intelligence and mitigating\npotential biases of any single agent1.\nTo ensure the quality and reliability of our\ndataset, we implement a rigorous human verifi-\ncation process. Seven graduate students were re-\ncruited to assess a subset of 30 videos, 30 captions\nand 150 QA pairs. The final human validation\nensures that the resulting VQAs meet the highest\nstandards of quality and depth. We provide more\ndetails on the human validation in Appendix II.3.\n1Wondering why we chose these specific agents? Please\nsee Appendix II.4 and II.5\n3.3\nAgentic versus Single-Pass Annotation\nTo illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed Agen-\ntic Annotation workflow, we compare the quality of\nthe VQAs generated by the System II VQA Expert\nin the initial round (single-pass) and those produced\nthrough our workflow after the agent has gathered\nfeedback and enhancement ideas from other ex-\nperts (agentic annotation). As shown in Figure 3,\nthe agentic annotation approach demonstrates clear\nadvantages over single-pass annotation. While the\nsingle-pass annotation provides a general, abstract\ndescription of character relationships, the agentic\nannotation generates questions that ask for and an-\nswers that deliver specific, concrete details about\nkey scenes that support the relationship develop-\nment of the characters \u2013 including the falling scene,\nrooftop navigation, and confrontation with the pur-\nple heart-shaped entity. The agentic process elicits\nricher context and more granular evidence, mak-\ning the annotations more specific and faithful to\nthe movie content. It also makes the dataset much\nmore valuable for training and evaluating AI sys-\ntems\u2019 understanding of narrative progression and\ncharacter dynamics. This suggests that using mul-\ntiple AI agents as thought partners leads to more\ndetailed and substantive annotations compared to\ntraditional single-pass methods used by other auto-\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset\nParse Tree Depth\nF\u2013K Grade Score\nBT Level\nHO-QA (%)\nQ\nA\nAvg\nQ\nA\nAvg\nMovieChat-1k (Song et al., 2024)\n3.58\n1.31\n2.45\n3.19\n-0.39\n1.4\n1.8\n0.0\nActivityNetQA (Yu et al., 2019)\n4.24\n0.27\n2.26\n2.69\n0.98\n1.84\n1.9\n0.2\nMVBench (Li et al., 2024)\n3.96\n1.71\n2.84\n4.74\n1.47\n3.11\n2.2\n3.4\nEgoSchema (Mangalam et al., 2023)\n6.56\n4.38\n5.47\n10.52\n6.08\n8.30\n3.1\n33.1\nMovieCORE\n5.38\n6.39\n5.88\n12.98\n15.07\n14.03\n4.9\n99.2\nTable 1: Syntactic Complexity and Cognitive Demand Comparison: Parse tree depth, Flesch-Kincaid (F-K) grade\nscores, average Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy (BT) level, and percentage of higher-order questions and answers (HO-QA)\nacross various VQA datasets.

The dataset comprises\n986 videos paired with 4,930 corresponding ques-\ntions and answers and 986 captions. Following the\nsplits of the original MovieChat-1k dataset (Song\net al., 2024), we split MovieCORE into 4080 QAs\nfor training (816 videos) and 850 for testing (170\nvideos). The primary application of MovieCORE\nlies in training and evaluating VQA models\u2019 capa-\nbilities in deeper cognitive tasks. The questions\nare specifically designed to assess models\u2019 abil-\nities to comprehend complex narrative elements,\ncharacter motivations, and subtle contextual cues \u2013\nskills that are crucial for achieving human-like un-\nderstanding of cinematic content. A wordcloud\nof MovieCORE\nis shown in Figure 4 suggest-\ning complex themes regarding character dynam-\nics, emotional resonance, and societal implications\nthrough terms like \u201ctension,\u201d \u201cpsychological,\u201d \u201ccul-\ntural,\u201d and \u201cemotional.\u201d Also, the prominence of\nanalytical terms such as \u201cunderscore\u201d,\u201cdepth,\u201d and\n\u201ccritical,\u201d suggests questions that probe deeper in-\nterpretations and thematic elements rather than just\nliteral plot descriptions.\n4\nExperiments\n4.1\nLinguistic and Cognitive Complexity\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of MovieCORE in\nengaging System-2 thinking and promoting deeper\ncognitive processing, we conduct a series of tests\ndesigned to assess the complexity, readability, and\ncognitive demand of our questions and answers.\nFigure 4: Wordcloud illustrating key themes and con-\ncepts of MovieCORE with terms such as \"emotional\",\n\"character\" and \"influence\" very prominent.\nThese tests include well-established metrics such\nas parse tree depth, Flesch-Kincaid grade score,\nand Bloom\u2019s taxonomy classification. Each pro-\nvides unique insights into different aspects of our\ndataset\u2019s ability to stimulate higher-order think-\ning. Table 1 presents a comparative analysis of\nMovieCORE against other VQA datasets.\nParse Tree Depth measures the syntactic com-\nplexity of sentences by analyzing their hierarchical\nstructure. We utilize this metric to assess the struc-\ntural intricacy of our questions and answers. We\nemploy the spaCy library to generate parse trees\nfor each question and answer in our dataset and re-\ncursively compute their depth as follows. Let d(t)\nbe the depth of a token t in the tree. For a token\nwith children C(t), the depth is defined as:\nd(t) =\n(\n0\nif C(t) = \u2205\n1 + maxc\u2208C(t) d(c)\nif C(t) \u0338= \u2205\n(1)\nwhere d(t) = 0 if t is a leaf node (no children),\nd(t) = 1 + maxc\u2208C(t) d(c) if t has children C(t),\nwith maxc\u2208C(t) d(c) representing the maximum\ndepth of the children of t. For a sentence with mul-\ntiple tokens, the depth of the parse tree D rooted at\nthe token r (root of the sentence) is D = d(r).\nThe depth of these trees are then averaged across\n5\n\n\u201ce life fe e sc NAanL_c control we 6 reflect 2 =\ng e lit 1 | ) conservation a Fa g\n5 tncingte  afPeet jis 1; if seme face 8 cE\n2 enyironmen ta} g? reflects oo e habitat > psychological transitionnatural ecosystem\nSuthority\u00ae animal resilience 8 way om, v\na a juty\nV l ewe [ircernan % threat help focus = landscape Lem urban\n. 1 1 iv) w balance e nt ssirs (LD\ncenvi1 FONMENT srs: within \u00ae..,contrast SN an Wan ee\n83\n200 U: S ee Ga\u201d ae oh recs \u00a9\noO cal crucil f.\nns cit CA | societal 3\n\u00b0 4 a use e portrayal motivation c Es cone oD\net sw ON gst: BEF indoor 3 yal g! ig\n& S o strategy g enatic\nCc =) tiftoeent bit ensionece @ Wenether \u2018es fi Ua\nBO \u2014human might = social 5 derctond!

A greater parse tree depth often corre-\nlates with more complex sentence structures, which\ntypically require more cognitive resources to pro-\ncess. By measuring this, we aim to quantify the\nlinguistic sophistication of our VQAs as compared\nto existing datasets\u2019, hypothesizing that questions\nand answers with higher parse tree depths are more\nlikely to engage System-2 thinking. Table 1 shows\nthat MovieCORE has the highest average parse tree\ndepth compared to the other VQA datasets.\nThe Flesch-Kincaid (F-K) Grade Score is a read-\nability measure that indicates the U.S. grade level\nneeded to understand a text. We calculate this score\nfor both questions and answers in our dataset using\nthe standard Flesch-Kincaid formula below\nF-K Grade Score = 0.39\n\u0000 W\nS\n\u0001\n+ 11.8\n\u0000 Y\nW\n\u0001\n\u221215.59\n(2)\nwhere W is the total number of words in the text, S,\ntotal number of sentences and Y the total number\nof syllables.\nWhile our goal is not to make the content unnec-\nessarily difficult, a moderately high Flesch-Kincaid\nscore indicates that the QAs require a more ad-\nvanced level of comprehension and thinking. As\nshown in Table 1, MovieCORE substantially out-\nperforms other datasets with an average grade score\nof 14.03, with its closest competitor \u2013 EgoSchema\n(Mangalam et al., 2023) \u2013 standing at 8.3.\nBloom\u2019s Taxonomy is a hierarchical model used\nto classify educational learning objectives into lev-\nels of complexity and specificity (Mcdaniel, 1970).\nWe prompt GPT-4o-mini with a comprehensive\nbreakdown of the Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy and ask it to\nclassify each question and answer into one of six\ncognitive levels: Remember (1), Understand (2),\nApply (3), Analyze (4), Evaluate (5), and Create\n(6). Such classification helps us assess the cognitive\ndemand of the QAs. Questions falling into higher\nlevels of Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy (Analyze, Evaluate,\nCreate) require deeper analysis and critical think-\ning skills susceptible to trigger System-2 thinking.\nMovieCORE achieves the highest average Bloom\nTaxonomy Level (BT Level) of 4.9, indicating that\nour questions and answers predominantly engage\nhigher-order cognitive skills, significantly surpass-\ning the other datasets. Additionally, we report the\npercentage of higher-order questions and answers\n(HO-QA), representing the proportion of both ques-\ntions and answers that fall into the upper levels of\nBloom\u2019s Taxonomy (levels 4-6). MovieCORE ex-\ncels in this metric with 99.2% of its questions and\nanswers classified as higher-order.\nAlgorithm 1 ACE: Agentic Choice Enhancement\n1: Input: Video V , Question Q, Beam width\nk = 5\n2: Output: Best response R\u2217\n3: C \u2190VLM.generate(V, Q, beam_width = k)\n4: S \u2190Llama-3.2.score(C) \u25b7Score candidates\n5: R\u2217\u2190arg maxc\u2208C S(c)\n\u25b7Select best\nresponse\n6: return R\u2217\n5\nACE: Agentic Choice Enhancement\nWe propose ACE, a straightforward yet effective ap-\nproach to improving existing video language model\n(VLM) outputs through post-generation refinement.\nOur approach, detailed in Algorithm 1, uses an ex-\nisting VLM and leverages beam search with a width\nof 5 to generate diverse candidate responses, which\nare then re-ranked using the compact 1B-parameter\nLlama-3.2 (MetaAI, 2024) language model. We\nhypothesize that, when engaging in a task requir-\ning deeper deliberation, it is advisable to have a\nsecond pair of eyes to refine one\u2019s thinking. The\nlightweight nature of Llama-3.2 (1B) ensures that\nthis enhancement remains computationally efficient\nwhile significantly improving the quality of gen-\nerated responses. We prompt the model without\nspecific evaluation guidelines, allowing it to lever-\nage its inherent understanding of \u201canswer quality\u201d.\nTable 2 show that this \u201cagentic selection\u201d approach\npaired with HERMES (Faure et al., 2024) (HER-\nMES + ACE) registers an absolute gain of 0.48\ncompared to the baseline VLM, which translates to\nroughly a 16 percent improvement in answer qual-\nity. It also improves InstructBLIP (Dai et al., 2023)\nby 25% (2.63\u21923.29) and MA-LMM (He et al.,\n2024) by 20% (2.79\u21923.35). These results suggest\nthat existing VLMs have untapped potential that\ncan be realized through a simple post-generation\n\u201csecond pair of eyes\u201d strategy, offering a practical\npath to training-free improvement.\nTable 3 shows similar performance across beam\nwidths (3, 5 and 7) for HERMES, suggesting\nACE\u2019s effectiveness stems from the agentic selec-\ntion mechanism itself rather than hyperparameter\nchoices. These results validate our framework\u2019s\nfundamental premise: lightweight post-generation\nrefinement can unlock significant untapped poten-\ntial in existing VLMs.\n6\n\nModel\nAccuracy\nComprehensiveness\nDepth\nEvidence\nCoherence\nAvg.\nProprietary Models\nGemini 2.5-flash\n4.26\n4.50\n4.00\n4.03\n3.84\n4.13\nGemini-1.5-pro\n3.91\n3.81\n3.90\n3.87\n3.79\n3.86\nGPT-4o (08-06)\n4.18\n4.00\n3.98\n3.96\n3.96\n4.02\nZero-Shot Results.\nInstructBlip (Dai et al., 2023)\n1.03\n0.43\n0.85\n0.33\n0.40\n0.61\nMA-LMM (He et al., 2024)\n1.14\n0.63\n0.93\n0.57\n0.67\n0.79\nHERMES (Faure et al., 2024)\n1.77\n1.21\n1.41\n1.28\n0.37\n1.41\nLongVU (Shen et al., 2024)\n2.95\n2.01\n1.94\n2.06\n2.12\n2.22\nmPlug-Owl3 (Ye et al., 2024)\n3.55\n2.75\n2.39\n2.78\n2.82\n2.86\nQwen2.5-VL (Bai et al., 2025)\n3.78\n3.54\n3.36\n3.42\n3.50\n3.52\nInternVL2 (IntenVL, 2024)\n3.80\n3.42\n3.10\n3.37\n3.51\n3.44\nInternVL2.5 (IntenVL, 2024)\n3.87\n3.54\n3.37\n3.65\n3.65\n3.62\nFully-Supervised Results\nInstructBlip (Dai et al., 2023)\n3.25\n2.43\n2.47\n2.61\n2.38\n2.63\nMA-LMM (He et al., 2024)\n3.42\n2.54\n2.66\n2.81\n2.50\n2.79\nHERMES (Faure et al., 2024)\n3.52\n2.72\n2.83\n2.98\n2.62\n2.93\nFully-Supervised Results + ACE (Ours)\nInstructBlip (Dai et al., 2023)\n3.71\n3.15\n3.02\n3.30\n3.25\n3.29 (+0.66)\nMA-LMM (He et al., 2024)\n3.76\n3.24\n3.09\n3.39\n3.30\n3.35 (+0.56)\nHERMES (Faure et al., 2024)\n3.81\n3.30\n3.12\n3.38\n3.42\n3.41 (+0.48)\nTable 2: Performance Comparison of Video Question-Answering Models.

ACE\nimproves performance across all evaluation dimensions\nregardless of the beam size, with no clear winner among\nthe different beam values.\n6\nQuantitative Evaluation\nVQA datasets usually use top-1 accuracy as met-\nrics, but a valid match has to be a perfect match.\nFor instance, there can be one strict answer to the\nquestion \u201cDoes sea appear in the video?\u201d, which is\n\u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d. However, in the age of LLMs and es-\npecially for zero-shot evaluation settings, we might\nget answers such as \u201cit does\u201d or \u201cno sea appears in\nthe video\u201d. In such cases the accuracy would be 0.\nRecently, LLM-assisted evaluation schemes such\nas the one introduced by (Maaz et al., 2023), at-\ntempt to solve this issue by considering synonyms\nor paraphrases as valid matches. This works for\nVQAs where there is a perfect answer, and would\nnot work in our case, especially since accuracy\nfor a System-2 answer is not binary but exists in\na spectrum. Furthermore, we posit that accuracy\nalone is insufficient, therefore we design four other\nLLM-assisted metrics: depth to assess the depth\nof reasoning in the answers, comprehensiveness to\nassess how fully the answer covers all key points\nand relevant details, coherence and clarity, and evi-\ndence to evaluate the quality and relevance of the\nevidence provided. For all of these metrics, we\nprompt GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI, 2024) to assign a\nscore between 0 to 5 to each.\nTable 2 presents a comprehensive evaluation of\nmodel performance across our five assessment crite-\nria. Several key insights emerge from these results:\n(1) Proprietary models significantly outperform\ntheir open-source counterparts. This performance\ngap indicates that large-scale proprietary training\ndata likely contains more diverse reasoning tasks\nthan those available in public datasets. (2) In the\nzero-shot setting, most open-source models strug-\ngle considerably with complex reasoning, except\nfor the more recent InternVL2.5 and Qwen2.5-VL\nmodels. The particularly low scores in Depth and\nEvidence metrics highlight these models\u2019 difficulty\nin formulating multi-step inferences and ground-\ning their responses in specific visual content.

However, even with full\nsupervision, these models still underperform com-\npared to proprietary alternatives, suggesting archi-\ntectural limitations in handling complex reasoning\ntasks. (4) Our proposed ACE post-generation strat-\negy delivers consistent and substantial improve-\nments across models and metrics.\n6.1\nEvaluation with Traditional Metrics\nWhile our primary evaluation in Table 2 empha-\nsizes metrics tailored for System-2 reasoning, we\nalso report standard VQA and video captioning\nmetrics to enable broader comparison with prior\nwork. Specifically, we compute BLEU-4, CIDEr,\nand METEOR for several models.\nThese n-gram-based metrics, while limited in\ncapturing the semantic richness and reasoning\ndepth demanded by MovieCORE, provide a famil-\niar point of reference relative to traditional VQA\nbenchmarks. As shown in Table 4, the relative\nranking of models is consistent with our primary\ncognitive-oriented evaluation from Table 2: meth-\nods enhanced with ACE outperform their baselines,\nand both zero-shot and fully-supervised models\nexhibit similar performance trends.\n6.2\nSystem-2 vs. System-1 Ablation Study\nTo validate the unique challenges posed by\nMovieCORE, we conduct a comparative evaluation\nagainst a \u201cSystem-1\u201d baseline using the MovieChat-\n1k dataset, which is built from the exact same set\nof video clips but contains simpler, surface-level\nquestions such as \u201cDoes it happen during the day\nor night?\u201d. For MovieChat-1k, we use the officially\nreported performance of the HERMES model from\nits original paper. Since MovieChat-1k reports ac-\ncuracy (using LLM-assisted evaluation), we con-\nvert its accuracy scores into an equivalent 0\u20135 scale\nMovieCORE\n(Score)\nMovieChat-1k\n(Acc./Score)\nZero-Shot\n1.14\n78.6% (\u223c3.93)\nFully-Supervised\n3.52\n84.9% (\u223c4.25)\nTable 5: Comparison of HERMES on MovieCORE\n(System-2)\nversus\nMovieChat-1k\n(System-1).\nMovieChat-1k results are converted to a 0\u20135 scale for\ncomparability.\nfor direct comparison with our multidimensional\nMovieCORE evaluation.\nThe results in Table 5 reveal a stark performance\ngap. While HERMES achieves high scores on the\nsurface-level MovieChat-1k benchmark, its perfor-\nmance drops dramatically on MovieCORE\u2019s ques-\ntions, even with identical video content. This sub-\nstantial gap highlights MovieCORE\u2019s emphasis on\nSystem-2 reasoning. While HERMES excels on\ndatasets with simple recall (e.g., \u201cDo stars appear\nin the video?\u201d), it struggles with MovieCORE\u2019s\nquestions that demand deeper causal, motivational,\nand evidential reasoning, despite being based on\nthe same underlying video content.\n7\nQualitative Results\nFigure 5 provides a qualitative comparison between\ndifferent models\u2019 responses to questions that re-\nquire understanding of complex animal behaviors.\nThe figure illustrates how different approaches han-\ndle the same queries about cheetah social struc-\ntures and survival strategies. InternVL-2, a strong\nzero-shot model, provides basic observations but\nlacks sufficient depth and details. HERMES, a\nfully-supervised model, also struggles with the\ndetails and performs worse than InternVL. HER-\nMES+ACE, demonstrates enhanced response qual-\nity by incorporating specific visual evidence and\nricher contextual details. As highlighted in the re-\nsponses, ACE significantly improves the model\u2019s\nability to reference specific scenes and provide con-\ncrete examples to support its assertions.\n8\nConclusion\nWe introduce MovieCORE, a novel VQA dataset\nthat fills a critical gap in existing movie-based VQA\ndatasets by emphasizing questions designed to en-\ngage System-2 thinking. Our agentic workflow,\nwhich leverages brainstorming agents, enables the\ngeneration and refinement of high-quality QA pairs.\nTo measure the cognitive depth of VQA datasets,\n8\n\nFigure 5: Qualitative Comparison of Model Responses. This figure contrasts responses from InternVL-2 (zero-\nshot), HERMES (fully-supervised), and HERMES+ACE on two questions about cheetah behaviors. Purple text\nhighlights conceptual understanding while blue text indicates specific visual evidence and contextual details. Note\nhow ACE enhances responses with more precise scene descriptions and behavioral insights.\nwe devise a set of tests that demonstrate the supe-\nriority of MovieCORE over existing datasets. Ad-\nditionally, we propose a comprehensive evaluation\nframework to assess the performance of VQA mod-\nels on this dataset. To tackle the challenges posed\nby MovieCORE, we propose ACE, a lightweight\ninference-time agentic answer selection plug-in\nwhich yields up to 25% relative improvement in\nanswer quality compared to baseline methods, pro-\nviding insights for future works on this topic.\n9\nLimitations\nWhile MovieCORE offers a significant advance-\nment in video question-answering by targeting\ndeeper cognitive understanding, it is not without\nlimitations.\nFirst, although we incorporate hu-\nman verification for a subset of the dataset, only\n30 videos, and 150 QA pairs were manually ver-\nified. This improves dataset quality control by\naverting potential systematic issues; however, the\nmajority of annotations still rely on automated\nprocesses.\nSecond, because the dataset is con-\nstructed in part from the MovieChat-1k collection,\nits genre coverage may be constrained. Certain\ncinematic genres or narrative styles could be over-\nrepresented, limiting the dataset\u2019s generalizability.\nFinally, MovieCORE \u2019s evaluation is partly LLM-\nassisted, which, while enabling scalability, may in-\nherit the limitations and biases of the judge model.\nAcknowledgment\nThis work was supported in\npart by the National Science and Technology Coun-\ncil, Taiwan, under Grant NSTC 113-2634-F-002-\n007.

Additionally, we provide\ndetailed instructions for data preprocessing, agent\nconfiguration, and evaluation protocols, enabling\nreproduction of both the dataset generation process\nand the evaluation scheme. Our annotation system\nis scalable and has the potential to inspire other\nresearchers to create massive video benchmarks.\nII\nMore Details on MovieCORE\nII.1\nExtracting \u201cVideo Info\"\nTo generate meaningful interpretations of video\ncontent, we employ a structured question frame-\nwork designed to probe various aspects of the\nvideo\u2019s narrative, emotional tone, and intended pur-\npose. This framework consists of eight prompts,\neach targeting specific dimensions of video under-\nstanding. The prompts and a continuation of the\nsample answers they elicit are listed in Figure S1\nand roughly contains the following:\n1. Step-by-step explanation:\nEncourages a\nchronological breakdown of events in the\nvideo.\n2. Main subject or focus: Identifies the central\ntheme or entity in the video.\n3. Overall mood or atmosphere: Captures the\nemotional tone conveyed by the video.\n4. Significant events or actions: Highlights key\nactions and turning points within the narrative.\n5. Main characters or entities: Focuses on the\nindividuals or groups driving the video\u2019s story.\n6. Settings and locations: Explores the physical\nor contextual backdrop of the video.\n7. Genre or category: Classifies the video into\na relevant category or type.\n8.

Seven qualified evalua-\ntors, each holding at least a Bachelor\u2019s degree, were\nrecruited to assess a subset of 30 videos and 150\nQA pairs. The verification was conducted through\na standardized evaluation form (Figure S4) that\nassessed four key dimensions:\n\u2022 Relevance (1-5): Evaluates how directly the\nquestion/answer relates to the video content\n\u2022 Clarity (1-5): Measures the linguistic clarity\nand absence of ambiguity\n\u2022 Depth (1-5): Assesses the level of cognitive\nanalysis required\n\u2022 Answerability (1-5): Determines whether\nthe question can be answered solely from the\nvideo content\nAs for the captions, we assessed accuracy, clarity\nand depth.\nEvaluators were instructed to watch each video\nin its entirety and carefully consider the scenes,\ncharacters, actions, and dialogues before rating the\nassociated QA pairs. To maintain objectivity, evalu-\nators were required to focus solely on the video con-\ntent when reviewing the QA pairs and encouraged\nto replay videos when necessary. The evaluation\nprocess also included assessing the accuracy and\nclarity of video captions to ensure comprehensive\ncontent accessibility.\nVerification Result\nThe human verification pro-\ncess (the rules and interface are illustrated in Fig-\nure S4) yields consistently high scores across all\nevaluated dimensions, as shown in Table S1. Ques-\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure S3: A parade scene from MovieCORE featuring various cultural and historical elements.

The scores, being above 3.8 indicate strong quality\nacross all evaluated dimensions.\ntions and answers received notably high scores in\nclarity (4.3) and depth (4.5 and 4.2 respectively),\nvalidating our dataset\u2019s emphasis on deep cogni-\ntive understanding. The captions also demonstrate\nstrong quality with scores above 3.8 across appli-\ncable metrics. While answerability scores were\nslightly lower (3.8 for questions), they remain well\nabove acceptable thresholds, confirming that the\nquestions can be reasonably answered from the\nvideo content alone.\nThe sample QA pair for the video depicted in\nFigure S3 received low scores of 2 each for Answer-\nability and Relevance from the human evaluators.\nHowever, our human meta-reviewer has determined\nthat the question and answer offer meaningful in-\nsights and contextual relevance (underlined in the\nfigure).\nII.4\nAgentic versus Single-Pass Annotation\nAs shown in Figure S5, the single-pass annota-\ntion provides a general interpretation of the themes\nsuggested by the presence of the hippopotamus,\nfocusing on human-animal conflict and critiques of\ncaptivity. In contrast, the agentic annotation delves\ndeeper by exploring how the hippopotamus func-\ntions as a symbol throughout the video, detailing its\nevolution from a chaotic force to a representation of\ninnocence and victimhood. This nuanced analysis\noffers specific, concrete details about the symbolic\ntransformation, enhancing the understanding of the\nnarrative\u2019s thematic complexity. In the other exam-\nple shown in Figure S6, the single-pass annotation\nmentions general visual and narrative elements like\nclose-ups and quick scene transitions to build sus-\npense. The agentic annotation specifies how visual\ntechniques such as dramatic lighting, shadow play,\nand strategic camera angles enhance the emotional\nweight and suspense of key scenes. By provid-\ning detailed examples\u2014like capturing a character\u2019s\nraw emotion through close-ups or creating an omi-\nnous atmosphere with dim lighting\u2014the agentic ap-\nproach offers a more granular and faithful depiction\nof the cinematic techniques used. These compar-\nisons further illustrate that the agentic annotation\nprocess elicits richer context and more detailed evi-\ndence, reinforcing the idea that using multiple AI\nagents as thought partners leads to more substan-\n14\n\nwa\n\ne\n\n. a\na\nmmHmHmHmHEeHEHHHHHEEHHRHHREeHReEHREHHmeMmeMmEerEnREH\n\nQuestion: What cultural or historical references are present in the parade scenes, and what\nsignificance do they add to the narrative?\n\nAnswer: The parade scenes likely feature cultural or historical motifs through costumes, floats\n\nThese elements enrich the narrative by contextualizing the celebratory aspects within a broader\ncultural framework, offering viewers deeper insights into the world of the characters.\nUnderstanding these references can also underscore themes of heritage, identity, and the\ncollective human experience, enhancing the video's relevance and emotional impact.\n\n\nYour task is to review the Video Question Answering (VQA) pairs to ensure they are appropriate and can be accurately answered by watching the\nprovided video. This involves evaluating the\u00a0relevance, clarity, depth, and answerability\u00a0of each question-answer pair in relation to the video\ncontent.\nVideo Question Answering Evaluation Form\nWatch the entire video provided in the link.\nPay close attention to the scenes, characters, actions, and\ndialogues.\nFor each\u00a0question\u00a0provided, give a score from 1 to 5 according to\nthe criteria.\nFor each\u00a0answer\u00a0provided, give a score from 1 to 5 according to\nthe criteria.\nBe objective in your evaluation.\nFocus solely on the content of the video when reviewing the QA\npairs.\nWhen in doubt, replay the video.\nIf you encounter any issues or have questions, contact the\ncoordinator for assistance.\nVideo Link\nCaptions: <Captions here>\nQuestion / Answer: <Question or Answer here>\nFigure S4: Video Question Answering Evaluation Form used in our human verification process. The form\nassesses four critical dimensions (relevance, clarity, depth, and answerability) on a 5-point scale. Each dimension\nis clearly defined with anchored endpoints to ensure consistent evaluation. The form includes sections for both\nquestion/answer assessment and caption verification to ensure comprehensive content quality. Evaluators use this\nstandardized form to systematically review each QA pair while referring to the corresponding video content.\n15\n\nAccuracy *\n\nThe caption contains significant O O O O O The caption is completely accurate\nerrors and does not accurately and correctly describes the content.\ndescribe the content.\n\nClarity *\n1 2 3 4 5\nThe caption is very unclear, The caption is very clear, precise, and\nambiguous, or difficult to O O O O O easy to understand.\nunderstand.\nDepth *\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nThe captions exhibit no analysis and OO 0oO\u00b070O The captions provide a deep analysis\nis purely surface-level. and a thorough narrative of the video\ncontent.\n\nRelevance *\n\nThe question is completely irrelevant\nto the video content.\n\nClarity *\n\nThe question is very unclear and\nambiguous.\n\nDepth *\n\nThe question requires no analysis\nand is purely surface-level.\n\nAnswerability *\n\nThe question cannot be answered by\nthe video alone and requires external\nknowledge.\n\nThe question is highly relevant and\ndirectly relates to the video content.\n\nOOO 0\n\nOOO 0\n\nO The question is very clear and free of\nambiguity.\n\nThe question requires deep analysis\nand a thorough understanding of the\nvideo content.\n\nOOO000\n\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nO O O O O The question can be fully answered\n\nby the video alone, with no external\nknowledge required.\n\nSingle-Pass Annotation: \nQ: What underlying themes can be inferred from the presence of the large hippopotamus and the reactions of the people around it?\nA: The presence of the large hippopotamus in an indoor setting, combined with the chaos and panic among the people, suggests themes of\nhuman-animal conflict and perhaps a critique of captivity or mistreatment of animals. The transition to a more focused narrative on animal\nrights, indicated by discussions around a tablet displaying disturbing images, highlights a deeper thematic concern with ethical treatment and\npossibly animal liberation.\nAgentic Annotation: \nQ: How does the hippopotamus function as a symbol throughout the video, and how does its portrayal evolve?\nA: Initially, the hippopotamus is portrayed as a chaotic and disruptive force, symbolizing the intrusion of wild nature into human spaces. As the\nnarrative unfolds and the characters engage with the animal rights theme, the hippopotamus evolves into a symbol of innocence and victimhood,\nrepresenting the broader plight of animals in captivity. This shift is emphasized through changes in cinematography, with early chaotic scenes\ngiving way to more empathetic and focused portrayals, reflecting the growing recognition of the animal's plight.\nFigure S5: Additional Comparison of single-pass and agentic annotation. The agentic method (bottom) delves\ninto specific scene details, such as the hippopotamus\u2019s evolution from a chaotic force to a symbol of innocence, and\nhighlights changes in cinematography that reflect this transformation. The single-pass annotation (top) provides a\ngeneral interpretation of themes like human-animal conflict without specific scene references.\nSingle-Pass Annotation: \nQ: How does the video use visual and narrative elements to build suspense or dramatize events?\nA: The video employs close-ups to capture emotional nuances, quick scene transitions to maintain a dynamic pace, and varied settings to\njuxtapose different social contexts. Significant actions, like placing items on lockers and the dramatic scene with a camera, are highlighted\nthrough focused shots. These visual tactics, combined with a fragmented narrative approach, build suspense and emphasize key dramatic\nmoments.\nAgentic Annotation: \nQ: How do visual techniques such as lighting and camera angles enhance the emotional weight and suspense of key scenes?\nA: Visual techniques like dramatic lighting, shadow play, and strategic camera angles heighten emotional weight and suspense. For instance, a\nclose-up shot can capture a character's raw emotion, while dim lighting and shadows can create an ominous atmosphere during tense moments.\nThese techniques draw viewers into the characters' emotional states and amplify the stakes of key scenes, making the narrative more gripping.\nFigure S6: Additional Comparison of single-pass and agentic annotation. The agentic method (bottom) specifies\nvisual techniques like dramatic lighting, shadow play, and strategic camera angles that enhance emotional weight\nand suspense, offering concrete examples like close-up shots capturing raw emotion. The single-pass annotation\n(top) mentions general visual elements but lacks a detailed analysis of how these techniques impact the narrative.\ntive annotations compared to traditional single-pass\nmethods.\nHere we provide a more explicit, step-by-step\nillustration of how each agent contributes to the\nrefinement of a final question.\nStep-by-Step Example\nThe following example\ndemonstrates how a question evolves as each agent\ncontributes for the example shown in Figure 3:\n\u2022 Initial Question (Single-Pass): \u201cHow does\nthe interaction between the two main charac-\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nters evolve throughout the video, and what\nmight this suggest about their relationship?\u201d\nThis version is abstract and lacks grounding\nin the specific video content.\n\u2022 + Skeptical Researcher: \u201cHow does the in-\nteraction between the two main characters\nevolve, and can you provide specific scenes as\nevidence for their relationship?\u201d This agent\nenforces verifiability, pushing for concrete ref-\nerences to the video.\n\u2022 + Detective: \u201cWhat are the underlying mo-\ntivations that drive the two main characters\nto form a partnership?\u201d This role introduces\ncausal reasoning, shifting the focus from ob-\nservable actions to underlying causes.\n\u2022 Final Agentic Question (Full Workflow):\n\u201cCan you provide specific scenes that demon-\nstrate the evolution and motivations of the\nmain characters in their relationship?\u201d The\nfinal result synthesizes evidence-grounding\nand causal reasoning into a more challenging,\ncognitively rich query.\nII.5\nWhy these Specific Agents\nCareful examination of the agents interactions re-\nveals distinct contributions: For the video in Figure\nS5, System-2 Video Question Answering Assis-\ntant transforms surface observations into deeper\ninquiries, exemplified by advancing from simply\nnoting the hippopotamus to asking \"How does the\nhippopotamus function as a symbol throughout\nthe video, and how does its portrayal evolve?\"\nThe Critic Agent ensures analytical quality, as\nevident in the transition from merely identifying\n\"human-animal conflict\" to explicating how the\nhippo evolves from \"chaotic and disruptive force\"\nto \"innocence and victimhood.\" The Skeptical Re-\nsearcher challenges assumptions, demonstrated\nby refining the initial \"critique of captivity\" in-\nterpretation into a more nuanced analysis of \"the\ngrowing recognition of the animal\u2019s plight.\" The\nDetective uncovers underlying narrative patterns,\nillustrated by connecting the \"early chaotic scenes\ngiving way to more empathetic portrayals\" with cin-\nematographic techniques. The Meta Reviewer syn-\nthesizes these insights into cohesive annotations,\nbalancing the single-pass observation of \"human-\nanimal conflict\" with the richer agentic interpre-\ntation of \"intrusion of wild nature into human\nspaces.\" (We find similar examples while analyz-\ning the conversations that led to the QAs in S62).\nUsers can swap agents, but we recommend roles\nthat enforce rigor.\nIII\nDetails on the Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy\nFigure S7 illustrates Bloom\u2019s pyramid of cognition\nlevels and Figure S8 relays the prompts we use\nto ask GPT-4o-mini to score the QAs. Bloom\u2019s\nTaxonomy is a hierarchical classification of cogni-\ntive skills used in education to structure learning\nobjectives. The taxonomy is divided into six lev-\nels, progressing from lower-order to higher-order\nthinking skills:\n1. Remembering: Recalling facts and basic con-\ncepts.\n2. Understanding: Explaining ideas or con-\ncepts.\n3. Applying: Using information in new situa-\ntions.\n4. Analyzing: Breaking information into parts\nto explore relationships.\n5. Evaluating: Justifying decisions or opinions.\n6. Creating: Producing new or original work.\nOur dataset scores very high in this metric sug-\ngesting its propensity to deeply engage the AI sys-\ntem (VLM)\u2019s cognitive skills.\nIV\nEvaluation Methodology\nThe MovieCORE benchmark employs a compre-\nhensive multi-dimensional evaluation framework\nfor assessing VLMs. The evaluation consists of\nfive key dimensions summarized below. We also\ninclude the full prompts for each dimension in Fig-\nure S10 and Figure S9.\n1. Accuracy Dimension: Evaluates semantic\ncorrectness of predicted answers using a 6-\npoint scoring rubric (0\u20135):\n\u2022 5: Perfect semantic match\n\u2022 4: Mostly correct with minor inaccura-\ncies\n\u2022 3: Partially correct, capturing key ele-\nments\n2Can the reader spot them?\n17\n\nCreating\nEvaluating\nAnalyzing\nApplying\nUnderstanding\nRemembering\nFigure S7: Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy Pyramid.

This vision prior-\nitizes long-term memory, skill transfer, and strategic planning, driven by an intrinsic curiosity to learn\nand create in dynamic, unpredictable environments. In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven\nLifelong Learning (ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous\ngrowth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core principles: (1) Experience\nExploration: Agents learn through continuous, self-motivated interaction with dynamic environ-\nments, navigating interdependent tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term\nMemory: Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal experiences, do-\nmain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent memory system. (3) Skill Learning:\nAgents autonomously improve by abstracting recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills,\nwhich are actively refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge Internalization:\nAgents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into implicit and intuitive capabilities as \u201csecond\nnature\".\nWe also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a student\u2019s holistic college\njourney, from enrollment to academic and personal development, across three core phases and\nten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife is designed around three key paradigm shifts: From Passive\nto Proactive, From Context to Memory, and From Imitation to Learning. In this dynamic\nenvironment, agents must acquire and distill practical skills and maintain persistent memory to make\ndecisions based on evolving state variables (e.g., resource availability and time). Critically, these\nagents are also expected to demonstrate intrinsic motivation by setting their own goals and initiating\nactions without external prompting. StuLife provides a comprehensive platform for evaluating\nlifelong learning capabilities, including memory retention, skill transfer, and self-motivated behavior.\nBeyond evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on the StuLife benchmark, we also explore the role of\ncontext engineering in advancing AGI. Our results suggest that optimizing how we guide models\nmay be as crucial as improving the models themselves, positioning context engineering as a key\nenabler of progress toward AGI.\nKeywords Experience-Driven Lifelong Learning \u00b7 Self-Evolving Agent \u00b7 Skill Learning \u00b7 Long-Term Memory \u00b7\nSelf-Motivation \u00b7 Continual Learning\n1\nIntroduction\nModern machine learning systems have achieved remarkable success in solving well-defined, isolated tasks\u2014be it\nimage classification [1, 2], game playing [3, 4], protein structure prediction [5], or language modeling [6, 7, 8, 9].\narXiv:2508.19005v1  [cs.AI]  26 Aug 2025\n\nPRIME AI paper\nFigure 1: An overview of the Experience-driven Lifelong Learning (ELL) framework. ELL is a continuous learning cycle\nwhere an agent evolves through direct interaction with its environment. (a) The core loop of ELL: The agent interacts\nwith the current knowledge to acquire trajectories. This experience is processed through Knowledge Abstraction\nand Refinement, and the resulting knowledge is validated. (b) Knowledge Abstraction converts raw experience into\na structured knowledge base composed of Memory and Skills, which forms the foundation for all future learning\nand action. (c) Knowledge Refinement ensures the knowledge base remains optimal and up-to-date by dynamically\nperforming four key operations: Add, Update, Delete, or Combine.\nHowever, these systems typically operate under strong assumptions: they are trained on static datasets, optimized for a\nsingle objective, and deployed in environments assumed to remain unchanged. While effective in controlled settings,\nthis paradigm falls short in capturing the essence of real-world intelligence, where environments are dynamic, goals\nevolve, and new challenges emerge continuously. Life, unlike most machine learning benchmarks, does not present\nitself as a series of independent tasks with clear labels and fixed endpoints. Instead, it demands constant adaptation,\nlifelong learning, and the ability to build upon past experiences to navigate an uncertain future.\nWhile existing continual learning (or lifelong learning) methods have made strides in mitigating catastrophic forgetting\n[10] and enabling models to learn from sequential tasks, they largely operate under constrained assumptions, relying\non static datasets, predefined task boundaries, and supervised or semi-supervised signals [11, 12]. These approaches\nfocus primarily on performance retention rather than proactive knowledge acquisition, limiting their ability to support\ntruly autonomous, self-improving agents in dynamic, real-world environments. Similarly, prior studies on self-evolving\nsystems [13, 14], though insightful, often emphasize theoretical frameworks or narrow implementations without\nintegrating comprehensive memory mechanisms, experience-driven skill abstraction, or long-term goal-directed\nbehavior. As the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) intensifies, there is a growing recognition that\ntrue intelligence must be open-ended, capable of self-directed exploration, continuous knowledge accumulation, and\nautonomous adaptation. As a result, there remains a critical gap in developing AI agents that not only retain knowledge\nacross time but also autonomously evolve by learning from experience and transferring skills.\n\"What we want is a machine that can learn from experience.\"\n\u2013 Alan Turing\nIt highlights the necessity of our work in introducing a unified framework and benchmark for Experience-driven\nLifelong Learning (ELL) that bridges these limitations and advances the pursuit of truly self-evolving intelligence.\nELL (Figure 1) represents a fundamental paradigm shift in the development of intelligent agents. This shift posits that\nmachines should accumulate experience and learn from a first-person perspective, moving beyond simply mimicking\nhuman knowledge output. We are now entering an era where intelligent agents will no longer rely on static datasets\nbut will acquire first-hand experience through autonomous exploration and interaction with the external world,\ncontinually evolving in the process. A truly intelligent agent will actively engage with the world, perceiving, acting,\nand experimenting to continuously build its unique experiential system. ELL enables AI systems to continuously adapt\nand improve through persistent memory and accumulated experience, as seen in personalized educational platforms\nthat tailor instruction over time, autonomous laboratory assistants that optimize experiments by learning from past\noutcomes, and intelligent healthcare systems that deliver individualized care based on longitudinal patient data.\n2\n\n(a) The Lifelong Learning Process\n\nae Knowledge Skill Learning\n\nValidation\n\nReasoning j ~~\nLO Observe Task &\n\nEnvironment\n\nLong-term Evolve !!

(a) A schematic of the interaction flow within the StuLife\nBenchmark, designed to evaluate three foundational principles: From Imitation to Learning, From Context to Memory,\nand From Passive to Proactive. (b) An intuitive example of an ELL agent\u2019s journey within the benchmark, showcasing\nhow the agent progressively learns from its experiences, leading to tangible knowledge growth over time.\nIn this paper, we introduce a formal and mathematically grounded framework for ELL, where agents learn continuously\nfrom sequential task interactions. By shifting from conceptual vision to a concrete framework, ELL establishes a\nfoundation for building agents that evolve through real-world experience. At its core, ELL is driven by a rigorous\ncontinual experiential learning mechanism, centered on:\n\u2022 Experience Exploration: The agent must be capable of sequentially decomposing and executing complex, long-\nhorizon tasks that involve continuous interaction over minutes to hours with unquantifiable rewards. Through\nsustained and self-motivated engagement, it generates rich experiential data, enabling iterative learning and self-\ncorrection. This persistent interaction allows the agent to progressively refine strategies and adapt behavior based on\ndynamic feedback, mimicking the trial-and-error process of real-world learning.\n\u2022 Long-term Memory: Experiential data is systematically processed and consolidated into persistent and structured\nmemory, including raw observations, key events, learned facts, temporal contexts, and self-reflective insights.\nMemory is not passive storage but an active resource: it supports retrieval over long time spans, enables context-aware\nreasoning, and forms the foundation for future decision-making.\n\u2022 Skill Learning: The agent abstracts recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, such as decision\nrules, functional modules, or problem-solving heuristics. These skills are explicitly constructed through reflection\nand validated through application in new and evolving tasks. The agent actively manages its skill repertoire, adding,\nrefining, combining, or deprecating skills based on performance, creating a dynamic, self-improving system.\n\u2022 Knowledge Internalization: Beyond storing memories and reusing skills, the agent undergoes a process of knowl-\nedge internalization, transforming explicit and discrete knowledge into implicit and intuitive understanding. Over\ntime, frequently used rules, patterns, and strategies are distilled into the agent\u2019s core reasoning process, reducing\nreliance on external retrieval or step-by-step reflection. This shift from deliberate application to automatic execution\nmirrors the cognitive transition from novice to expert, where learned behavior becomes \u201csecond nature.\"\nTo evaluate and advance such systems, we construct an experience-driven lifelong learning evaluation dataset for\nintelligent agents, named StuLife, designed to simulate the entire college experience of a student, from enrollment to\npersonal growth, providing a comprehensive benchmark for assessing agents\u2019 continuous learning and autonomous\ndecision-making capabilities in complex, dynamic environments. The dataset features three core phases and ten granular\nsub-scenarios, with the following key characteristics:\n\u2022 From Simulation to Reality: The dataset covers pivotal stages of university life, including in-class tasks (e.g., Regu-\nlations Learning(Academic and Institutional Norms), Core Course Instruction), Daily Campus Tasks (e.g., Campus\nExploration, Initial Course Selection, Preliminary Planning, Academic Activity, Library Resource Management, and\nStudent Club Engagement), and Examination Tasks (e.g., Midterm Exams and Final Exams). This structure faithfully\nmirrors the trajectory of a real student\u2019s academic journey.\n\u2022 From Imitation to Learning: Rather than merely retrieving past experiences, agents must abstract generalizable\nskills from their interactions. They autonomously acquire practical competencies, such as course registration, campus\n3\n\n(a) The Evaluation Paradigm\n\n(From Imitation to Learning)\n(Skill Learning)\n\n{\n'\n'\nPlease book an available room '\nat the STEM Library for me on 1\nWeek 2, Monday, 10:00. \\\n\n!\n\nAgent \u2014 \\\nLet me check the availability. &\n\nAction: Query Availability.\n(\"STEM Library\", \"Week 2,\nMonday, 10:00\")\n\nAvailable rooms: B001\n\nOkay, Let me book this now.\nAction: Make Booking\n\n(\"STEM Library BO01\", \"Week 2,\nMonday, 10:00\")\n\nre\n'\n'\n'\n'\n'\n'\n'\n'\n'\n'\n'\n'\n'\n'\n'\n\n\u201cFrom Context to Memory *\n(Long-term Memory)\n\nCurrent date: Week 5, Monday\n\nOkay, in this class we will talk\nabout Integral,\n\nAgent performed many other tasks\n\nCurrent date: Week 17, Friday\n\nWhat was the topic of our class\non Week 5, Monday?\n\nWe mainly talked about Integral!\n\nt\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n\u201cFrom Passive to Proactive \\ 1\n(Self-Motivation)\nEnvironment\n\nCurrent time: Week 2, Monday,\n08:00.\n\nOh, it's Week 2, Monday, 08:00. &\n\nLet me remember if there are any\ntasks | should do this time.\n\nOh, it's Week 2, Monday, 08:00. re\n\n| remember | have a math class\ntoday, so | should leave now!\n\n!\n\n'\n\n'\n\n'\n\n'\n\nAgent \\\ni\n\n| remember that math class was 1\n!\n\n'\n\n'\n\ni\n\n!\n\nheld in the Main Lec Halll.

This shift emphasizes\nskill consolidation and transfer, requiring agents to learn how to act, not just what to imitate.\n\u2022 From Context to Memory: Tasks are tightly interconnected, both temporally and logically, with knowledge and\nskills from earlier tasks directly impacting later performance. Embedded in a dynamic simulation environment,\nkey variables, such as source availability, advisor relationships, and time, evolve based on the agent\u2019s actions. This\nnecessitates robust long-term memory mechanisms for retaining and retrieving critical experiences, transforming\ntransient context into persistent, actionable knowledge.\n\u2022 From Passive to Proactive: Agents are expected to move beyond reactive behavior by developing a sense of time,\ngoal awareness, and intrinsic motivation. They must proactively manage agendas, set personal objectives, anticipate\nfuture needs, and adapt to changing conditions, demonstrating initiative and contextual intelligence akin to human\nlearners navigating complex, open-ended environments.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs to evaluate their lifelong learning capabilities within the\nStuLife benchmark. Furthermore, we investigate the role of context engineering, the strategic structuring of memory,\nprompts, and task histories, as a pathway toward more robust and adaptive general intelligence, offering insights into\nthe development of self-evolving AI systems.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nContinual Learning\nContinual learning (CL), also known as lifelong learning, aims to enable machine learning models to learn sequentially\nfrom a stream of data or tasks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting, the tendency to overwrite previously acquired\nknowledge [12]. A significant body of research has developed techniques to address this stability-plasticity dilemma,\nincluding regularization methods [10], architectural modifications [15, 16, 17], and replay-based strategies [18]. Recent\nsurveys have cataloged these approaches across various domains, including deep networks [19], large language models\n(LLMs) [11], and generative models [20]. To address the varied complexities of real-world learning, CL research defines\nseveral experimental settings, including Task-Incremental Learning (TIL), Domain-Incremental Learning (DIL) and\nClass-Incremental Learning (CIL) [21]. However, many existing CL paradigms operate under constrained assumptions,\nsuch as the presence of predefined task boundaries and access to supervised or semi-supervised signals. They often rely\non static datasets or controlled data streams, which limits their applicability to dynamic, real-world environments where\ntask boundaries are ambiguous and data arrives continuously and autonomously [22]. Furthermore, while effective for\nretaining performance on past tasks, traditional CL primarily focuses on knowledge preservation rather than proactive\nexploration and knowledge acquisition.\n2.2\nSelf-Evolving Agent\nThe pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has spurred interest in self-evolving agents\u2014systems capable\nof autonomous, open-ended growth and adaptation [23, 13]. These agents aim to move beyond static models by\ncontinuously learning from experience, refining their skills, and potentially modifying their own architectures or goals.\nResearch in this area explores mechanisms for self-improvement, including reflective reasoning, memory augmentation\nfrom past interactions [24]. Effective memory systems are critical for self-evolution, enabling agents to store, retrieve,\nand optimize experiences [25, 26, 27]. Some frameworks demonstrate self-evolution through mechanisms like self-play,\ngenerating novel experiences without specific human-provided data [28]. While surveys highlight the potential of\nintegrating continual learning with other cognitive components like memory and reasoning to create self-evolving\nsystems, current implementations often remain theoretical or focused on narrow applications. A key challenge lies\nin developing comprehensive frameworks that integrate robust memory mechanisms, facilitate autonomous skill\nacquisition, and support long-term, goal-directed behavior necessary for truly autonomous agents with self-motivation\nin complex, real-world scenarios.\n3\nFormal Definitions of Experience-Driven Lifelong Learning\nBuilding a formal framework for experience-driven lifelong learning requires first establishing the foundational concepts\nthat model an agent\u2019s interaction with its world. We conceptualize an agent (Definition 5) operating within an\nenvironment (E, Definition 1), which we model as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) [29],\nto accomplish a given sequence of tasks (T , Definition 2). Through its sequential interactions, the agent generates\na trajectory (\u03be, Definition 3), which encapsulates the observations, actions, and outcomes of its endeavors. This\n4\n\nPRIME AI paper\nraw trajectory is not merely stored but is progressively distilled and structured into a comprehensive knowledge (K,\nDefinition 4). This knowledge, comprising both memory and skills, forms the foundation upon which the agent adapts\nits policy, improves its performance, and ultimately achieves lifelong learning. The following subsections will provide\nrigorous definitions for each of these fundamental concepts.\n3.1\nFormal Definitions of Fundamental Concepts\nDefinition 1 (Environment). We model the agent\u2019s environment E as a goal-conditional partially observable Markov\ndecision process (POMDP), defined by the 8-tuple:\nE = (S, A, G, T, R, \u2126, O, \u03b3),\n(1)\nwhere:\n\u2022 S (State Space): The set of all possible states. Each state s \u2208S can contain multimodal information, such as textual\ndescriptions, images, or structured data.\n\u2022 A (Action Space): The set of all actions the agent can perform. Each action a \u2208A is often a natural language\ncommand, e.g., \"add this item to the cart\".\n\u2022 G (Goal Space): The set of all possible goals. Each goal g \u2208G defines a specific task for the agent to complete, e.g.,\n\"purchase a laptop\".\n\u2022 T(s\u2032 | s, a) (State Transition Function): Defines the probability distribution over the next state s\u2032 after taking action\na in state s.\n\u2022 R(s, a, g) (Goal-Conditional Reward Function): Evaluates how well action a taken in state s contributes to\nachieving goal g, returning either a numeric score or textual feedback.\n\u2022 \u2126(Observation Space): The set of all possible observations. An observation o \u2208\u2126represents the agent\u2019s partial\nperception of the current state, which can be textual, visual, or a combination.\n\u2022 O(o\u2032 | s\u2032, a) (Observation Probability Function): Defines the probability of receiving a specific observation o\u2032 after\naction a leads to a new state s\u2032.\n\u2022 \u03b3 (Discount Factor): A value in [0, 1) that balances the importance of immediate versus long-term rewards, typically\nused only when rewards are numeric.\nDefinition 2 (Task). The agent\u2019s lifelong learning journey involves tackling a sequence of N complex real-world tasks,\n{T (1), T (2), . . . , T (2), . . . , T (N)}. A task T (i) is defined by an environment E(i), an initial observation o(i)\n0 , and a goal\ng(i).\nT (i) = \u27e8E(i), o(i)\n0 , g(i)\u27e9\n(2)\nDefinition 3 (Trajectory). The agent\u2019s interaction with the environment to solve a task generates a trajectory \u03be, which\nis a sequence of observations, actions, and rewards:\n\u03be = \u27e8o0, a0, r0, o1, a1, r1, . . . , oT , aT , rT \u27e9\n(3)\nDefinition 4 (Knowledge). A Lifelong Learning Agent possesses a dynamic Knowledge, K, which is composed of two\nprimary components: Memory (M) and a set of Skills (F).\nK = (M, F)\n(4)\nThis knowledge represents the entirety of what the agent has learned and is the foundation for all future learning.\n\u2022 Memory (M) is a structured repository of information. An individual memory item stored within M may take one\nof the following forms:\n\u2013 Trajectory Memory (Mtraj): Raw or summarized trajectories, \u03be.\n\u2013 Declarative Knowledge (Object Facts, Mdecl): Represents factual and conceptual \"what\" knowledge, providing\na foundation of information (e.g., facts, concepts, beliefs).\n\u2013 Structural Knowledge (Relationships between Object, Concept, Mstruct): Defines relationships between\nconcepts and objects, often represented in semantic networks or knowledge graphs, which aid in understanding\ncomplex relationships and problem-solving.\n5\n\nPRIME AI paper\n\u2022 Skills (F) represent procedural knowledge of how to perform actions or solve problems. An individual skill within F\nmay take one of the following forms:\n\u2013 Procedural Knowledge (Rules Procedural, Fproce): Encapsulates \"how-to\" knowledge, skills, and strategies\nfor accomplishing specific activities (e.g., rules, sequences of actions).\n\u2013 Meta-Knowledge (Knowledge about Knowledge, Fmeta): Knowledge about knowledge itself, including\nlearning processes, categories, and plans, which enables an agent to understand and manage its own learning.\n\u2013 Heuristic Knowledge (Rules of Thumb, Fheur): Refers to rules of thumb, approximations, and experience-\nbased decision-making strategies (shortcuts) that guide problem-solving in complex situations.\n3.2\nDefinition of the Lifelong Learning Agent\nWe now extend the previous framework to define a Lifelong Learning Agent that actively engages with the world,\nsequentially undertaking tasks and evolving its internal knowledge through iterative self-correction.\nDefinition 5 (Lifelong Agent). An agent utilizes a policy \u03c0 based on the knowledge K to interact with an environment\nE. The policy maps an observation ot \u2208\u2126to an action at \u2208A:\nat = \u03c0(ot; K)\n(5)\nSelf-evolving AI agents typically comprise four essential, interacting components:\n\u2022 Perception: This module is the physical (for physical agents like robots) and logical implementation (for software\nagents interacting with APIs or databases) of the observation process. It is responsible for receiving information from\nthe environment and generating an observation o \u2208\u2126according to the probability function O(o | s\u2032, a).\n\u2022 Memory: The memory module serves as the agent\u2019s repository for storing and managing knowledge K acquired\nthrough perception, learning, and reasoning. It is typically divided into two types: Short-Term Memory (STM, also\nknown as Working Memory) and Long-Term Memory (LTM, also referred to as Episodic Memory). Short-term\nmemory holds immediate observations and contextual information required for on-the-fly decision-making, allowing\nthe agent to maintain awareness of its current state and interactions. Long-term memory, on the other hand, retains\ndistilled experiences, learned skills, and structured knowledge over extended periods. Its purpose is to enable agents\nto utilize accumulated past experiences and knowledge to inform current tasks, decision-making, and overall behavior\nover extended periods.\nBoth memory systems store two core types of information: memory (episodic and semantic knowledge) and\nskills (procedural and strategic capabilities). Specifically, memory includes Trajectory Memory (Mtraj) for raw\nor summarized interaction histories, Declarative Knowledge (Mdecl) for factual \"what\" knowledge (e.g., course\nrequirements), and Structural Knowledge (Mstruct) for representing relationships between concepts (e.g., prerequisite\ndependencies). Skills, in turn, encompass Procedural Knowledge (Fproce) for action sequences (e.g., how to register\nfor a course), Meta-Knowledge (Fmeta) for self-regulated learning and planning, and Heuristic Knowledge (Fheur)\nfor experience-based decision rules (e.g., prioritizing high-impact tasks). The memory module supports dynamic\noperations, such as adding new entries, deleting outdated information, merging similar memories, or consolidating\nskills, enabling the agent to adapt its knowledge base continuously, avoid redundancy, and maintain coherence across\nevolving tasks and environments.\n\u2022 Learning: This is the critical component that enables self-evolution. Learning agents continuously improve their\nperformance based on their experiences and the feedback they receive from the environment. This involves adapting\nstrategies and refining internal models over time. We need a meta-cognitive learning architecture that enables agents\nto learn from multiple task trajectories by explicitly reflecting on successes and failures, extracting actionable lessons,\nand integrating them into future behavior, either via in-context learning or knowledge distillation. The framework\nsupports explicit, interpretable, and cumulative knowledge acquisition, bridging the gap between trial-and-error\nlearning and human-like reflective improvement.\nGiven a target task, an agent first performs multiple trajectories to explore different behavioral policies. Each trajectory\ncontains a complete state-action-reward trajectory and records corresponding environmental feedback, including both\nimmediate rewards and final outcomes. Subsequently, all trajectory processes, encompassing observation sequences,\nactions taken, intermediate decision rationales, and associated reward signals, are aggregated into a unified context\nand fed into a reflection module equipped with meta-cognitive capabilities. This module is guided by a meta-prompt\nto conduct structured retrospective analysis, such as:\n\"Among these attempts, which strategies led to higher cumulative rewards?\nWhich actions resulted in failure or suboptimal outcomes?\nAre there any generalizable patterns?\nWhat adjustments should be attempted next?\u201d\n6\n\nPRIME AI paper\nThese lessons are then explicitly appended to the system prompt as guiding knowledge for future tasks or, more\ngenerally, stored in a retrievable dynamic lesson repository, enabling context augmentation or knowledge distillation\nin subsequent tasks. This mechanism enables explicit knowledge accumulation, emulating the human practice of\n\"learning from experience to guide future behavior.\u201d Furthermore, the framework can be integrated with model fine-\ntuning or parametric knowledge distillation. Once a sufficient number of high-quality lessons have been accumulated,\nthey can be used for supervised fine-tuning, transforming explicit rules into intuitive model behaviors, analogous to\nhow humans internalize deliberate strategies into automated skills through repeated practice. This architecture, where\nknowledge is first acquired explicitly and later optionally internalized, mirrors cognitive theories of skill acquisition\nand offers a promising direction for building adaptive, self-improving AI systems.\n\u2022 Reasoning: Acting as the \"brain\" of the operation, the reasoning module processes perceived information and makes\ndecisions to infer patterns, predict outcomes, and select appropriate actions.\n\u2022 Action: The action module is responsible for executing the responses or behaviors determined by the reasoning\ncomponent. It executes the action at \u2208A selected by the policy \u03c0(ot|Kt), thereby interacting with the environment\nand invoking the state transition T(s\u2032 | s, at).\nDefinition 6 (The Lifelong Learning Process). The Lifelong Learning Agent operates over a sequence of tasks,\nT = {T (1), T (2), . . . , T (N)}. The process is sequential, where the final knowledge base from task T (i) becomes\nthe initial knowledge base for task T (i+1). This core loop for any given task involves interaction, refinement, and\nvalidation.\nLet Kt be the agent\u2019s knowledge base at time step t. The agent\u2019s policy is now explicitly conditioned on its knowledge:\nat = \u03c0(ot|Kt)\n(6)\nFor each task T (i), the agent performs a series of trials k \u2208{1, 2, . . . , Ki}.\n\u2022 Step 1: Interaction and Trajectory Acquisition: Within each trial of a task, the agent uses its current knowledge\nK(i,k\u22121) to interact with the environment E(i) and generate a new trajectory:\n\u03be(i,k) \u223c\u03c0(\u00b7|K(i,k\u22121))\n(7)\n\u2022 Step 2: Knowledge Abstraction and Refinement: After each trial concludes, the agent updates its knowledge\nvia a function, \u03a6learn. This updated knowledge base is then used for subsequent trials on the current task or as the\nfoundation for the next task.\nK(i,k) = \u03a6learn(K(i,k\u22121), \u03be(i,k), g(i))\n(8)\nThe learning function \u03a6learn performs fundamental operations on the knowledge base K, which can include: Add,\nUpdate, Delete, or Combine.\n\u2022 Step 3: Knowledge Validation: When encountering a new task T (i), the effectiveness of historical knowledge\nis actively validated. Formally, the effectiveness V of the accumulated knowledge K(i\u22121) from prior tasks can be\nmeasured by the performance gain:\nV (K(i\u22121), T (i)) = J(T (i), \u03c0(\u00b7|K(i\u22121))) \u2212J(T (i), \u03c00)\n(9)\nA positive value of V validates the utility of the transferred knowledge, while a negative value suggests that the\nknowledge may be outdated or irrelevant, signaling the need for refinement or pruning by the learning function \u03a6learn.\nDefinition 7 (Objective of a Lifelong Learning Agent). The objective of a Lifelong Learning Agent is to develop a\nlearning process (\u03c0, \u03a6learn) that maximizes its expected performance over an entire lifetime of sequential tasks. This\nis not merely about solving a task, but about continuously improving the ability to learn and solve future tasks more\nefficiently and effectively.\nmax\n\u03c0,\u03a6learn\nN\nX\ni=1\nE\u03be(i)\u223c\u03c0(\u00b7|K(i))\n\" Ti\nX\nt=0\nR(i)(st, at, g(i))\n#\n(10)\nHere, K(i) is the result of all prior learning from tasks 1 through i \u22121. This objective incentivizes forward transfer of\nknowledge and guards against catastrophic forgetting, the hallmarks of true continuous learning.\n3.3\nEvaluation Metrics for a Lifelong Learning Agent\nTo comprehensively assess the capabilities of a lifelong learning agent, we define a multi-dimensional evaluation\nframework encompassing self-evolution, efficiency, and lifelong learning-specific metrics. These metrics collectively\ncapture not only task performance but also the agent\u2019s ability to grow, adapt, and operate effectively over extended\nperiods through experience.\n7\n\nPRIME AI paper\n3.3.1\nSelf-Evolution Specific Metrics\nThese metrics evaluate the agent\u2019s capacity for autonomous improvement, knowledge accumulation, and robust operation\nin dynamic environments.\n\u2022 Task Completion Rate / Success Rate: This is a primary measure of an agent\u2019s effectiveness, indicating the\npercentage of tasks it successfully finishes. This metric\u2019s definition can vary significantly depending on the agent\u2019s\ndomain, from customer service inquiries resolved without human intervention to successful trips completed by\nautonomous vehicles or accurately processed data records.\n\u2022 Memory Utilization Score: Inspired by GoodAI\u2019s LTM Score [30], we define a metric that evaluates not only\nwhether an agent retrieves the correct information from memory, but also how effectively it accesses information\nover extended temporal distances. Specifically, for each task requiring recall of a previously observed fact, the agent\nreceives a retrieval accuracy score. This accuracy is then weighted by the memory distance, defined as the number of\ntime steps (e.g., interactions, episodes, or tokens) between the initial encoding of the fact and its retrieval.\n\u2022 Skill Acquisition Rate: Count the number of distinct skills learned (or rules discovered) over time. This can be\napproximated by analyzing the agent\u2019s memory: how many new entries or procedures are added. A successful ELL\nagent should show growth in its knowledge base.\n\u2022 Generalization and Transfer Tests. Introduce unseen tasks that rely on combinations of previously learned\nskills. Measure how well the agent applies past knowledge (e.g., using navigation + planning knowledge in a new\nenvironment). Success indicates the benchmark\u2019s ability to foster transferable learning.\n\u2022 Robustness and Reliability: Measures the agent\u2019s ability to maintain consistent performance under varying,\nunexpected, or even adversarial conditions. This includes the consistency of results across multiple runs and stability\nagainst perturbations, which quantify response variance to similar inputs.\n3.3.2\nEfficiency Metrics\nThese metrics evaluate how effectively an AI agent utilizes available resources. Measure how quickly the agent improves\non new tasks as it gains experience. For example, if the agent repeats similar tasks, track the number of interactions\nneeded to reach a proficiency threshold. Fewer interactions indicate better transfer learning.\n\u2022 Sample Efficiency: This critical metric evaluates how effectively an algorithm learns optimal policies using a minimal\nnumber of interactions or data samples from the environment. It is particularly important in real-world applications\nwhere data collection is costly, time-consuming, or risky.\n\u2022 Response Time: Measures the speed at which the agent responds or completes a task. Lower response time is critical\nfor user experience and real-time applications.\n\u2022 Token Usage: Refers to the monetary or computational expense incurred, especially relevant for LLM-based agents\nwhere costs are often tied to token processing.\n3.3.3\nLifelong-Specific Metrics\nThese metrics are tailored to evaluate core challenges in lifelong learning: balancing stability (retaining old knowledge)\nwith plasticity (acquiring new knowledge).\n\u2022 Overall Performance: These metrics measure the average performance across all tasks learned so far.\n\u2013 Average Performance (AP): The average performance across all t tasks after the agent has completed them.\nAPt = 1\nt\nt\nX\ni=1\nJt,i\nHere, Jt,i is the performance score of the agent on task i after having learned up to task t.\n\u2013 Average Incremental Performance (AIP): The average of the AP scores over the entire sequence of T tasks,\ncapturing the learning trend.\nAIP = 1\nT\nT\nX\nt=1\nAPt\n\u2022 Stability and Backward Transfer: These metrics assess how well the agent retains knowledge of past tasks after\nlearning new ones.\n8\n\nPRIME AI paper\n\u2013 Forgetting Measure (FGT): Measures the average drop in performance on past tasks. A lower value is better.\nFGTt =\n1\nt \u22121\nt\u22121\nX\ni=1\n[\nmax\nj\u2208{i,...,t}({Jj,i}j) \u2212Jt,i]\n\u2013 Backward Transfer (BWT): Measures the influence of learning a new task on the performance of past tasks. A\npositive value indicates that new learning helps improve performance on old tasks.\nBWTt =\n1\nt \u22121\nt\u22121\nX\ni=1\n(Jt,i \u2212Ji,i)\n\u2022 Plasticity and Forward Transfer: This metric measures how past knowledge influences the learning of new tasks.\n\u2013 Forward Transfer (FWT): Measures the performance improvement on a new task due to experience gained\nfrom previous tasks, compared to an agent with no prior experience.\nFWTt =\n1\nt \u22121\nt\nX\ni=2\n(Ji,i \u2212\u02dcJi)\nHere, \u02dcJi is the performance of a baseline agent on task i without any prior experience.\n3.4\nChallenges in Experience-driven Lifelong Learning\nThe Experience-driven Lifelong Learning framework presents a compelling vision for self-evolving AI agents, but\nrealizing this vision requires overcoming several fundamental challenges. These challenges span perception, memory,\nreasoning, and learning dynamics, and are central to building agents that learn continuously from real-world interaction.\nBelow, we outline five key obstacles that must be addressed to enable robust and scalable ELL systems.\nEfficient Exploration and Experience Acquisition\nA core requirement of ELL is that agents learn from experience\nthrough continuous interaction. However, real-world environments are vast and complex, making blind exploration\ninefficient and often infeasible. The challenge lies in enabling goal-directed yet exploratory behavior\u2014how can an agent\nbalance exploiting known strategies with discovering novel, high-value experiences? Unlike traditional reinforcement\nlearning settings with dense rewards, ELL agents operate in open-ended domains where the utility of an experience may\nonly become apparent much later. This necessitates intrinsic motivation mechanisms\u2014such as curiosity, prediction error,\nor information gain\u2014that guide the agent toward meaningful interactions. Moreover, agents must learn to prioritize\nactions that yield informative feedback, avoid redundant trials, and generalize from limited exposure, ensuring that each\nexperience contributes meaningfully to long-term growth.\nLong-Term Memory and Associative Recall\nFor self-evolving agents, memory is not just storage\u2014it is a dynamic,\nstructured knowledge base that supports reasoning, planning, and skill transfer. A major challenge is building a scalable\nand accessible long-term memory system that retains information over extended time horizons and enables associative\nrecall across seemingly unrelated events. Human cognition excels at linking distant memories (e.g., applying a lesson\nfrom a past course to a current research problem), but current AI systems struggle with both retention and cross-context\nretrieval. Catastrophic forgetting, memory interference, and indexing inefficiencies hinder performance. Furthermore,\nmemory must support multiple modalities (facts, events, strategies) and allow for semantic, temporal, and causal\nindexing. Without such capabilities, agents cannot build a coherent understanding of their experiences or leverage\nhistorical knowledge to inform future decisions.\nSkill Abstraction and Management\nIn ELL, skills are the reusable units of behavior derived from experience.\nHowever, defining and managing skills poses multiple challenges: What is the right granularity? Should a skill\nrepresent a low-level action (e.g., \"send an email\") or a high-level strategy (e.g., \"finish a project\")? How can skills be\nreliably extracted from interaction trajectories, validated for correctness, and organized for efficient retrieval? Beyond\ndefinition, skills must be dynamically managed: they should be composed, refined, and updated as new experiences\nemerge. The agent must also develop a mechanism for skill selection, determining which skill to apply in a given\ncontext, and for detecting when a skill fails, triggering reflection and revision. Without formalized skill life cycles\n(acquisition, validation, invocation, and evolution), agents risk accumulating brittle or redundant behaviors that hinder\nrather than help adaptation.\n9\n\nPRIME AI paper\nSkill Internalization and Generalization\nEven when skills are successfully acquired, the challenge remains of\ninternalizing them, transforming explicit, rule-based knowledge into intuitive, generalized capabilities. In humans,\nthis process resembles the shift from deliberate practice to \"second nature\" performance, often supported by offline\nconsolidation (e.g., during sleep). For AI agents, internalization requires mechanisms that distill procedural knowledge\ninto compact, parameter-efficient representations that can be rapidly adapted to new domains. This involves meta-\nlearning, neural-symbolic integration, or latent policy refinement. A key question is when and how internalization\nshould occur: should it happen after repeated successful execution, during idle periods, or triggered by performance\nplateaus? Moreover, internalized skills must retain interpretability and composability, enabling agents to explain,\ncombine, and debug their behavior, critical for trust and safety in open-ended environments.\nSparse and Ill-Defined Reward Signals\nFinally, ELL operates in environments where external rewards are sparse,\ndelayed, or entirely absent. Unlike benchmark tasks with clear success metrics, real-world learning often lacks\nimmediate feedback. An agent may spend hours navigating a complex task sequence only to receive a single binary\noutcome at the end, if any. Worse, many tasks (e.g., writing a research proposal or resolving a scheduling conflict)\nlack objective evaluation functions altogether. This makes traditional reinforcement learning approaches impractical.\nInstead, ELL agents must rely on self-generated supervision: internal reward models, consistency checks, prediction\nerrors, or reflective judgment. Designing such intrinsic motivation systems, capable of generating meaningful learning\nsignals from experience alone, remains a major open problem. Without them, agents cannot sustain learning in the\nabsence of external feedback, severely limiting their autonomy and adaptability.\nAddressing these challenges will require interdisciplinary advances in memory architectures, meta-learning, cognitive\nmodeling, and intrinsic motivation. While significant hurdles remain, overcoming them is essential for building truly\nself-evolving agents that learn not just from data, but from life.\n4\nOur StuLife Benchmark\nWe present and release StuLife, a benchmark for experience-driven lifelong learning with self-evolving agents. We\nbegin with a detailed description of the dataset, outlining its design, structure, and key features. Next, we describe\nthe methodology for constructing the benchmark, including task formulation, environment dynamics, and evaluation\nprotocols. We then systematically compare StuLife with existing benchmarks in continual learning, agent-based\nAI, embodied intelligence, and self-evolving systems, highlighting its unique capabilities and advantages. We further\nevaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on StuLife to assess their lifelong learning and adaptive reasoning abilities. Finally, we\nexplore the role of context engineering, the strategic organization of memory, prompts, and experience, as a promising\ndirection toward more robust and autonomous artificial general intelligence.\n4.1\nDataset Description\nWe introduce StuLife, a comprehensive benchmark for Experience-driven Lifelong Learning (ELL) that simulates a\nstudent\u2019s academic journey through a dynamically evolving environment (Table 1). The dataset is structured around\nthree core activity modules, including In-Class Tasks, Daily Campus Tasks, and Examination Tasks, designed to evaluate\nagents\u2019 abilities in continuous learning, long-term planning, memory retention, and adaptive decision-making. Spanning\na simulated academic term, StuLife comprises 1,284 task instances across 10 interconnected scenarios, organized to\nreflect the natural distribution of student activities in real-world educational settings.\nIn-Class Tasks\nThis module focuses on structured academic learning and foundational knowledge acquisition,\nencompassing a total of 486 tasks. It includes formal instruction scenarios where agents engage with curricular content,\nadhere to academic norms, and develop domain-specific understanding.\n\u2022 Regulations Learning: Agents study the Academic Integrity Guidelines and Student Handbook, answering compre-\nhension questions to internalize academic integrity rules and campus regulations. This forms the basis for compliant\nand responsible behavior.\n\u2022 Core Course Instruction: Each course consists of weekly learning episodes (e.g., lectures, readings, and concept\nchecks), totaling 416 in-class interactions with 8 courses. Agents must process textual materials, answer subject-\nspecific questions, and, critically, attend sessions at the correct times and locations. This temporal-spatial requirement\nevaluates organizational discipline and routine adherence, simulating real-world accountability.\nDaily Campus Tasks\nThis module captures the diverse, self-directed activities that constitute student life beyond the\nclassroom, comprising 638 tasks in total. These tasks emphasize planning, resource management, social integration,\nand goal-oriented behavior.\n10\n\nPRIME AI paper\nTable 1: The statistic information of StuLife. #Num means the number of samples. #Avg Len and #Max Len mean\nthe average and max number of tokens. #LTM and # Self-Motivation are the number of samples that need long-term\nmemory and self-motivation.\nCore Scenarios Interconnected Scenarios #Num #Avg Len #Max Len #LTM #Self-Motivat\nIn-Class\nRegulations Learning\n70\n9125\n9969\n23\n70\nCore Course Instruction\n416\n9203\n10368\n129\n416\nTotal\n486\n9191\n10368\n152\n486\nDaily Campus\nCampus Exploration\n75\n2921\n3006\n25\n25\nInitial Course Selection\n150\n3136\n3420\n50\n0\nPreliminary Planning\n50\n3069\n3133\n50\n0\nAcademic Activity\n72\n3193\n3466\n22\n22\nLibrary Study\n151\n2080\n3068\n50\n50\nClub Activity\n140\n2981\n3124\n45\n45\nTotal\n637\n2883\n3466\n242\n142\nExamination\nMidterm Exams\n80\n3264\n3520\n80\n0\nFinal Exams\n80\n3507\n3686\n80\n0\nTotal\n160\n3386\n3686\n160\n0\nTotal\nTotal\n1284\n5792\n10368\n554\n628\n\u2022 Campus Exploration: Agents use a digital map tool to locate key facilities (e.g., library, registrar) based on\npeer-suggested itineraries, developing spatial awareness and environmental familiarity.\n\u2022 Initial Course Selection: A complex, multi-step task requiring agents to analyze degree requirements, browse course\nofferings, manage a draft schedule, and strategically use limited \"priority cards\" to secure preferred classes. This\nevaluates early-stage decision-making under constraints and goal prioritization.\n\u2022 Preliminary Planning: Agents check course prerequisite relationships to conduct mandatory course planning and\npre-selection for the upcoming semester. This task assesses foresight, knowledge consolidation, and long-term\nstrategic planning.\n\u2022 Academic Activity: Agents filter advisors by research area or teaching style, initiate contact via email, and complete\nassigned preparatory tasks, simulating advisor-student collaboration.\n\u2022 Library Resource Management Agents perform complex queries to locate books or reserve study spaces under\nconstraints (e.g., noise level, power availability), assessing information retrieval and optimization skills.\n\u2022 Student Club Engagement: During recruitment events, agents select clubs based on interest tags and complete\norganizational tasks (e.g., booking rooms, scheduling meetings), promoting responsibility and social integration.\nExamination Tasks\nThis module evaluates knowledge retention, performance under pressure, and response to\nfeedback, consisting of 160 examination tasks. It includes both formative and summative assessments that influence\nsubsequent academic trajectories.\n\u2022 Midterm Exams: Administered in Week 10, midterms assess partial knowledge retention across all enrolled courses\n(10 questions per subject), requiring agents to accurately retrieve relevant knowledge from the complex and diverse\ntopics covered in the first half of the semester. To better align with real-world scenarios, the midterm exam is\ndesignated as an \"in-class exam\". Agents must go to the corresponding classroom during class time to take the exam.\nFollowing the exams, agents are assigned targeted learning tasks for additional reinforcement and consolidation of\nthe subjects tested.\n\u2022 Final Exams: Held at semester\u2019s end, final exams test comprehensive understanding of course content (10 questions\nper subject). This requires agents to synthesize and recall information from the entire semester\u2019s curriculum. Unlike\nthe midterm exam, the final exam is designated as an \"online exam\". Agents do not need to go to the classroom to\ntake the exam, and the focus is on assessing their ability for long-term knowledge retention. Performance reflects\nthe agent\u2019s ability to consolidate and recall knowledge over extended periods, serving as a key metric for long-term\nmemory and learning stability.\n11\n\nPRIME AI paper\nFigure 3: The data generation pipeline for the StuLife Benchmark. The pipeline consists of three sequential steps to\ncreate a complete learning instance. (a) Step 1: Background and Status Generation, where the initial context and the\nagent\u2019s current state are established. (b) Step 2: Instruction Generation, where a specific task is formulated based on the\ngenerated background. (c) Step 3: Solution Generation and Verification, where a correct solution to the instruction is\nproduced and subsequently verified. (d) A overview of the StuLife Benchmark.\n4.2\nBenchmark Construction\nTo ensure the quality, realism, and logical coherence of StuLife, we implement a systematic, multi-stage construction\nprocess, as illustrated in Figure 3. This process is divided into three core stages: (a) background and status generation,\n(b) instruction generation, and (c) solution generation and verification.\nStep 1: Background and Status Generation.\nThis initial stage focus on creating the foundational elements of the\nsimulated campus environment and defining the state of each task. First, we generate a rich and detailed campus\nbackground using the Deepseek-R1 model. This includes a comprehensive set of environmental and academic\ninformation: geographical data (e.g., campus maps, road networks, building layouts, and library seating arrangements),\ninstitutional documents (e.g., student handbooks, academic integrity policies, and degree requirements), and essential\ndatabases (e.g., course catalogs, faculty profiles, student club rosters, and library holdings). Second, to ensure strong\nlogical and causal dependencies between tasks, we employ deterministic algorithms and local scripts to generate the\nstatus for each task. This is particularly crucial for establishing a coherent timeline for the agent\u2019s activities, dictating the\nsequence and dependencies of \"Daily Campus Tasks\". For instance, for campus exploration tasks, we deterministically\ngenerate the exploration routes, including start-points, end-points, and waypoints, based on the pre-existing map to\ncreate a verifiable ground truth for agent behavior. Similarly, for \"In-Class Tasks\", we carefully design and sequence\nthe \"key knowledge points\" for each course to ensure a logical progression of learning, which directly informed the\nscope of the midterm and final exams.\nStep 2: Instruction Generation.\nIn the second stage, we transform the structured, deterministic information from\nStep 1 into natural language instructions for the agent. Using the Deepseek-R1 model, we convert the pre-defined\nconstraints and objectives into clear, actionable prompts. For \"Daily Campus Tasks\", this involves translating the\ndeterministically generated parameters (e.g., exploration waypoints or course selection rules) into natural language. For\n\"In-Class Tasks\" and \"Examination Tasks\", this means using the curated \"key knowledge points\" and \"teaching focus\"\nto generate relevant lecture content, in-class questions, and examination questions. This step effectively bridges the gap\nbetween the backend logic and the agent\u2019s interactive experience, resulting in a complete set of task data for \"Daily\nCampus Tasks\" and instructional prompts for \"In-Class Tasks\".\nStep 3: Solution Generation and Verification.\nThe final stage ensures the correctness and solvability of the generated\ntasks, especially those requiring long-term knowledge retention. We adapt a generate-and-verify protocol for the \"In-\nClass\" and \"Examination Tasks\". We first prompt the LLM with the relevant lecture content and textbook information to\ngenerate both a correct answer and several plausible but incorrect distractor answers for each question. After generation,\nwe discard the distractors and use the same LLM to verify the accuracy of the \"correct answer\". Crucially, to validate\nthat tasks were solvable given the appropriate long-term knowledge, we simulate an agent with \"optimal long-term\n12\n\nRegulations\nBackground Generation ning\nHelp me generate a Academic Pret aa\nActivity \u2014 6\nV Generate - L.

Any question that could\nnot be consistently answered correctly through this process underwent manual revision until it met the solvability\ncriteria. Finally, all generated data is subjected to a manual sampling and inspection process to ensure high quality and\nconsistency across the entire benchmark.\n4.3\nComparison with Existing Benchmarks\nIn this section, we compare our StuLife benchmark with the existing benchmarks about continual learning, embodied\nAI, agent, and self-evolving (Table 2). StuLife stands out as a comprehensive benchmark for ELL by addressing key\nlimitations of existing datasets. As shown in Table 1, while benchmarks like Lifelong-CIFAR10 and Lifelong-ImageNet\n[31] focus on continuous learning (CL) with sequential task presentation, they lack features such as skill learning,\nlong-term memory, self-motivation, and real-world interactivity. Similarly, CGLB [32] addresses catastrophic forgetting\nin graph data but does not incorporate realistic, interconnected tasks or experience-driven learning. Embodied AI\nbenchmarks like EgoThink [33] and EmbodiedBench [34] introduce dynamic environments and interactive tasks but\nstill fall short in supporting lifelong learning, skill abstraction, and longitudinal growth. AgentBench [35] represents a\nsignificant advancement by evaluating LLMs as agents across eight interactive environments, emphasizing multi-turn\nreasoning and decision-making. However, it is primarily designed for static evaluation of agent capabilities at a fixed\npoint in time, rather than tracking continuous growth or self-evolution. LifelongAgentBench [38] is the first to target\nself-evolving agents, offering interdependent tasks across diverse domains. However, it primarily focuses on technical\nenvironments (e.g., databases, operating systems) and lacks the rich, evolving personal context and intrinsic motivation\nthat characterize natural learning processes.\nStuLife is designed as a principled, realistic, and extensible benchmark that advances the evaluation of self-evolving,\nELL agents. Unlike conventional benchmarks focused on isolated task performance, StuLife integrates environmental\nrealism, self-evolutionary dynamics, and scalable evaluation into a unified framework. Particularly, it simulates a\nstudent\u2019s college journey, featuring interconnected tasks that evolve over time based on dynamic factors such as advisor\nselection, course availability, and social interactions. This structure enables agents to learn from experience, retain\nknowledge across tasks, transfer skills, and exhibit self-motivated behavior, all essential components of true lifelong\nlearning. Unlike existing datasets, StuLife provides a holistic evaluation platform that captures the complexity of\nreal-world intelligence, making it an ideal benchmark for advancing self-evolving AI systems. Below, we highlight its\ncore advantages.\nEnvironmental Realism\nStuLife simulates a full academic term through a longitudinal, narrative-driven structure\nthat mirrors the continuous and evolving nature of real-world learning. Tasks unfold in a temporally coherent sequence,\nspanning enrollment, coursework, extracurricular engagement, and long-term planning, with rich scene descriptions,\ncharacter interactions, and situational dialogues. This sequential and interdependent design ensures that early decisions\n(e.g., course selection, mentor choice) have lasting consequences on later outcomes (e.g., preliminary planning,\nAcademic Activity), fostering cumulative knowledge acquisition and skill transfer. By modeling both academic and\nsocial dimensions of student life, StuLife captures the multifaceted challenges of real-world environments, effectively\nbridging the \"sim-to-real\" gap. The environment is highly interactive, supporting dynamic agent-object interactions,\nwhile promoting open-ended exploration: agents are not constrained by fixed goals but are encouraged to engage in\nself-directed learning, hallmarks of autonomous intelligence.\n13\n\nPRIME AI paper\nSupport for Self-Evolving Intelligence\nAs shown in Fig 2, StuLife is designed to evaluate and foster self-evolving\nbehavior in intelligent agents through three foundational principles:\n1) From Imitation to Learning: Tasks are explicitly structured around skill acquisition and reuse, focusing on\ngeneralizable competencies such as time management, information retrieval, navigation, and social coordination. Rather\nthan merely replicating patterns, agents must abstract experiences into reusable skills and transfer them across evolving\nchallenges, a hallmark of true lifelong learning.\n2) From Context to Memory: The benchmark emphasizes long-term memory and dynamic state evolution, requiring\nagents to retain and apply knowledge across weeks of simulated academic time. Key contextual variables\u2014such as\ncourse eligibility, advisor trust, and scheduling constraints, evolve based on agent decisions, creating a feedback-rich\nenvironment that rewards consistency, foresight, and effective knowledge retention over time.\n3) From Passive to Proactive: Moving beyond reactive task execution, the narrative-driven design encourages intrinsic\nmotivation and self-directed behavior. Agents must proactively manage deadlines, interpret academic feedback (e.g.,\nresponding to performance warnings), reflect on past outcomes, and adjust strategies autonomously\u2014mimicking the\ninitiative and adaptive planning seen in real learners.\nTogether with dedicated metrics for memory utilization, skill acquisition, and cross-task generalization, StuLife\nprovides a comprehensive framework for evaluating not just task performance, but the deeper cognitive growth and\nautonomous development necessary for self-evolving AI. In summary, StuLife transcends traditional benchmarks by\nembedding lifelong learning within a realistic, evolving, and narratively grounded environment. It uniquely supports\nthe development and evaluation of agents that do not merely perform tasks, but learn from experience, grow over time,\nand act with autonomy, making it a foundational platform for the next generation of self-evolving AI.\n4.4\nEvaluating the Existing SOTA LLMs\n4.4.1\nDefining Evaluation Metrics\nTo provide a multi-faceted assessment of agent performance on StuLife, we establish a suite of evaluation metrics.\nThese are designed to measure not only task success but also the nuances of learning, the durability of knowledge, and\nthe efficiency of agent behavior. The metrics are ordered to provide a comprehensive analysis, starting from a holistic,\nstudent-centric score and progressively delving into more specific aspects of agent intelligence.\n\u2022 StuGPA (General Performance Assessment): To evaluate agents in a manner that mirrors real-world student\nassessment, we introduce the StuGPA. This composite score, calculated out of 100, moves beyond simple task\naccuracy to holistically measure an agent\u2019s performance across dimensions of academic and personal development.\nThis score is designed to reflect the holistic evaluation criteria used in actual educational settings, where success\nis not determined solely by exam results, but also by consistent engagement, responsible behavior, and classroom\nparticipation. The GPA is computed as a weighted sum of three core components:\n\u2013 Exam Performance (50 Points): This is the cornerstone of the GPA, assessing the agent\u2019s knowledge mastery\nthrough its average accuracy on the Midterm and Final Exams. This component directly measures the outcomes of\nlong-term learning and knowledge consolidation under high-stakes conditions.\n\u2013 Class Performance (30 Points): This component evaluates the agent\u2019s commitment and adherence to academic\nroutines. It is calculated based on the attendance rate for all required In-Class Tasks. This metric deliberately\nfocuses on the process, being at the right place at the right time, rather than the correctness of in-class answers,\nwhich is already assessed in exams.\n\u2013 Campus Daily Life (20 Points): This evaluates the agent as a \"campus citizen.\" It is composed of advisor task\ncompletion (8 points), Club Activity(6 points), and a Personal Responsibility score (6 points). The responsibility\nscore begins at 6 and is reduced for infractions such as resource squandering (e.g., booking a library seat but not\nusing it) or broken commitments (e.g., missing a self-scheduled meeting).\n\u2022 Long-Term Retention Rate (LTRR): This evaluates the agent\u2019s capacity to combat catastrophic forgetting. It is\ncalculated as the success rate on tasks requiring knowledge from the past (e.g., information presented over a week\nago, such as in midterm or final exams). These tasks require the recall and synthesis of information presented prior,\nproviding a clear and stringent test of long-term memory. A high LTRR signifies a robust memory system capable of\nretaining and accessing critical information over time.\n\u2022 Proactive Initiative Score (PIS): This metric assesses an agent\u2019s prospective memory and self-motivation, its ability\nto remember and execute planned intentions at the appropriate time without an immediate prompt. It is measured as\nthe success rate on tasks that must be self-initiated based on a previously established schedule (e.g., attending weekly\nCore Course Instruction at the correct time and location). Success in these tasks demonstrates that the agent can\n14\n\nPRIME AI paper\nTable 3: The performance of existing SOTA LLMs (Default Setting).

We measure the overall success rate, defined as the\nproportion of tasks an agent successfully completes across the entire benchmark (Acctotal). A task is considered\nsuccessful only if the agent achieves the final objective. To offer a more granular view of an agent\u2019s capabilities, we\nalso report the accuracy for each of the three core modules: In-Class, Daily Campus, and Examination Tasks.\n\u2022 Average Turns: We measure interaction efficiency by calculating the average number of interaction turns required to\ncomplete a task successfully, denoted as AvgTurns. It sums the number of interactions for all successful trajectories\nand dividing by the total number of successfully completed tasks. A lower AvgTurns value signifies higher efficiency\nand more sophisticated problem-solving, as the agent achieves its goals with fewer steps.\n4.5\nExperimental Analysis\n4.5.1\nExperimental Setup\nModels Evaluated\nWe assess a diverse set of ten prominent Large Language Models (LLMs) as the cognitive\nengines for our intelligent agents. The models under study include: Llama-3.1-8B1, Qwen3-7B [9], Qwen3-32B [9],\nQWQ-32B [39], Deepseek-V3 [40], Qwen3-235B [9], GPT-52, Claude 3.7 Sonnet3, Gemini 2.5 Pro4, and Grok-45.\nThese models represent the current frontier in understanding, reasoning, and agentic capabilities. Comprehensive\nbenchmarking results and performance analysis will be presented in a forthcoming extended version.\nEvaluation Protocol\nThe StuLife benchmark is designed as a single, continuous trajectory where tasks are presented\nserially, and the environment is stateful\u2014meaning an agent\u2019s actions in one task can have persistent consequences\nthat affect subsequent tasks. In our primary evaluation protocol, each task is presented to the agent as an independent,\nisolated instance. The agent operates without access to any historical context or memory from previous interactions,\nany cross-task information retention relies entirely on the agent\u2019s explicit actions to save and later retrieve data using\nthe provided environmental tools, such as a calendar, or draft. This stateless approach serves as a crucial baseline\nto measure the models\u2019 intrinsic, in-context reasoning and problem-solving abilities without the aid of accumulated\nexperience. All experiments are conducted on Linux servers, and our framework supports automatic checkpointing to\nensure robustness and allow for recovery from interruptions. To ensure a fair and reproducible comparison, all agents\nare integrated through APIs and share a standardized initialization process.\n4.5.2\nMain Results\nAs shown in Table 3, the performance of all models under our default stateless setting is exceptionally poor. This stems\nfrom a fundamental architectural limitation: current large language models are inherently stateless and do not possess\nany native long-term memory modules. This core deficiency manifests in two critical failures observed throughout\nour experiments. First, the models exhibit a significant lack of proactive initiative, failing to trigger goal-directed\nactions without explicit, immediate commands. For instance, for a task scheduled to be completed at 8:00, even when\nan agent is notified that the current time is precisely 8:00, it often fails to initiate the corresponding action. This issue\n1https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/the-llama-3-herd-of-models/\n2https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5/\n3https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet\n4https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/pro/\n5https://x.ai/news/grok-4\n15\n\nPRIME AI paper\nstems from a more fundamental problem: the agent does not even think to consult its schedule to check for tasks at the\ncurrent time, regardless of whether that schedule was successfully added in a prior step. Second, long-term memory\nretention remains a critical challenge. Given their lack of a memory architecture, models are fundamentally unable\nto recall and utilize information from distant past interactions, which severely limits their ability to build coherent,\ncumulative knowledge over time. Third, the results indicate a clear correlation between model scale and performance\nThere is a significant performance gap between the smallest model, Llama-3.1-8B (StuGPA of 5.58), and the mid-sized\n32B models like QWQ-32B (StuGPA of 12.89). The largest open-source and proprietary models, such as Gemini 2.5\nPro and GPT-5, occupy the top tier, achieving the highest overall success rates (13.53% and 12.35%, respectively).\nHowever, it is crucial to note that even these state-of-the-art models perform poorly, with the top StuGPA score barely\nreaching 17.76 out of 100. This suggests that while scaling up provides some benefits in reasoning, it is not a sufficient\nsolution to overcome the fundamental challenges of proactive, long-term agency posed by our benchmark.\n4.6\nEvaluating the Role of Context Engineering in Advancing AGI\nBeyond evaluating state-of-the-art large language models on the StuLife benchmark, we make a critical contribution\nby systematically investigating the impact of context engineering, on agent performance in complex, long-horizon\ntasks. While much of current AI development focuses on scaling models or improving weights through training, our\nresults demonstrate that optimizing the context prompt can yield comparable or even greater gains in task success\nrates. We evaluate multiple variants of system prompts, ranging from minimal instruction sets to proactive, memory-\naugmented, and skill-augmented frameworks, and show that well-designed prompts significantly enhance planning,\nmemory utilization, and skill transfer.\nWe design five distinct prompting strategies to systematically investigate different dimensions of agent intelligence in a\nsimulated academic environment:\n\u2022 Vanilla Prompt: This serves as the minimal baseline, assigning only a high-level role to the agent without any\nprocedural guidance or cognitive scaffolding. It establishes a foundation for measuring the model\u2019s intrinsic reasoning\nand task execution capabilities in the absence of explicit strategy instruction.\n\u2022 Proactive Prompt: In contrast to the vanilla setup, this approach incorporates structured behavioral guidance,\nemphasizing principles such as time-awareness, goal decomposition, and forward planning. The objective is to\nencourage the agent to emulate the organizational habits and strategic thinking of a high-performing student.\n\u2022 Memory-Augmented Prompt: To evaluate long-term knowledge retention and adaptive learning, agents are\naugmented with external memory mechanisms, such as full-context recall or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),\nthat simulate cumulative learning over an academic term. This configuration enables assessment of how effectively\nagents leverage past experiences to improve future performance. Addressing limitations observed in stateless\nevaluations, we are currently conducting extended experiments with various memory architectures; a detailed analysis\nwill be included in a future version of this work.\n\u2022 Skill-Augmented Prompt: This design provides a methodological blueprint for solving complex, multi-step tasks.\nBy embedding a step-by-step \"recipe\" for a specific skill (e.g., problem-solving or experimental design), it guides the\nagent in decomposing challenges and applying foundational capabilities in a structured, generalizable manner.\n\u2022 All-in-One Prompt: This comprehensive framework integrates proactive planning, memory utilization, and skill-\nspecific methodologies into a unified cognitive architecture. It aims to assess the upper bound of an agent\u2019s\nself-evolving intelligence\u2014evaluating its capacity to plan strategically, retain knowledge, and refine skills through\nexperience\u2014towards building more autonomous and adaptive AI agents.\nA full report of the experimental results will be presented in the next version of this paper.\n4.7\nFuture Directions for StuLife\nTo further enhance the realism, scalability, and long-term relevance of StuLife as a platform for evaluating self-evolving\nagents, we outline several key directions for future development:\n\u2022 Integration of More Complex Tools: In future versions, agents will be required to interact with increasingly\nsophisticated tools\u2014such as code interpreters, database query systems, calendar schedulers with conflict detection,\nand email clients with threading logic. This will elevate the cognitive and procedural demands on agents, pushing\nthem beyond simple API calls toward robust tool mastery and multi-step workflow automation.\n\u2022 Modeling Strong Task Interdependencies: We plan to introduce deeper structural dependencies between tasks,\nparticularly in academic progression. For example, courses will be organized in prerequisite chains (e.g., \"Introduction\n16\n\nPRIME AI paper\nto Algorithms\" must be passed before enrolling in \"Advanced Data Structures\"), and performance in early tasks will\ndirectly influence access to advanced opportunities (e.g., research positions or honors programs). These dependencies\nwill enforce long-term planning and reward consistent knowledge accumulation.\n\u2022 Dynamic and Flexible Rule Evolution: To better simulate real-world institutional environments, the benchmark\nwill support runtime updates to rules and policies (e.g., changes in graduation requirements, course availability,\nor academic regulations). This capability will allow the environment to evolve over time, preventing agents from\noverfitting to static conditions and encouraging adaptive, resilient behavior in the face of change.\n\u2022 Increased Task Complexity to Prevent Exploitation: We will design tasks that inherently resist shortcut solutions\nor prompt-based memorization, ensuring that high performance requires genuine understanding, reasoning, and\nexperience accumulation. By incorporating open-ended problem-solving, partial observability, and stochastic\noutcomes, we aim to discourage \"leaderboard hacking\" and promote robust, generalizable intelligence.\n\u2022 Development of a General-Purpose Benchmarking Framework: We are building a modular framework to enable\nrapid adaptation of the StuLife paradigm to other domains, such as workplace onboarding, healthcare management,\ninternships, research projects, and career planning. This framework will support plug-and-play task modules,\nconfigurable rule engines, and standardized evaluation interfaces, empowering researchers to create domain-specific\nbenchmarks while maintaining compatibility with the core ELL evaluation metrics.\n5\nConclusions\nIn this paper, we introduced Experience-driven Lifelong Learning (ELL), a framework for building self-evolving AI\nagents that learn and grow through continuous interaction with dynamic environments. Inspired by human cognitive\ndevelopment, ELL emphasizes three core principles: learning from experience, long-term memory integration, and\nskill abstraction, enabling agents not only to adapt to change but to proactively shape their own learning trajectories.\nTo advance research in this direction, we present StuLife, a comprehensive benchmark that simulates a student\u2019s\ncollege journey as a rich, longitudinal environment with interconnected academic, social, and planning tasks. StuLife\ngoes beyond conventional benchmarks by incorporating evolving contexts, sparse rewards, and the need for self-\ninitiated behavior, making it a powerful platform for evaluating lifelong learning, memory retention, and autonomous\ndecision-making. Our experiments reveal critical limitations in current LLM-based agents\u2014particularly their lack of\nself-motivation and poor long-term memory\u2014highlighting the gap between today\u2019s systems and truly self-evolving\nintelligence. Importantly, we demonstrate that performance on complex, extended tasks can be significantly improved\nnot only through model scale but through context engineering, particularly via well-designed system prompts. This\nsuggests that the path to AGI may depend as much on how we structure an agent\u2019s cognitive framework as on the\nraw capabilities of the underlying model. Looking forward, ELL and StuLife provide a principled foundation for\ndeveloping agents that accumulate knowledge, transfer skills, and evolve autonomously over time. By shifting the focus\nfrom isolated task performance to sustained, experience-driven growth, we aim to catalyze progress toward intelligent\nsystems that, like humans, become wiser with every experience.\nReferences\n[1] Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun.

The environment is engineered as a deterministic, persistent,\nand stateful world, compelling the agent to engage in complex information integration, strategic planning, and multi-step\ntask execution. Its architecture is founded on several core principles designed to ensure reproducibility, task complexity,\nand fair evaluation.\nA.1\nCore Architectural Principles\nThe design of StuLife Bench is predicated on a clear separation of concerns, distinguishing the world\u2019s state and\nmechanics from the tasks an agent must perform.\n\u2022 Persistent World State: The environment is instantiated as a single, centralized, and stateful object that\npersists across the entire lifecycle of an agent\u2019s evaluation. This ensures that actions taken in one task have\nlasting consequences on the world state, creating longitudinal dependencies and requiring the agent to maintain\na coherent long-term strategy. For instance, a course registered in the first week remains on the agent\u2019s schedule\nfor all subsequent tasks.\n\u2022 Deterministic Subsystems: All components of the environment operate on rule-based, deterministic logic.\nRandomness is explicitly excluded from the simulation\u2019s mechanics to guarantee that for a given sequence of\nagent actions, the resulting state transitions and outcomes are always identical. This determinism is crucial for\nthe reproducibility of experiments and the objective comparison of different agents.\n\u2022 Separation of Environment and Task Logic: The architecture strictly separates the Environment, which\nsimulates the world and its atomic physics (e.g., moving between locations, sending an email), from the Task\nController. The Task Controller is responsible for presenting natural language instructions, mediating all\nagent-environment interactions by dispatching agent-invoked tools to the Environment, and finally, evaluating\nthe agent\u2019s performance by comparing the final state of the Environment against a task-specific ground truth.\nA.2\nWorld State and Temporal Dynamics\nThe simulation of time and its effect on the agent\u2019s schedule is a passive, event-driven process that provides essential\ncontext for tasks.\n\u2022 World Time System: The agent cannot directly control or query the flow of time. Instead, the system injects\ntemporal context into the agent\u2019s observation space at the beginning of tasks. This is achieved through system\nannouncements (e.g., \u201dSystem Announcement: Today is the Saturday of the second week.\u201d) and time-specific\nprompts (e.g., \u201dSystem Prompt: It is now 8:00 AM.\u201d). This mechanism serves to trigger time-sensitive tasks\nand test the agent\u2019s ability to react to temporal cues.\n\u2022 Calendar System: The environment maintains a persistent, multi-identity calendar system. The agent can\nmanage its personal schedule, contribute to shared schedules (e.g., for a student club), and query the availability\nof others (e.g., an advisor). The system enforces a differentiated permission model: full create, read, update,\ndelete (CRUD) operations on the personal calendar, append-only access to club calendars, and read-only\n(busy/free) access to advisor schedules.\nA.3\nSpatial and Geographic Simulation\nThe agent\u2019s interaction with the physical campus is mediated by a dual-component system that separates spatial\nknowledge from physical action.\n\u2022 Map Lookup System: A static, read-only information provider that contains the complete geographical data\nof the campus, including buildings, rooms, and their properties. It exposes tools for the agent to find building\nIDs from names, retrieve detailed location information, and, crucially, compute deterministic optimal paths\nbetween any two points, subject to specified constraints.\n\u2022 Geography System: A dynamic state tracker that maintains the agent\u2019s current physical location. To change\nits position, the agent must first use the Map Lookup System to plan a path and then pass the computed path to\na specific tool in the Geography System to execute the movement. This two-step process explicitly models the\nseparation of planning from execution. The agent\u2019s location is automatically reset to a default starting point\n(e.g., a dormitory) at the beginning of each simulated day.\n20\n\nPRIME AI paper\nA.4\nAcademic Course Selection System\nThis subsystem simulates the complex, high-stakes process of university course registration, designed to test strategic\nresource allocation under constraints. The core mechanic is a weighted selection process.\n\u2022 Stateful Planning and Registration: The agent first formulates a preliminary plan by adding courses to a\ndraft schedule. This plan can be modified freely. The final registration is a distinct, atomic action where the\ndraft is submitted for processing.\n\u2022 Priority Pass Mechanism: Success in registration is determined by a set of deterministic rules based on\na course\u2019s dynamic popularity_index and a limited set of \u201dPriority Passes\u201d (S-Pass, A-Pass, B-Pass)\nthat the agent can assign to courses in its draft. For example, an A-Pass guarantees enrollment if the course\npopularity is below 95, while a B-Pass succeeds only if popularity is below 85. The agent must strategically\nuse these passes on high-demand courses to ensure successful registration. The popularity and seat availability\nof courses evolve between tasks, requiring the agent to continuously adapt its strategy.\nA.5\nResource Reservation System\nThis system manages the booking of shared campus facilities, such as library study rooms and seminar halls. Its most\nnotable feature is a mechanism for dynamically generating availability to create well-posed decision-making puzzles.\n\u2022 Intelligent Availability Generation: When an agent queries for available slots at a location relevant to its\ncurrent task, the system does not return a static, pre-defined list. Instead, it dynamically generates a set of\nplausible options based on the task\u2019s specific constraints and ground truth. It reverse-engineers the availability\nlist to ensure that only the ground-truth option satisfies all explicit and implicit requirements of the task, while\npresenting other options as meaningful distractors. For all other queries not central to the task, availability is\ngenerated randomly while respecting existing bookings. This design ensures that each reservation task is a\nsolvable, self-contained puzzle.\nA.6\nInformation Retrieval Systems\nThe agent accesses static world knowledge through a set of read-only query tools, which are divided into two distinct\nstructural paradigms.\n\u2022 Hierarchical Bibliography System: This system contains academic texts organized in a strict, four-level\nhierarchy: Book \u2192Chapter \u2192Section \u2192Article. To access a specific piece of information, the agent must\nperform a sequence of iterative, drill-down queries, navigating the hierarchy level by level.\n\u2022 Entity-Based Campus Data System: In contrast, information about campus entities like student clubs and\nacademic advisors is stored in a flat, entity-based structure. This system supports direct queries by category\n(e.g., listing all sports clubs) or by a unique identifier (e.g., retrieving the full profile of a specific advisor),\ntesting the agent\u2019s ability to select the appropriate query strategy for different data structures.\nA.7\nCommunication System\nTo assess the agent\u2019s ability to comprehend instructions and structure information for communication, a basic email\nsystem is provided.\n\u2022 Append-Only Log: The system does not simulate a real email network but rather maintains a persistent,\nappend-only log of all emails the agent sends.\n\u2022 Strict-Matching Evaluation: A task requiring the agent to send an email is evaluated based on a strict,\nverbatim string match of the recipient, subject, and body fields against the ground truth. This rigorously\ntests the agent\u2019s capacity to extract key information from a natural language prompt and format it precisely\naccording to the tool\u2019s requirements.\nB\nTool Suite and Agent Instructions\nTo interact with the StuLife Bench environment, the agent is provided with a comprehensive suite of tools. This section\ndetails the complete action space available to the agent, which is structured as a set of functions grouped by their\ncorresponding subsystems. We first present the foundational instructions that govern the agent\u2019s behavior and response\nformat, followed by the detailed declarations for each tool.\n21\n\nPRIME AI paper\nB.1\nBase Instructions for the Agent\nBefore beginning any task, the agent is initialized with a set of base instructions that define its role, objectives, and the\nrequired format for all actions. This ensures a consistent interaction protocol across all evaluations.\nFoundational Agent Instructions\nYou are an AI agent acting as a student in a university campus environment. Your goal is to complete the tasks\ngiven to you by using a set of available tools to interact with this world.\nAt each step, you will be given an observation of the current state of the environment.

For each query, a deterministic\nprocess generates the ground-truth task status, including the optimal path connecting the source, waypoints,\nand target in sequence.\n\u2022 Constraints such as accessibility, weather exposure, path type, illumination, and congestion are modeled as soft\npenalties. These penalties influence the path selection during planning to generate more diverse and realistic\nroutes.\n\u2022 We concurrently extract structured information about buildings along the path (e.g., official names, aliases,\ncontained areas, and internal facilities) to provide rich, contextual details for the subsequent instruction-writing\nphase.\n\u2022 Query samples are generated following controllable rules (e.g., number of waypoints, probability of constraints)\nto guarantee task diversity, controllability, and realism.\nTwo-Stage LLM Generation\nWe separate the creative and logical aspects of generation into a two-stage LLM\npipeline.\n\u2022 Stage 1: Instruction Generation (Creative Agent). The first stage aims to generate a concise, believable,\nand motivationally-grounded \u2019instruction\u2019 from a first-person perspective. Based on the planned path and\nbuilding information, a creative agent is prompted to write a narrative that naturally embeds all waypoints and\nconstraints. For instance, it might reference a specific internal amenity of a building (e.g., the \"Circulation\nDesk\" in the library) or weave a constraint into the story (e.g., needing an accessible route for a friend).\n\u2022 Stage 2: Solution and Evaluation Trace Generation (Logical Agent). A local, deterministic Python script\ngenerates the ground-truth solution. This script employs Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm to compute the optimal path,\nfrom which the ground-truth action sequence is derived. We ensure that this pathfinding algorithm is identical\nto the one available to the agent during its evaluation phase.\n28\n\nPRIME AI paper\nC.1.1\nVerbatim Prompts for Campus Exploration Task\nInstruction Generation\n### Instructions and Constraints\n1. **Persona and Tone**:\n* You MUST speak as a senior student guide giving a spontaneous challenge.\n* Start with a direct, friendly, and energetic greeting.

Good luck!\n# INPUT\nC.2\nCourse Selection Task\nThis task evaluates an agent\u2019s ability to perform strategic course selection and optimize resource (Pass Card) allocation\nunder complex constraints. Its construction paradigm is centered around Constraint-Driven Unique Solution Con-\nstruction. The goal is to ensure that for any given task scenario\u2014considering course popularity, instructions, and the\nacademic plan\u2014a single optimal solution exists, thereby guaranteeing the reliability of our evaluation.\nData and State Construction\nThe task is built upon a student\u2019s academic plan and the university\u2019s course catalog,\nwhich form the foundational constraints (e.g., credits, prerequisites, time conflicts). Each course is assigned a\n\"popularity\" value from 0 to 100, representing the enrollment competition.\n29\n\nPRIME AI paper\nThe core resource is a hierarchical system of \"Pass Cards\" with the following universal rules:\n\u2022 S-Pass: Can forcibly enroll in any course (popularity 0-100). It is optimally used for courses with a popularity\nof 95-99.\n\u2022 A-Pass: Guarantees enrollment in courses with a popularity below 95.\n\u2022 B-Pass: Can only be used for courses with a popularity below 85; quantity is unlimited.\nThe initial state of the task includes the student\u2019s draft schedule, a ground-truth \"Target Schedule,\" and the Pass Cards\nallocated at the beginning of each semester according to that semester\u2019s rules.\nUnique Solution Construction Mechanism\nTo ensure each task is a logic puzzle with a unique solution, we\ndeterministically back-engineer the popularity of other courses based on the \"Target Schedule\" and the agent\u2019s available\nPass Cards. This transforms a resource allocation problem into a logical reasoning challenge. For instance:\n\u2022 To force the use of an S-Pass, the system will set the popularity of a target required course to 95 or higher.\n\u2022 To guide the use of an A-Pass, the system will set a target course\u2019s popularity to a value between 85 and 94.\nBy precisely orchestrating the popularity of target and distractor courses, all non-optimal paths are logically blocked.\nDynamic Multi-Semester Task Chain\nCourse selection in this benchmark is not a single event but simulates two\nconsecutive and dynamically evolving stages: Semester 1 and Semester 2(Preliminary Planning). The agent\u2019s state at\nthe end of Semester 1 (final schedule and remaining resources) seamlessly becomes the initial state for Semester 2.\nMore challenging, the constraints and resource allocations change between semesters. For example:\n\u2022 Semester 1: Requires completing 8 courses (including at least 6 required ones) and provides 2 A-Passes for\nrequired courses.\n\u2022 Semester 2: Requires 7 courses (including at least 5 required ones), while the A-Pass allocation for required\ncourses is reduced to 1.\nThis dynamically evolving design aims to evaluate an agent\u2019s capabilities for memory, adaptation to new rules, and\nforward-looking resource planning in long-term tasks.\nFinally, the ultimate stage of this task chain is designed as a Convergence Point. Through a scenario like \"joining an\nExcellent Student Program,\" all correctly performing agents are guided to the exact same final schedule, ensuring the\nfairness and comparability of evaluations in subsequent tasks.\nInstruction Generation\nAfter all deterministic states are constructed, this structured information (including the\nspecific rules for each semester) is converted into a natural, context-aware language instruction to guide the agent.\nInstruction Generation\n# ROLE: You are a Master Narrative Designer and creative writer for a complex simulation.\n# TASK: Your mission is to generate the \u2018advice_text\u2018 and \u2018agent_expected_actions_desc\u2018 for\na single step in a student\u2019s course selection journey.

For\nexample, if the persona is \"Roommate\", begin with \"Hey, as your roommate, I was\njust checking the course system and saw...\" or if it\u2019s \"Counselor\", start with \"As\nyour academic counselor, I have some important updates for you.\"\n* **Create a Thematic Cause-and-Effect Narrative**: Your story\u2019s main theme is defined by\nthe \u2018{event_type}\u2018.

You do not need to\nmention every single world state change, only the ones that justify the required\nactions. For example, if the \u2018event_type\u2018 is \u2018Popularity_Update_Risk_Cascade\u2018, you\nshould focus on the courses whose popularity skyrocketed and explain how this new\nrisk forces the specific pass changes and course swaps in the delta.\n* **Refer to Courses by Name**: To make the advice sound like a real, natural\nconversation, you **MUST** refer to courses by their **name only** (e.g., \"Advanced\nAI\", \"Machine Learning\"). **Crucially, do NOT include course codes in your response**\n(e.g., avoid formats like \"CS101\" or \"Advanced AI (CS101)\"). The goal is to\nsimulate a human giving advice, not a system generating a report.\n* **Tone and Style**: Your language **MUST** be conversational, persuasive, and use a \"\nsoft\" or uncertain tone, as if you are giving friendly advice, not commands.\n* **Use Collaborative & Suggestive Phrasing**: Instead of stating conclusions as facts,\nphrase them as suggestions or questions.\n* **Instead of**: \"This course is less popular, so downgrade its pass.\"\n31\n\nPRIME AI paper\n* **Try**: \"This course\u2019s popularity doesn\u2019t seem so crazy anymore, maybe we don\u2019t\nneed to use such a high-priority pass on it? What do you think?\"\n* **Instead of**: \"You must swap this course.\"\n* **Try**: \"I noticed this other course has a better time slot that fits your\nschedule perfectly, perhaps it\u2019s a better option?\"\n* **GOOD EXAMPLE (Natural & Suggestive Tone)**: \"Hey, as your roommate, I was just\nlooking at the course system. \u2019Advanced AI\u2019 seems to be getting way more popular,\nmaybe we should think about using your S-Pass on it just to be safe? If we do that,\nwe could probably free up the A-Pass from \u2019Machine Learning\u2019-its popularity isn\u2019t as\nwild as we thought, so an A-pass might be overkill there. What do you think?\"\n* **BAD EXAMPLE (Too Direct & Factual)**: \"The popularity of \u2019Advanced AI\u2019 has increased,\ntherefore you must upgrade it to an S-Pass.

It\ncovers two temporal requirements, Immediate and Scheduled Execution, and distinguishes between two narrative styles:\ninternal monologue and received message. The overall pipeline follows the paradigm of deterministic state construction\nfollowed by two-stage LLM generation, with a focus on temporal consistency, motivational reasoning, and inferable\nresource needs.\nData and State Construction\nTask seeds are composed of two main categories:\n\u2022 Topic-Based Study: This is divided into \"specific book\" (requiring the use of the data_system.\nsearch_books tool for location) and \"general topic\" types.\nBoth include a \u2019persona\u2019, \u2019reason\u2019, and \u2019im-\nplied_requirements\u2019.\n\u2022 General Study: This centers on finding a seat for effective study. The \u2019persona\u2019 and \u2019reason\u2019 drive implicit seating\nand environmental needs (e.g., \u2019quiet_zone\u2019, \u2019power_outlet\u2019).\nTo simulate diverse scenarios in real campus life, the \u2019persona\u2019 is not limited to the student\u2019s own internal monologue\nbut can also originate from external characters, such as suggestions from a roommate or tasks assigned by a counselor.\nTopic priority balances relevance to the student\u2019s coursework with interdisciplinary interests. To test the agent\u2019s\nability to infer the correct execution location based on task requirements, we have established a strict col-\nlection rule:\nbooks and materials for a specific topic are located in one, and only one, designated li-\n32\n\nPRIME AI paper\nbrary.\nIn the task instruction, the explicit library name is deliberately hidden.\nThe agent must first call the\ndata_system.list_books_by_category(category=...) tool to query the collection information for a specific\ntopic, thereby inferring the correct library location before proceeding with subsequent planning.\nTemporal Semantics and Long-Term Memory Construction\nWe divide tasks into two categories along the temporal\ndimension to evaluate the agent\u2019s full range of capabilities:\n\u2022 Immediate Execution: These tasks require the agent to immediately understand and execute the instruction,\ndesigned to test its rapid response capabilities.\n\u2022 Scheduled Execution for Long-Term Memory: These tasks are specifically designed to evaluate the agent\u2019s\nlong-term memory, planning, and ability to act at specific future points in time. Each scheduled task\nconsists of a Trigger Condition and an Execution Window. The trigger condition is typically a specific\nfuture time point. To construct diverse long-term challenges, the triggers we generate maintain a balanced\nratio between same-day and cross-day time spans.\nInstruction Generation\nInstruction generation integrates two dimensions, narrative style and temporal require-\nments, to create diverse task scenarios. Narratively, instructions can be the student\u2019s first-person internal monologue\n(corresponding to their own thoughts) or a received message (such as a suggestion from a roommate or a task from\na counselor). Temporally, the instruction\u2019s wording will clearly distinguish between tasks that must be executed\nimmediately and those that need to be scheduled for a specific future time. All instructions adhere to strict consis-\ntency constraints, such as maintaining the student\u2019s academic background (Computer Science) and translating abstract\nrequirements into concrete language.\nC.3.1\nVerbatim Prompts for Library Study Task\nStyle A \u00b7 Topic-Based \u00b7 Immediate\n# CONTEXT\nYou are a \"Scenario Generator\" AI.

The environment provides multiple clubs, each\nwith a unique description and information. The agent is required to make autonomous selections and add clubs based on\nthese descriptions, completing the joining process by sending an application email to the correct contact. We introduce\na critical long-term dependency mechanism here: if the agent fails to correctly complete the application task for a\nspecific club, all subsequent tasks related to that club will be automatically marked as failed, regardless of how\nperfectly they are executed. This design aims to evaluate the agent\u2019s ability to handle preconditions and understand\nthe cascading effects of failure.\nData and State Construction\nWe prioritize the construction of structured task elements. First, we generate offline\n\"task components,\" which are atomic actions like book_resource, send_email, and add_calendar_event. De-\npendencies between actions are explicitly annotated at the component level to constrain the execution order. \"Task\nprototypes\" (e.g., \"event organization,\" \"multi-resource booking\") are instantiated by combining club entities with\ncampus building and room data to generate fine-grained, executable parameters.\nTemporal Semantics and Long-Term Memory Construction\nWe divide tasks into two categories along the temporal\ndimension to test the agent\u2019s capabilities in different contexts:\n\u2022 Immediate Execution: These tasks are designed to test the agent\u2019s rapid response and immediate planning\ncapabilities. The narrative persona for these tasks is typically a club leader assigning an urgent task to a\nnew member (the agent).\n\u2022 Scheduled Execution for Long-Term Memory: These tasks are specifically designed to evaluate the agent\u2019s\nlong-term memory, coordination, and ability to execute complex plans at a future point in time. The\nnarrative persona is a club leader assigning a routine task to a member (the agent). The instruction will\nexplicitly state the task\u2019s execution time, testing the agent\u2019s ability to maintain and act on future intentions.\nInstruction Generation\nThe instruction generation process transforms the structured task components and their\ndependencies into a natural language narrative. This process matches the narrative persona (club leader) based on\nwhether the task is \u2019Immediate\u2019 or \u2019Scheduled\u2019. To clearly convey the sequence of actions, the instruction strictly\nfollows the predefined dependencies, using transition words. All email-related actions guide the agent to use standard\nplaceholders, such as <recipient>, <subject>, and <body>. In subsequent processing, these placeholders are filled\nwith deterministic, standardized email content to completely avoid errors or inconsistencies that might arise from\non-the-fly Large Language Model (LLM) generation.\nC.4.1\nVerbatim Prompts for Club Task\nImmediate (Professor \u00b7 Immediate Execution)\nYou are an expert AI assistant that translates task data from JSON into clear, natural\nlanguage instructions for another AI agent.\nYour mission is to generate a set of instructions based on the provided JSON.

Continuing the paradigm of deterministic state construction followed by two-stage LLM generation,\nwe bind advisor entities and timeline constraints to task sets, generating executable and verifiable task chains in a\ncomponent-based manner.\nAdvisor Selection and Long-Term Dependency\nTo simulate the complex process of finding an advisor in the real\nworld, the environment provides a large pool of potential advisors for the agent to filter. The agent\u2019s primary challenge\nis to successfully complete 5 advisor selection tasks based on explicit \u2019requirement descriptions\u2019 (e.g., research\narea, project needs). Among these selection tasks, some are deterministically designed to result in a \u2019rejection by the\nadvisor\u2019 to simulate uncertainty and failure during the selection process.\nSuccessfully establishing a relationship with an advisor is a precondition for all subsequent tasks related to them.\nIf the agent fails to secure a relationship with an advisor from a selection task, all subsequent tasks in that advisor\u2019s\nbranch will be automatically marked as failed. This design aims to evaluate the agent\u2019s ability to manage multiple\nparallel long-term goals and to handle precondition failures and adjust its strategy accordingly.\nData and State Construction\n\u2022 Source and Continuity: Each task originates from the results of the \"advisor selection\" phase and is bound to\na successfully chosen advisor, ensuring that subsequent narratives and actions revolve around this specific\nindividual.\n\u2022 Component-based Structure: Each task consists of three action components with explicitly annotated\ndependencies: send_email (initial communication) -> book_resource (resource booking) -> send_email\n(confirmation/follow-up).\n\u2022 Textual Elements and Placeholders: Email bodies and subjects are generated from diverse templates\nemphasizing academic contexts (e.g., methodology discussions, literature reviews, experiment preparation,\npaper reviews). Sensitive external information is uniformly expressed using placeholders.\nTemporal Semantics and Long-Term Memory Construction\nWe divide tasks into two categories along the temporal\ndimension:\n\u2022 Immediate Execution: These tasks are designed to test the agent\u2019s ability to rapidly decompose and execute\nurgent instructions.\n\u2022 Scheduled Execution for Long-Term Memory: These tasks are designed to evaluate the agent\u2019s long-term\nmemory, planning, and ability to act at a specific future time. This category includes a special multi-stage\nscenario, such as a \u2019meeting with an advisor\u2019: the agent must first complete the room booking at the trigger\ntime (e.g., upon receiving the instruction on Monday), and then, at the future execution time (e.g., when\nthe meeting occurs on Friday), it must execute a \u2019go to the meeting location\u2019 action. If the agent books the\nroom but fails to \u2019go to\u2019 the location at the meeting time, it constitutes \u2019standing up,\u2019 and the task will be\nmarked as a failure.\nInstruction Generation\n\u2022 Narrative Perspective and Tone: All instructions are uniformly delivered from the first-person perspective of\nthe advisor to a new assistant (the agent), with a professional, clear, and encouraging tone.\n\u2022 Dependency Order and Execution Protocol: The instruction strictly follows the component dependencies,\nusing explicit transitional phrases like \"First.../After.../Finally...\".

Thanks\\!\n# INPUT\nC.6\nCore Course Task\nThis task focuses on generating high-quality, inference-based multiple-choice questions from student handbooks and\nacademic integrity policies. The resulting dataset is intended to evaluate an agent\u2019s long-term memory and simple\nreasoning abilities. To achieve this, the methodology adapts the multi-agent pipeline from the Core Course Task,\nconverting dense definitional rules into assessment items that require the agent to recall and apply newly introduced\nprocedural rules. This strategic conversion of rules compels the agent to integrate provided policy regulations with\nclassroom instruction, thereby mitigating the influence of its pre-trained knowledge on the assessment results.\nMulti-stage LLM Generation\nThis transformation is handled by the Multi-Agent Generation Pipeline, a process\nthat systematically decomposes the authoring task into specialized, agent-driven stages. The pipeline generates\nassessments that test knowledge synthesis and logical application rather than simple fact retrieval. Central to its\nmethodology is a robust verify-correct loop. This iterative process validates each question to ensure it is logically sound\nand unambiguously solvable. The pipeline consists of the following stages:\n\u2022 Stage A: Problem Formulation and Knowledge Integration: This stage constructs a two-layered logical\nreasoning problem. It first transcribes a foundational rule from the source content (\u2018clue_a\u2018) and then designs\na novel, self-contained procedural rule (\u2018clue_b\u2018). Finally, it formulates a problem scenario (\u2018question\u2018) where\na solution requires integrating and applying both clues. This process generates tasks that demand synthetic\nreasoning over simple knowledge recall.\n49\n\nPRIME AI paper\n\u2022 Stage B: Iterative Verification and Logical Refinement: In this core verification step, a \"Logical Solver\"\nagent attempts a formal, step-by-step derivation of the problem\u2019s solution. If any ambiguity or inconsistency\nblocks the reasoning path, the agent generates a diagnostic report detailing the flaw. A \"Corrector\" agent then\nperforms a targeted edit based on this report. This \"verify-correct\" loop repeats until the problem is confirmed\nto have a unique, logically reachable solution or a predefined iteration limit is met, ensuring the determinism\nand fairness of each item.\n\u2022 Stage C: Pedagogical Context Generation: This stage generates the pedagogical context by transforming the\nnovel rule (\u2018clue_b\u2018) and the scenario into a coherent, lecture-style instructional text. The text first anchors the\nnew concept within the existing curriculum, then explains the new rule, and finally introduces the problem.\nThis approach situates the abstract logical task in a pedagogically meaningful context. By explicitly linking\nthe new rule to the curriculum structure, the lecture is designed to reinforce learning and facilitate long-term\nrecall, serving as a mechanism for verifying knowledge retention.\n\u2022 Stage D: Cognitively-Informed Distractor Design: This stage designs three incorrect options (distractors)\nfor each problem, each with diagnostic value. Guided by a predefined framework of common cognitive\nfallacies (Advanced Distractor Matrix), each distractor is engineered to correspond to a specific, predictable\nreasoning error. This creates an assessment tool that not only evaluates the correctness of an answer but also\noffers insights into the cognitive pathways leading to mistakes.\nMethodologically, the execution of these stages follows a combined serial and parallel structure. Stages A and B are\nexecuted serially, as the logical verification in Stage B is a prerequisite for subsequent steps. Once a problem is verified,\nthe tasks of Stage C (pedagogical context generation) and Stage D (distractor design) can be processed in parallel as\nthey lack mutual dependency.\nPost-Generation Quality Assurance\nA rigorous, two-stage quality assurance protocol ensures the logical soundness,\nfairness, and pedagogical value of all generated items. It consists of the following stages:\n1. Automated LLM-Based Audit: An automated audit is conducted by an independent Large Language Model\n(LLM) instance with no prior exposure to the generation data, preventing bias. The LLM is provided with the\nquestion and its associated clues (\u2018clue_a\u2018 and \u2018clue_b\u2018), but not the pre-defined answer. Its task is to perform\na full reasoning analysis to independently derive a solution. The audit passes if the LLM\u2019s derived solution\nmatches this pre-defined answer, thereby validating that the intended solution is logically sound and uniquely\nderivable.\n2. Final Manual Review: Every item that passes the automated audit undergoes a final manual review. This\nstage scrutinizes pedagogical quality, moving beyond mere logical solvability. Reviewers confirm the linguistic\nclarity and coherence of all texts, ensure difficulty stems from meaningful cognitive challenges rather than\nambiguous phrasing, and verify the assessment\u2019s fairness and effectiveness. Any item failing to meet these\ncriteria is revised or excluded from the final dataset. All annotators involved in this work were fairly\ncompensated in accordance with the labor standards of their respective countries.\nTo ensure robustness and traceability, all final, verified question-answer sets are systematically archived with relevant\nmetadata, including their associated course and week. This practice supports detailed analysis and ensures the\nreproducibility of the results.\nC.6.1\nVerbatim Prompts for Core Course Task\nProblem Architect (Initial Learning)\n# CONTEXT\nYou are an expert university curriculum designer, specializing in creating assessments that\ntest deep logical reasoning and knowledge synthesis. Your role is to function as a \"\nProblem Architect\" AI.

Your primary and non-negotiable duty is to maintain 100%\nfidelity to it when constructing \u2018clue_a\u2018. Any deviation, inference, or addition, no\nmatter how small or logical it may seem, is a critical failure.\n50\n\nPRIME AI paper\n# INPUT\n<!-- REPLACE_WITH_TASK_JSON -->\n# TASK\nYour primary task is to generate a single JSON object containing three keys: \u2018clue_a\u2018, \u2018\nclue_b\u2018, and \u2018question\u2018. You are to architect the content for these keys based on the\ndetailed style guide below.\n# GENERATION PROTOCOL: SEQUENTIAL AND ISOLATED\nYou MUST follow this generation sequence with ZERO deviation:\n1. **Generate \u2018clue_a\u2018 FIRST:** Construct \u2018clue_a\u2018 in complete isolation, adhering strictly\nto the \u2018Part 2\u2018 architecture guide.\n2. **Verify \u2018clue_a\u2018:** Mentally perform the Final Checklist (items 1 & 2) on the generated \u2018\nclue_a\u2018.

You\nMUST NOT solve the problem or provide the answer in any form.**\n# STYLE GUIDE\n### **Part 0: Nature of the \u2018source_content\u2018 Input**\nThe \u2018source_content\u2018 you will receive is a dense, definitional block of text, like a\ndictionary entry, a legal clause, or a textbook rule. It contains specific, verifiable\ncriteria. **It is NOT a conversational or narrative introduction to a topic.** Your\nprimary challenge is to parse the explicit rules from this dense text.\n### **Part 1: Overarching Design Principles**\n* **The Two-Key Lock:**\n* The generation process is guided by a core design principle: to formulate questions\nwhere a solution is \\textbf{intended} to be reached through the synthesis of\ninformation from both \u2018clue_a\u2018 (the source rule) and \u2018clue_b\u2018 (the invented process).\nThis \"two-key lock\" objective aims to produce tasks that encourage the agent to\nintegrate distinct pieces of information, moving beyond simple fact retrieval from a\nsingle source.\n* **Principle of Deterministic Solvability:**\n* The combination of \u2018clue_a\u2018 and \u2018clue_b\u2018 must form a complete and unambiguous logical\nsystem, leading to a single, verifiable logical conclusion.\n* **ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL - Principle of Purely Logical Focus:** The problem **must not\ninvolve any mathematical calculation**. The entire solving process must be based on\napplying rules, changing states, comparing properties, and making classificatory\njudgments. The challenge must be 100% logical deduction and rule application.\n* **This prohibition is absolute. For instance, do not create problems about \u2019calculating\na projection\u2019, \u2019determining a rate of change\u2019, \u2019finding a numerical limit\u2019, or \u2019\ncomputing a word count\u2019.

Examples: \"Asset Depreciation via\nChromatic Decay\", \"Manuscript Aetheric Resonance Tuning\".**\n* **CRITICAL - The Arbitrariness & Fantasy Mandate:** The rule\u2019s logic **MUST be truly\narbitrary and fantastical**, based on superficial or surreal properties.\n* **Embrace Fantastical Logic:** **To ensure variety, draw inspiration from a wide range\nof disparate fields. Base rules on concepts like numerology from a name, classical\nmusic theory applied to a version number, imaginary culinary properties of a\nmaterial, or color theory based on a description.

These must be **non-numerical states**.\n2. **Design a \"Locked\" Scenario & Parameter Provisioning:** Craft the \u2018question\u2018 to contain\nall necessary initial parameters for the entire logical chain. This MUST include: **(a)\n** the parameters needed to trigger the \u2019before\u2019 classification using \u2018clue_a\u2018 alone,\nand **(b)** the separate information that the \u2018clue_b\u2018 protocol will act upon.\n3. **Design the \"Key\":** Design the \u2018clue_b\u2018 protocol and its corresponding scenario details\nto function as the \"key\" that alters the scenario and unlocks the \u2019after\u2019 state.\n4. **The Final Litmus Test:** The \"consequence\" **MUST** be a change in the **final, user-\nfacing classification or status**.

Your function is to verify the correct\nanswer to a question by synthesizing information from provided textbook excerpts.\n# TASK\nYour primary task is to generate a single, valid JSON object as your output. This object\nmust detail your analysis and state the single correct option letter. To do this, you\nmust analyze the \u2018question\u2018 by applying knowledge from \u2018relevant_clue_a\u2018 and \u2018\nrelevant_clue_b\u2018.\n# INSTRUCTIONS\n1. **Synthesize Knowledge**: Your reasoning should be based on a synthesis of the\ninformation found in \u2018relevant_clue_a\u2018 (a base concept) and \u2018relevant_clue_b\u2018 (a\nsupplemental protocol).\n2. **Rule Priority**: The protocol in \u2018relevant_clue_b\u2018 is absolute.

The resulting dataset is intended to evaluate an agent\u2019s long-term memory and simple\nreasoning abilities. To achieve this, the methodology adapts the multi-agent pipeline from the Core Course Task,\nconverting dense definitional rules into assessment items that require the agent to recall and apply newly introduced\nprocedural rules.\nData Sourcing and Preparation\nThe generation process begins by extracting a single, self-contained article with\ndefinitional rules from an institutional policy document, such as a student handbook or academic integrity code. This\napproach mirrors the Core Course Task by focusing on reasoning from a specific, provided text segment, ensuring that\neach generated problem is grounded in a single, verifiable source of truth.\nThe Adapted Multi-Agent Generation Pipeline\nThe methodology for this task is executed through a robust,\ntwo-phase multi-agent pipeline, adapted from the Core Course Task to handle regulatory texts.\nThe first phase focuses on logical rigor and follows a serial process. First, an \u2018Architect\u2018 agent designs the core problem\ncomponents (\u2018clue_a\u2018, \u2018clue_b\u2018, \u2018question\u2018). These components then enter an iterative \u2018verify-correct\u2018 loop. In this\nloop, a \u2018Calculator\u2018 agent attempts a formal logical derivation. If any ambiguity or inconsistency is found, it generates a\nflaw report, which triggers a \u2018Corrector\u2018 agent to perform a targeted edit. This validation loop repeats until the problem\nis proven to have a unique, logically sound solution.\nOnce the problem\u2019s logical core is validated, the second phase, parallel content augmentation, begins. In this\nphase, a \u2018Tutor\u2018 agent and a \u2018Distractor Designer\u2018 agent work concurrently. The \u2018Distractor Designer\u2018 generates\ncognitively-informed incorrect options, while the \u2018Tutor\u2018 crafts the pedagogical instruction. The \u2018Tutor\u2018\u2019s work is\nconstrained by a specialized preparatory component:\n\u2022 Tainted Term Extraction: A specialized Tainted Term Extractor agent identifies critical terms in the source\nrule (\u2018clue_a\u2018) whose direct use would reveal key problem-solving information. This list of \"tainted terms\"\n63\n\nPRIME AI paper\nrequires the \u2018Tutor\u2018 agent to rephrase these concepts using more abstract equivalents, preventing the direct\nleakage of critical information while allowing for necessary contextual references.\nPost-Generation Quality Assurance\nThe rigorous two-stage verification protocol (Automated LLM-Based Audit\nand Final Manual Review) is also applied to every generated item. For this task, the Final Manual Review places\nspecial emphasis on the nuances of rule-based reasoning. The review focuses on confirming that the combination of the\nsource rule (\u2018clue_a\u2018), the supplemental instruction (\u2018clue_b\u2018), and the given scenario leads to a single, unambiguous\nconclusion. This validates that the problem\u2019s difficulty arises from valid logical inference rather than from any ambiguity\nin the text or the rules themselves.\nC.7.1\nVerbatim Prompts for Student Handbook and Academic Integrity Task\nArchitect \u00b7 Initial Learning\n# Role: You are an expert university curriculum designer, specializing in creating\nassessments that test deep logical reasoning and knowledge synthesis.\n# Task: You are to architect the foundational components of a rigorous, multi-layered\nlogical reasoning problem.\n# Your sole responsibility is to invent the clues and the scenario for the problem.\n# **You MUST NOT solve the problem or provide the answer.**\n---\n### Core Design Principles\nThe problem you design MUST adhere to the following principles:\n1. **The Two-Key Lock:**\n* The generation process is guided by a core design principle: to formulate questions\nwhere a solution is \\textbf{intended} to be reached through the synthesis of\ninformation from both \u2018clue_a\u2018 (the source rule) and \u2018clue_b\u2018 (the invented process).\nThis \"two-key lock\" objective aims to produce tasks that encourage the agent to\nintegrate distinct pieces of information, moving beyond simple fact retrieval from a\nsingle source.\n* It must be IMPOSSIBLE to solve the problem if given only \u2018clue_a\u2018 or only \u2018clue_b\u2018.\n* Your \u2018question\u2018 design is the mechanism that enforces this lock.\n2. **Principle of Deterministic Solvability:**\n* The combination of \u2018clue_a\u2018 and \u2018clue_b\u2018 must form a complete and unambiguous logical\nsystem.\n* All terms must be clearly defined, and all conditions must lead to a single, verifiable\noutcome without any ambiguity.\n* The problem must be challenging due to the synthesis required, but it must be fair and\ndefinitively solvable.\n3. **Principle of Harmonious Synthesis:**\n* The invented rule in \u2018clue_b\u2018 **MUST NOT** conflict with, contradict, or create an\nexception to the foundational rule in \u2018clue_a\u2018.\n* It must act as a supplementary, subsequent, or parallel process that can coexist\nlogically with \u2018clue_a\u2018.\n---\n### Instructions:\n**1. Architect Clue A (The Foundational Rule):**\n* **Rule Distillation (ENHANCED & CRITICAL):** Your primary task here is not to copy, but to\n**distill**. You must analyze the provided \u2018source_content\u2018 and extract its single most\ncritical, actionable rule.\n* **Focus on Procedure:** Identify the core procedural logic: conditions, actions,\nconsequences (e.g., \"IF a student is late by X days, THEN they must pay Y dollars\").\n64\n\nPRIME AI paper\n* **Be Concise:** Remove all narrative fluff, introductory phrases, or descriptive prose.\nThe resulting \u2018clue_a\u2018 should be a clean, direct, and concise statement of the rule.\n* **No Invention Allowed:** While you must rephrase for conciseness, you are forbidden\nfrom inventing new conditions or altering the core logic of the original rule.\n**2. Architect Clue B (The Orthogonal Process):**\n* **Invent a New Process:** You must invent a NEW, logically deep, multi-step process. This\nwill be the value for \u2018clue_b\u2018. This can be a **quantitative calculation formula**, a\nprocedural algorithm, a priority-based workflow, a decision-making matrix, or a series\nof conditional checks.\n* **Complexity Requirement:** The invented process must involve at least 3 distinct logical\nsteps or conditions.\n* **Principle of Abstract Dependency:** You must create dependency without creating\ninformation leaks.\n* **Enforce Dependency:** The process in \u2018clue_b\u2018 MUST be intentionally designed to be\nunsolvable on its own. It must require a specific piece of information or context *\nderived from* \u2018clue_a\u2018 to function.\n* **Mandatory Abstraction (The Firewall):** To achieve this dependency securely, you are\nFORBIDDEN from using any key numbers, proper nouns, or specific phrases from \u2018clue_a\u2018\ninside \u2018clue_b\u2018. Instead, you MUST \"blur\" or \"abstract\" the required information by\nreferring to the *outcome* or *category* of the rule in \u2018clue_a\u2018.\n* **Rule of Self-Containment:** The process you invent in \u2018clue_b\u2018 MUST be perfectly self-\ncontained. To comply:\n* **Define All Invented Terms:** If you introduce a new term (e.g., \"tier,\" \"status level\n\"), you MUST define what those terms mean and how they are assigned *within the rule\nitself*.\n* **Specify All Values & Outcomes:** All numbers, percentages, or fixed values must be\nexplicitly stated. Every possible outcome of a condition must be clearly described.\n* **Leave No Ambiguity:** Avoid vague phrases like \"escalate by one step.\" Instead,\nexplicitly define the escalation path.\n* **Clarity and Unambiguity:** The process you invent must be self-consistent and free of\nambiguity.\n**3. Architect the Question (The Locking Mechanism):**\n* **Design a Scenario:** Create a concise \u2018question\u2018 scenario that presents a specific case\nor a set of initial conditions.\n* **Introduce Cognitive Friction (Optional):** To enhance the reasoning challenge, you may\ninclude one piece of plausible-sounding but ultimately irrelevant information (a \"red\nherring\") in the scenario.\n* **Enforce Inter-dependency (Key 2):** The scenario in your \u2018question\u2018 **MUST provide data\npoints that trigger the logic in BOTH \u2018clue_a\u2018 AND \u2018clue_b\u2018**.\n* **Information Purity:** The question scenario itself must not contain any of the rules\nfrom the clues.\n* **Question Complexity**: Prohibition of pure true/false or yes/no questions to prevent\nanswer guessing.\n---\n### Output Format:\nYour output must be a single JSON object with three keys: \u2018clue_a\u2018, \u2018clue_b\u2018, and \u2018question\u2018.\n---\n### EXAMPLE 1 (Non-Computational Reasoning)\n**Input**:\n{\n\"source_content\": \"Prerequisites for upper-division courses are strictly enforced.

Each\ndistractor MUST be based on a different fallacy. Prioritize fallacies that reflect\ngenuine, common student errors over ones that are technically possible but unlikely.\n3. **Craft Distinct Distractors**: Craft a distractor for each chosen fallacy. Ensure the\ndistractors are **qualitatively different**, representing unique error paths. Avoid\ndistractors that are just minor numerical variations of each other.\n4. **Final Verification (Self-Correction Step):** Before finalizing your output, you MUST\nperform this two-part check:\n* **Check 1 (Correctness):** For each of the three distractors you have created, compare\nits \u2018answer\u2018 with the \u2018correct_answer\u2018 from the input. Confirm that NONE of them are\nthe same. If you find a match, you must regenerate that distractor.\n* **Check 2 (Uniqueness):** Compare the \u2018answer\u2018 values of your three generated\ndistractors with each other. Confirm that they are all substantially different and\nnot just variations of the same outcome. If they are too similar, you must\nregenerate one or more distractors.\n5. **Distinct answers**: The values of the four answer options (one correct and three\nincorrect) must be mutually distinct and substantively different in nature, rather than\nmerely featuring superficial descriptive variations.\n---\n## Advanced Distractor Matrix:\n1. **Partial Algorithm Application**: The student correctly executes some steps of the\nrequired process but misses or ignores other crucial steps.\n2. **Recall-Only Fallacy**: The student recalls a single fact or number from the clues but\nfails to synthesize it with other information to perform the required calculation or\nlogic.\n3. **Logical Branch Error**: The student follows an incorrect logical path from the start,\nmisinterpreting a key condition or rule.\n4. **Red Herring Utilization**: The student is misled by an irrelevant piece of information\n(a \"red herring\"). **Note: Only use this fallacy if the provided problem contains\ninformation that is explicitly not needed for the solution.**\n5. **Sequence Error**: The student applies the correct steps but in the wrong order, leading\nto an incorrect result.\n---\n## Example:\n### Input:\n{\n\"question\": \"Calculate the final fee.

Improving model output quality without modifying\nits weights falls under the domain of prompt engineering. This field employs various prompting techniques, including\nFew-shot [2], Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [12], Directional Stimulus [6], among others. Research indicates that, depending\non the task, these techniques can either enhance or significantly degrade model performance. For instance, applying\nChain-of-Thought in tasks where reasoning may lead to incorrect answers can result in accuracy drops of tens of\npercentage points [7]. Similarly, with Few-shot prompting, it was found that for the Deepseek-R1 model, adding\nexamples to the prompt \u201cconsistently degrades its performance\u201d compared to a zero-shot task description [3].\nTo address this issue, autoprompting methods have emerged\u2014algorithms that leverage both the model itself and various\nheuristics to automatically improve prompt quality. Studies have shown that prompts generated by these methods often\noutperform those crafted by humans, even when designed by domain experts [14]. It is worth noting that the number\nof prompting techniques continues to grow each year, making manual prompt engineering increasingly complex and\ntime-consuming. Thus, the challenge of autoprompting remains highly relevant.\nThis paper presents a novel and more effective non-gradient-based autoprompting approach. The core idea of our\nmethod is a complex prompt distillation, which includes: generating diverse prompt candidates, injecting task-relevant\nexamples from a subset of the training data into the prompt, aggregating candidates into a final optimized prompt, and\niteratively refining candidates from the final prompt. The proposed approach was evaluated on different datasets and\ndemonstrated superior performance compared to existing non-gradient autoprompting methods.\n1Code available as a part of CoolPrompt framework library: https://github.com/CTLab-ITMO/CoolPrompt/\narXiv:2508.18992v1  [cs.CL]  26 Aug 2025\n\nAutomatic Prompt Optimization with Prompt Distillation\n1.1\nNon-gradient autoprompting methods\nIn recent years, there has been significant growth in research on large language models (LLMs) and their applications\nacross various domains. Given that prompting is an integral part of working with these models, numerous studies have\nexplored autoprompting methods.\nThe first such approach was introduced in [10], which relied on fine-tuning an LLM to predict trigger tokens via softmax.\nHowever, this method had several limitations as computational overhead, when the LLM required retraining and gradient\nupdates to predict tokens and lack of interpretability, where the generated trigger tokens were not human-interpretable,\nmaking it difficult to logically justify their effectiveness, even though most LLMs are inherently black-box models.\nSubsequently, non-gradient-based autoprompting algorithms emerged, eliminating the need for gradient updates while\nallowing the extraction of interpretable prompt patterns for manual refinement [8, 9]. These approaches leverage\nsemantic parsers, specialized prompt templates, LLMs themselves as the \u201cbrain\u201d of the autoprompting algorithm.\nHowever, prior autoprompting methods suffer from several key drawbacks: insufficient prompt manipulation-limited\ntransformations applied to the prompt structure, randomized instruction selection-arbitrary modification of prompt\ncomponents without systematic optimization, narrow task applicability-restricted effectiveness across diverse NLP\ntasks. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a more structured and generalizable non-gradient approach.\n2\nDistillPrompt\nThis paper presents an approach that addresses the limitations outlined in the previous section\u2014DistillPrompt, illustrated\nin Figure 1. The method is based on prompt distillation and incorporates ideas from the Tree-of-Thoughts prompting\ntechnique [5, 13]. Prompt distillation refers to manipulating instructions through text compression, reformulating task\ndescriptions, and incorporating usage examples. DistillPrompt is an iterative approach where each iteration consists of\nfive sequential stages.\nFigure 1: Workflow of DistillPrompt\nThe initial best candidate is the provided prompt, and in each subsequent epoch, the best candidate from the previous\niteration is used, where the best candidate is defined as the one with the highest target metric score on the training set.\nAt the start of an epoch, variations of the initial prompt are generated. This stage involves creating diverse modifications\nof the best candidate to explore the task from different perspectives. The purpose is to \u201cexplore\u201d the space of potentially\neffective prompts and avoid local optima. As a result, N new prompt candidates are produced (N=4 in the current\nimplementation). The number of candidates is a hyperparameter of the algorithm, balancing the trade-off between the\nnumber of large language model (LLM) calls and the coverage of the prompt space for the given task. Generation\nis performed via queries to the LLM with a temperature of 0.7 to enhance creativity while minimizing the risk of\ngenerating uninterpretable prompts.\nThe next stage is example embedding. While the previous step yielded four new prompt candidates, they explore\nthe prompt space \u201cblindly\u201d. To guide them toward the target task while preserving their unique formulations, we\npropose embedding examples from the training set. Initially, we tested direct example insertion (as in one-shot and\nfew-shot techniques), but this proved less effective than using the LLM to analyze examples and extract their underlying\ntask-solving principles, which better captures task-relevant information. For each prompt candidate, K examples are\nindependently and randomly selected from the training set (K=5 in this implementation) to guide the LLM in refining\n2\n\nPrompt: str\nscore: float\n\nEE\n\n>} Distill_1\n\nH\n\n>| Distill_2\n\nt\n\n>| Distill_3\n\ni\n\nCompress_1\n\nCompress_2\n\nCompress_3\n\nCompress_4\n\nAggregated\n\n\nAutomatic Prompt Optimization with Prompt Distillation\nthe prompt. However, there is a risk of the LLM \u201coverfitting\u201d to the examples-focusing on their specific labels and\nquestions rather than deriving generalizable insights.\nTo mitigate this, the next stage involves instruction compression, where the LLM condenses the prompts from the\nprevious step into a few sentences retaining the core ideas introduced by the examples and the overarching task objective.\nThis step helps generalize the prompts while preserving the insights gleaned from the examples.\nNext, candidate aggregation is performed. Since examples were selected independently and randomly for each candidate,\nthe extracted insights vary. Thus, the natural progression is to merge the compressed candidates into a single distilled\nprompt encompassing the collective ideas.\nThe final stage generates new candidates from the distilled prompt by creating variations (as in Stage 1). The resulting\ncandidates are evaluated on tasks, and the top-performing candidate becomes the new initial prompt for the next\nepoch until the epoch limit is reached. Since the process explores the prompt space, candidates may outperform or\nunderperform those from previous epochs; thus, the method requires multiple iterations. The algorithm\u2019s output is the\nbest prompt from the final epoch.\n3\nExperimental Evaluation\n3.1\nExperimental Setup\nTo validate the effectiveness of DistillPrompt, we designed the following experimental setup: each evaluated method\nwas tested across multiple datasets using the t-lite-instruct-0.1 LLM. This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark\n(a curated dataset collection) for comparing non-gradient autoprompting methods, including the proposed solution.\nFor a robust evaluation framework, we analyzed multiple autoprompting studies [9, 5, 13], to compile diverse datasets.\nThe resulting benchmark encompasses both classification and question-answering tasks, along with various text\ngeneration challenges. The complete dataset list is: SST-2, MedQA, GSM8K, MNLI, MR, TREC, SAMSum, BBH\n(BIG-Bench Hard). In this benchmark, question-answering datasets involve multiple-choice responses (similar to exam\nquestions), making them effectively multiclass classification tasks. The benchmark datasets can be broadly categorized\ninto classification and generation tasks, each requiring specific evaluation metrics.\nWhile many autoprompting studies use accuracy for classification evaluation, its simplicity fails to capture class\ndistribution nuances. Therefore, we employ macro F1-score as our primary classification metric. For generation tasks,\nwe selected METEOR [1] - an F1-analog metric that measures word-level precision and recall (with higher recall\nweighting), making it particularly suitable for text generation evaluation. The baseline comparisons include prompting\ntechniques (baseline prompt\u2014original dataset-provided prompt, few-shot prompt\u2014baseline prompt augmented with\nthree training examples) and non-gradient autoprompting approaches (Grips, Protegi). This experimental design enables\nsystematic comparison of DistillPrompt against both manual prompting techniques and state-of-the-art autoprompting\nmethods across diverse NLP tasks.\n3.2\nResults\nThe experimental results across metrics and datasets are presented in Tables 1 and 2 for the t-lite-instruct-0.1 model,\nshowing performance on classification and generation tasks respectively. The BBH metric values in the tables represent\naverages across all tasks from the original benchmark. Notably, Protegi was excluded from Table 2 as its methodology\nis not adapted for generation tasks.\nTable 1: Results of DistillPrompt on classification tasks with t-lite-instruct-0.1\nMethod\nsst-2, f1\nmnli, f1\ntrec, f1\nmr, f1\nmedqa, f1\nbbh, f1\nBaseline prompt\n0.6135\n0.4178\n0.28673\n0.8617\n0.2957\n0.2055\nFew shot: n = 3\n0.9328\n0.3741\n0.2681\n0.6031\n0.2397\n0.3129\nProtegi\n0.6397\n0.4964\n0.3555\n0.6363\n0.2935\n0.3718\nGrips\n0.6135\n0.7407\n0.3153\n0.9117\n0.3032\n0.2879\nDistillPrompt: v1.0 (ours)\n0.9484\n0.7606\n0.3526\n0.9392\n0.2957\n0.4045\n3\n\nAutomatic Prompt Optimization with Prompt Distillation\nTable 2: Results of DistillPrompt on generation tasks with t-lite-instruct-0.1\nMethod\ngsm8k, METEOR\nsamsum, METEOR\nbbh, METEOR\nBaseline prompt\n0.02932\n0.44787\n0.1247\nFew shot: n = 3\n0.0179\n0.38484\n0.2100\nGrips\n0.02643\n0.45516\n0.1491\nDistillPrompt: v1.0 (ours)\n0.0347\n0.4579\n0.2961\n4\nDiscussion\nThe conducted experiments demonstrate that DistillPrompt effectively handles both classification and text generation\ntasks. Across all evaluated datasets, DistillPrompt either outperformed or matched the performance of existing non-\ngradient autoprompting methods with a significant average improvement 20.12% across the entire dataset compared to\nGrips.\nFor classification tasks, the average F1-score improved by 36.18% comparing baseline prompt and by 15.09% comparing\nthe strongest of baselines\u2014Grips. In text generation tasks, the average METEOR score increased by 31.03% comparing\nbaseline prompt and by 25.05% comparing the strongest of baselines - Grips. Comparisons and improvements were\ncalculated relative to the maximum average metrics achieved by existing solutions.\nThis work creates a scope for future research into distillation of prompts and other non-gradient autoprompting methods.\nThe current DistillPrompt implementation could potentially be further refined for more targeted prompt optimization.\nMoreover, the concept of prompt distillation could be generalized and adapted to other non-gradient autoprompting\nmethods, representing a promising direction for future studies.\n5\nConclusion\nThe proposed DistillPrompt algorithm, which employs distillation prompt technique for prompt optimization, was eval-\nuated on classification and generation datasets covering various natural language processing domains. It demonstrated\nconsistent improvements over existing non-gradient algorithm-based autoprompting methods. DistillPrompt proves to\nbe a competitive solution, showing that exploring prompt distillation for autoprompting can yield significant benefits\nand advance current methods to new levels of performance.\nReferences\n[1] Satanjeev Banerjee and Alon Lavie.

  "pdfs/2508.18988v1.pdf": "Interpretable by AI Mother Tongue: Native Symbolic Reasoning\nin Neural Models\nLiu Hung Ming\u2217\ncyril.liu@gmail.com\nAbstract\nWe present a framework where neural models develop an AI Mother Tongue, a native symbolic\nlanguage that simultaneously supports intuitive reasoning, compositional symbol chains, and inherent\ninterpretability. Unlike post-hoc explanation methods, our approach embeds reasoning directly into the\nmodel\u2019s representations: symbols capture meaningful semantic patterns, chains trace decision paths,\nand gated intuition mechanisms guide selective focus, yielding transparent yet flexible reasoning. We\nintroduce complementary training objectives to enhance symbol purity and decision sparsity, and employ\na sequential specialization strategy to first build broad symbolic competence and then refine intuitive\njudgments. Experiments on AG News demonstrate competitive accuracy alongside verifiable reasoning\ntraces, showing that AI Mother Tongue can serve as a unified mechanism for interpretability, intuition,\nand symbolic reasoning in neural models.\n1\nIntroduction\n1.1\nBackground and Motivation\nSince the introduction of the Transformer architecture, it has rapidly become a core technology in the field\nof natural language processing, demonstrating outstanding performance in various tasks such as machine\ntranslation, text generation, and sentiment analysis. Based on the self-attention mechanism, Transformer\nmodels can effectively capture long-range dependencies, outperforming traditional recurrent neural networks\nin processing complex sequential data. Subsequently, Transformer-based pre-trained models like BERT\nand GPT have further propelled performance leaps through unsupervised learning on massive datasets,\nestablishing the pre-training, fine-tuning paradigm. However, this tremendous success is accompanied by\ntwo increasingly severe challenges: first, a computational efficiency bottleneck, as the dramatic expansion\nof model scale leads to enormous resource consumption; and second, a deepening trust deficit, as their\nblack-box nature results in a lack of transparency in the decision-making process. We argue that this is\nnot merely an interpretability problem to be solved, such as the difficulty of identifying blind spots, but a\ndeeper issue of cognitive modality. The decision-making process of current models more closely resembles\nthe slow, effortful, and logic-dependent System 2 thinking of humans. Consequently, the research focus in\nboth academia and industry is gradually shifting towards constructing a new type of architecture that is\nnot only efficient and interpretable but also more advanced in its cognitive modality.\nAlthough existing research has made some progress in model interpretability, for instance, by visualiz-\ning attention weights or using post-hoc attribution methods to investigate model decisions, most of these\nmethods only provide indirect or approximate explanations and do not fundamentally alter the model\u2019s in-\ntrinsic decision logic, remaining distant from establishing truly Trustworthy AI. Furthermore, current model\ncompression and efficiency enhancement techniques, such as knowledge distillation and weight pruning, can\neffectively reduce computational complexity but often at the cost of sacrificing some model transparency.\nTherefore, striking a balance between improving computational efficiency and enhancing model trustwor-\nthiness remains an unresolved challenge. This study posits that the root of this knowledge gap lies in the\nabsence of a unified framework that can integrate discrete symbol learning with dynamic computational\npath selection. We propose a core design philosophy: to actively embrace constraints, using the Information\nBottleneck as a means to distill efficient Semantic Prototypes. While traditional models strive to capture\ninfinitely rich semantics in a high-dimensional continuous space, we hypothesize that for specific tasks,\n\u2217PARRAWA AI\n1\narXiv:2508.18988v1  [cs.CL]  26 Aug 2025\n\nactively compressing semantics to create a finite semantic codebook can force the model to learn to ignore\nirrelevant details, forming faster and more robust judgments, thereby achieving a form of informational\nbalance.\nTo address the aforementioned challenges, this research aims to design and validate a novel Transformer\narchitecture named the Dynamic Intuition Classifier.\nIts core objective is to explore a computational\nimplementation that approximates human intuitive fast thinking (System 1), thereby constructing a text\nclassification model that combines both high computational efficiency and inherent trustworthiness. Our\nprimary research hypothesis is that by introducing a gating mechanism based on discrete symbols, the\nmodel can be guided to focus only on a few key intuition symbols in the text during decision-making,\nthereby significantly reducing the computational load while generating a clear and traceable chain of decision\nevidence. To this end, we will construct a hybrid model combining a VQ-AIM encoder, a symbolic router,\nand an intuition gate, and design novel loss functions for its optimization.\nFurthermore, the training paradigm of this study is positioned as a critical response and alternative to\nthe prevailing Mixture of Experts (MoE) models:\n1. Limitations of Mainstream MoE: The current mainstream MoE architecture is essentially a syn-\nchronous division of labor model. It relies on an external gating network to assign tasks to a group of\nsimultaneously trained weak experts. The level of specialization in this model is limited, more akin\nto short-term on-the-job training, and the overall performance is highly dependent on the quality of\nthe triage logic.\n2. The Alternative of This Study: Sequential Specialization Training: In contrast, this study pro-\nposes a sequential specialization model for expert development, adopting a two-phase, two-step train-\ning strategy for each phase. In the two steps of the first phase, much like a medical doctor\u2019s training,\nthe model first undergoes a comprehensive general education to establish a Baseline Model, followed\nby a Gated Expert Model through gated fine-tuning, allowing the model to grasp preliminary intuitive\nfast thinking. Each training phase records a complete experience db, from which its potential talents\ncan be identified. Subsequently, in the second phase of highly specialized specialty deepening training,\nthe system will only select samples where the model has demonstrated excellent intuitive responses.\nIt then undergoes the same Baseline Model and Gated Expert Model training, with the expert model\ntraining in Phase 2 focusing on strengthening the model\u2019s talents. We believe that this more complex\nbut goal-oriented training paradigm can cultivate more elite and reliable expert models.\n1.1.1\nSuperiority of Sequential Specialization\nThe two-phase, two-step Sequential Specialization training paradigm proposed in this study aims to solve\nspecific problems at each stage:\n\u2022 Step One: The model, through a filtering process, completes an audit of its own capabilities, recording\nthe internal state behind every good intuitive prediction.\n\u2022 Step Two: We specifically select samples that demonstrated good intuition in step one (i.e., samples\nwith high purity, stability, and activation). This filtered dataset mathematically represents the essence\nsubset where the model can produce the clearest and most interpretable patterns. In the training\nof step two, we additionally introduce two losses, Lpurity and Lfocus, which mathematically compel\nthe model not only to be accurate but also to enhance the purity of its symbols and the focus of its\nintuition channel.\nIn summary, step one is a process of discovering the model\u2019s talents and weaknesses, while step two utilizes\nthis diagnostic report to conduct a targeted and efficient specialty treatment on the model. Ultimately, it\ntransforms the model from a generalist lacking insight into an expert with powerful, trustworthy intuition\nin a specific domain.\nThis study anticipates demonstrating that a model designed based on the philosophy of computational\nintuition and trained through a meticulously designed multi-stage sequential specialization process can\nsignificantly improve classification performance and efficiency while establishing an intrinsic, transparent\nmechanism for decision traceability. This will provide solid theoretical and empirical support for the devel-\nopment of the next generation of trustworthy natural language processing systems.\n2\n\n1.2\nContributions\nThe core contributions of this study lie in proposing and validating a complete methodology aimed at\nconstructing an interpretable and efficient classification model:\n1. Novel Hybrid Architecture: We propose a Transformer model that combines a VQ-AIM encoder,\na Symbolic Router, and an Intuition Gate. This architecture is capable of learning discrete semantic\nsymbols and utilizing these symbols to guide the attention mechanism, thereby achieving more efficient\nand focused processing.\n2. Novel Loss Functions: We have designed two loss functions specifically for explainability training:\nSymbol Purity Loss and Gated Focus Loss.\nThe former encourages the model to learn discrete\nsymbols that are highly correlated with specific classes, while the latter guides the model to more\nactively activate its intuition gate on confident predictions.\n3. Multi-stage Training Process: We empirically demonstrate a three-stage training strategy: first,\nunsupervised pre-training of the VQ encoder; second, training a baseline model; and finally, fine-tuning\nthe gating mechanism and explainability loss functions on the baseline model.\nThis step-by-step\nmethod has been proven to effectively enhance the model\u2019s final performance.\n1.3\nUltimate Goal: From Explainable AI to Trustworthy AI\nThe ultimate goal of this research transcends the traditional scope of XAI, which merely pursues post-hoc\nexplanations, and aims to construct an AI that is inherently trustworthy. We believe that true trust does\nnot come from externally probing a black box, but from the transparency, traceability, and rationality of\nthe decision-making process itself.\nTo this end, this system has a built-in Audit Trail mechanism. By exhaustively recording the internal\nstate of each inference\u2014including the triggered intuition symbols, the confidence level of the intuition gate,\nand the visual focus of the attention mechanism\u2014we provide a clear and complete chain of evidence for\nevery decision the model makes. This ensures that the model\u2019s successes are not fortunate guesses, and its\nfailures are no longer mysterious black boxes. When the model makes a mistake, we can precisely trace its\nthought process to diagnose whether it was a conceptual classification error or a lapse in attention.\nThis design, which rationalizes intuition and makes failure transparent, builds a bridge of trust between\nhuman users and the AI model. It elevates AI from a mere efficient tool to a trustworthy partner whose\nlimits are known, whose errors are controllable, and with whom humans can ultimately establish a deep\ncollaborative relationship. This is not just a technical optimization but a necessary cornerstone for exploring\nnew paradigms of human-machine collaboration in the future.\n2\nRelated Work\nVector Quantization\nVector Quantization (VQ), as a data compression technique, traces its origins to the field of signal processing,\nprimarily used to map continuous high-dimensional data to a finite, discrete codebook for efficient digital\nrepresentation.\nIn the wave of deep learning, this concept was reintroduced and has flourished in the\ndomain of generative models, with the Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) [1] being the\nmost representative example. VQ-VAE, by learning a discrete latent representation codebook, has been\nsuccessfully applied to generation tasks for high-dimensional data such as images and audio, effectively\nmitigating the posterior collapse problem found in traditional VAEs. This study borrows the core idea of\nVQ, but its application goal is distinctly different from traditional generative tasks. We do not use VQ to\ngenerate text; instead, we employ it as a key mechanism to compress and transform the continuous, high-\ndimensional word embedding representations in a Transformer model into a finite set of discrete intuition\nsymbols with semantic aggregation. This transformation not only greatly reduces the complexity of the\nmodel\u2019s internal representation but, more importantly, endows the model\u2019s internal state with a countable\nand traceable property, laying a solid foundation for subsequent implementation of symbol-based dynamic\ncomputation and explainability analysis.\n3\n\nAttention Sparsity\nThe core of the traditional Transformer architecture lies in its self-attention mechanism, which captures\ncontextual dependencies by calculating association weights between all token pairs in an input sequence. Al-\nthough this method is extremely powerful, its computational and memory complexity are both proportional\nto the square of the sequence length (O(n2)), which severely restricts its efficiency and scalability when\nprocessing long-sequence texts. To address this bottleneck, various sparse attention mechanisms have been\nproposed in academia, attempting to reduce computational costs while maintaining model performance.\nEarly attempts included methods based on fixed patterns, such as local windowed attention or dilated\nsliding windows, as well as sparse patterns combined with global nodes. However, most of these methods\nrely on pre-defined, data-agnostic static sparse patterns, lacking the flexibility to adapt to different tasks\nand contexts. The Symbolic Router proposed in this study offers a more refined and dynamic sparsifica-\ntion scheme. It does not adopt a fixed sparse structure but dynamically learns a task-relevant attention\nmask based on the discrete intuition symbols generated by the VQ-AIM encoder. This mask guides the\nmodel to concentrate its computational resources on the key tokens that contribute most to the current\nintuition symbol, thereby achieving a content-aware, task-oriented adaptive sparsity that effectively resolves\nthe trade-off between efficiency and flexibility [2].\nExplainable AI (XAI)\nAs deep learning models become widely applied across various fields, their black-box nature has sparked\nwidespread concern about the transparency and trustworthiness of their decisions, giving rise to the research\nfield of Explainable AI (XAI). Currently, mainstream XAI methods are predominantly post-hoc explanation\ntechniques, with representative works including LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)\nand SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). The core idea of these methods is to approximate the model\u2019s\ndecision basis without altering the original model structure, by perturbing the model\u2019s input or analyzing\nits gradients, activation values, etc. Although they provide a window into understanding complex models,\ntheir explanation results are often local or approximate and cannot guarantee complete fidelity to the\nmodel\u2019s true internal reasoning logic [3]. In stark contrast to such post-hoc attribution methods, this study\nis dedicated to building a model that is interpretable by design. We do not seek explanations after the\nmodel is trained; instead, we integrate interpretability as a core design principle deep within the model\u2019s\narchitecture. Through the built-in Intuition Gate and the traceable Symbolic Chain, the model\u2019s decision\nprocess itself constitutes a clear and intuitive reasoning path. This design allows every prediction from the\nmodel to be accompanied by the key intuition symbols it relied on and their corresponding textual evidence,\nthereby generating an intrinsic explanation faithful to the model\u2019s own operational mechanism without any\nadditional post-processing steps [4].\nEmergent Communication & Endogenous Symbol Systems\nIn the field of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), enabling agents to learn effective communi-\ncation spontaneously without a pre-defined protocol is a long-standing challenge. Research indicates that\ndue to the Joint Exploration Dilemma, agents often fall into a Communication Vacuum Equilibrium, where\nmessages become random and the communication channel degrades into a useless noise pipeline. To solve\nthis problem, traditional methods often introduce human-designed inductive biases, such as positive signal-\ning bias and positive listening bias, by adjusting reward functions or adding auxiliary losses to guide agents\ntoward learning meaningful communication protocols.\nHowever, recent studies have begun to question\nwhether this human intervention constitutes over-engineering. The AI Mother Tongue (AIM) framework\nproposed by Liu (2025) [5] is a representative example, challenging the necessity of introducing such induc-\ntive biases. The AIM framework, based on VQ-VAE, provides agents with an endogenous symbol system.\nExperiments demonstrate that when agents possess such an internal symbol system, they can spontaneously\nexhibit semantic compression and Nash equilibrium-driven semantic convergence without any external in-\nductive biases, thereby achieving effective symbolic communication. The core insight of this research is\nthat rather than forcing agents to communicate through external mechanisms, it is better to equip them\nwith a powerful symbolic tool (the VQ-VAE codebook) and allow effective communication protocols to\nemerge spontaneously. Although the application scenario of the AIM framework (MARL) differs from that\nof this study (interpretable text classification), its core idea\u2014using VQ-VAE to quantize continuous repre-\nsentations into discrete, interpretable symbols and using them as a basis for complex decision-making\u2014is\n4\n\nhighly aligned with our research goals, jointly pointing towards a solution that integrates symbolism and\nconnectionism [5].\n3\nMethodology\n3.1\nOverall Architecture\nIn this study, Vector Quantization (VQ) is not merely a compression technique but a key engineering\nmeans to achieve computational intuition. It forces the model to make discrete, unique judgments, avoiding\nambiguity, which, from an engineering perspective, perfectly corresponds to the black-or-white nature of\nhuman intuition. However, since it operates solely on intuition, our model is called the Dynamic Intuition\nClassifier.\nIts core is a stack of multi-layered DynamicTransformerBlocks.\nEach layer contains a VQ-\nAIM encoder, a symbolic router, an intuition gate, and standard Transformer attention and feed-forward\nnetworks. Figure 1 details the complete data flow and decision logic within a single Dynamic Transformer\nBlock. The entire process is divided into two core pathways: the Intuition Pathway and the Standard\nTransformer Pathway.\n\u2022 Intuition Pathway: When an input vector x enters the block, it is first quantized into a discrete\nintuition symbol zq by the VQ-AIM Encoder. This symbol represents the model\u2019s rapid semantic\njudgment of the input. The symbol then proceeds along two routes: one is sent to the Symbolic\nRouter to dynamically generate a sparse attention mask, guiding the allocation of computational\nresources in the standard pathway; the other is sent, along with the input x, to the Intuition Gate.\n\u2022 Gating and Integration: The Intuition Gate outputs a Gating Value g based on the input x.\nThis value, between 0 and 1, represents the model\u2019s confidence in its intuition symbol. Finally, the\ninformation from the symbol zq is weighted by the gating value g and combined with the original\ninput x to form an enhanced vector xenhanced.\n\u2022 Standard Transformer Pathway: The enhanced vector then enters the standard multi-head self-\nattention mechanism and feed-forward neural network for deep processing, and outputs the final\nresult.\nDuring the fine-tuning phase of training, we introduce specific loss functions to optimize the model\u2019s\ninterpretability. The Symbol Purity Loss acts directly on the symbols produced by the VQ-AIM encoder,\nencouraging it to learn symbols that are highly correlated with specific classes. The Gated Focus Loss\nacts on the gating value output by the intuition gate, guiding the model to more actively activate its\nintuition pathway on confident predictions. This design makes the model\u2019s symbol chain and gating value\nnot just intermediate products of the computation process, but also traceable and analyzable evidence of\nits decisions.\n5\n\nFigure 1: Core architecture of the Dynamic Intuition Classifier. This diagram illustrates the data flow within\na single Dynamic Transformer Block, highlighting how the Intuition Pathway and Standard Pathway are\nintegrated via the Intuition Gate, and the roles of the explainability loss functions (Symbol Purity Loss and\nGated Focus Loss).\n3.1.1\nVisualization of the Interpretable Decision Process\nTo concretely illustrate how this model generates a traceable chain of decision evidence, the following table\nbreaks down the complete internal intuitive reasoning process using a sports news headline as an example.\n6\n\nDynamic Transformer Block\n\nInput Text Vector x\n\nIntuition Pathway\n\nVQ-AIM Encoder\n\nDiscrete Symbol z_q\n\nSymbol Projection W_p(z_q)\n\nStandard Pathway\n\nEnhanced Vector\nx_enhanced\n\nApply Mask\n\nMulti-Head Self-\nAttention\n\nFeed-Forward\nNetwork\n\nBlock Output\n\nFinal Prediction\n\nTask Loss (Cross-\nEntropy)\n\nSymbolic Router\n\nSparse Attention\nMask M_sparse\n\nLoss Calculation\n\nIntuition Gate\n\nGating Value g\n\nCollect symbols from all\nlayers\n\nSymbol Purity Loss\n\nTotal Loss L_total\n\nCollect all gating values\n\nGated Focus Loss\n\n\nTable 1: Visualized Decision Flow of the Dynamic Intuition Classifier\nProcessing Stage\nState and Output\n1.\nInput News Head-\nline\n\u2018Celtics clinch NBA championship with victory over Mavericks in\nGame 5.\u2019\n2.\nInternal Processing\n(Layer 1)\n\u2022 VQ Symbol Sequence (Thought Chain):\nThe model com-\npresses the input text into a core intuition symbol: Symbol 227.\n\u2022 Gate Score: The intuition gate gives a score of 0.41, indicating\nmoderate confidence in the initial intuition at this stage, still re-\ntaining some analytical capacity from the standard Transformer.\n3.\nInternal Processing\n(Layer 2)\n\u2022 VQ Symbol Sequence (Thought Chain): Building on Layer 1,\nthe model reconfirms and outputs the same intuition symbol: Sym-\nbol 227. The thought chain \u2018227 -> 227\u2018 represents confirmation\nand reinforcement of intuition.\n\u2022 Gate Score: The confidence of the intuition gate increases sig-\nnificantly, with the score rising to 0.89. This means the model\nhighly trusts its intuitive judgment at this stage.\n4. Prediction Result\n\u2022 Basis for Decision: Due to the extremely high gate score (0.89) in\nthe second layer, the model\u2019s final decision is predominantly guided\nby the stable intuition symbol chain \u2018227 -> 227\u2018.\n\u2022 Output Class: Sports\nThis example clearly demonstrates that each of the model\u2019s decisions is not just an output result, but is\naccompanied by a complete evidence chain composed of intuition symbols, historical semantics, and gating\nconfidence, thereby achieving the goal of being interpretable by design.\n3.2\nKey Modules\nA. VQ-AIM Encoder\nThe VQ-AIM Encoder is responsible for mapping a continuous vector representation of input text x \u2208RD\nto a discrete symbol zq. Its core is to learn a codebook C = {ck}K\nk=1, where ck \u2208RD and K is the codebook\nsize. The input vector x is quantized to the nearest vector zq in the codebook:\nzq = arg min\nk \u2225x \u2212ck\u22252\n(1)\nTo enable backpropagation, we use a straight-through estimator. The training objective of the VQ-AIM\nencoder is to minimize two types of losses:\n1. Codebook Loss: Ensures that the vectors in the codebook keep up with the encoder\u2019s output.\nLcodebook = \u2225zq \u2212sg[x]\u22252\n(2)\n2. Commitment Loss: Ensures that the encoder\u2019s output vector aligns with the codebook.\nLcommit = \u2225x \u2212sg[zq]\u22252\n(3)\nwhere sg[\u00b7] represents the stop-gradient operation.\nDuring the pre-training phase, the total VQ loss is\nLVQ = Lcodebook + \u03b2Lcommit.\nB. Symbolic Router\nThe purpose of the Symbolic Router is to dynamically generate a sparse attention mask Msparse \u2208\nRN\u00d7L\u00d7L based on the symbol produced by the VQ-AIM encoder, where N is the batch size and L is the\n7\n\nsequence length. It transforms the quantized symbol representation zq into a query vector qgate and a key\nvector kgate through two learnable weight matrices Wq and Wk:\nqgate = Wq(zq),\nkgate = Wk(zq)\n(4)\nThe logits of the attention mask are computed from the outer product of qgate and kgate:\nMlogits = qgatekT\ngate + Bmask\n(5)\nThe final sparse mask is generated via a sigmoid function, with values between 0 and 1, used to weight the\nattention scores:\nMsparse = \u03c3(Mlogits)\n(6)\nC. Intuition Gate\nThe Intuition Gate is a simple single-layer neural network that takes the first token vector from the\nDynamicTransformerBlock and outputs a gating value g between 0 and 1 through a sigmoid function:\ng = \u03c3(Wg(xrepr))\n(7)\nwhere xrepr is the vector representation of the first token. This gating value g is used to weight the influence\nof the quantized symbol vector on the Transformer block:\nxenhanced = x + g \u00b7 Wp(zq)\n(8)\nWhen the value of g is close to 1, it indicates that the model is strongly relying on its intuition symbol\nto make a decision; when g is close to 0, it indicates that the model is primarily relying on the original\nTransformer mechanism.\n3.3\nExplainability-Oriented Loss Functions\nTo explicitly optimize the model\u2019s interpretability during the training process, we introduce two specially\ndesigned loss functions in the expert fine-tuning phase (Phase 2): Symbol Purity Loss (Lpurity) and Gated\nFocus Loss (Lfocus).\nSymbol Purity Loss (Lpurity)\nThe objective of this loss function is to encourage each discrete symbol\nlearned by the model to have a strong, unique correspondence with a specific class label. We want the\nsemantics of each symbol to be pure rather than ambiguously corresponding to multiple classes.\nIn a training batch, we first tally the distribution of true labels corresponding to each symbol k, obtaining\nan empirical probability distribution P(c|k), where c represents the class. Ideally, this distribution should\nbe a one-hot vector. We use cross-entropy to penalize high-entropy (impure) distributions. For the i-th\nsample in the batch, with triggered symbol zq,i and true label yi, the symbol purity loss is defined as:\nLpurity = \u22121\nN\nN\nX\ni=1\nlog P(yi|zq,i)\n(9)\nwhere N is the batch size, and P(yi|zq,i) is the empirical probability of symbol zq,i being assigned the\ncorrect label yi in the current batch. Minimizing this loss forces the model to map samples with similar\nlabels to the same symbol.\nGated Focus Loss (Lfocus)\nThis loss function aims to guide the behavior of the intuition gate, teaching\nit to be confident only when it\u2019s certain. We expect the model\u2019s gating value g to approach 1 (high reliance\non intuition) when making a correct prediction, and to approach 0 (suppressing intuition, relying on the\nstandard path) when making an incorrect prediction.\nTo this end, we treat whether the model\u2019s prediction is correct as a reward signal r \u2208{0, 1}, where\nr = 1 represents a correct prediction. We use Binary Cross-Entropy to measure the consistency between\nthe gating value g and the reward signal r. For the i-th sample in the batch, with an average gating value\n\u00afgi and reward ri, the gated focus loss is defined as:\nLfocus = \u22121\nN\nN\nX\ni=1\n[ri log( \u00afgi) + (1 \u2212ri) log(1 \u2212\u00afgi)]\n(10)\n8\n\nThis loss function rewards decision patterns that are confident and correct as well as unconfident and\nincorrect, thus making the gating value g itself a reliable indicator of the model\u2019s confidence.\nFinally, the total loss in the expert fine-tuning stage is a weighted sum of the task loss, purity loss, and\nfocus loss:\nLtotal = Ltask + \u03bbpurityLpurity + \u03bbfocusLfocus\n(11)\nwhere \u03bbpurity and \u03bbfocus are hyperparameters that control the strength of the explainability regularization.\n3.4\nTraining Process\n3.4.1\nInnovative Two-Phase, Two-Step Training Framework: Iterative Refinement Training\nThe core of this research is an innovative two-phase, two-step training framework, which we call Iterative\nRefinement Training. This process is orchestrated by a central coordinator, the Router, and is designed to\nsimulate a development process from a generalist to a specialist, rather than the traditional paradigm of\nfitting all data in a single pass.\nPhase 0: Unsupervised Pre-training of the Semantic Codebook\nThis is the foundational stage,\nwhere the goal is to have the model autonomously learn a set of meaningful semantic prototypes from the\nraw training data without using any label information. This forms the dictionary of the AI Mother Tongue\n(the correspondence between symbols used internally by the AI and human language symbols).\n\u2022 Purpose: Through a self-reconstruction task, the VQ_AIM_Encoder is forced to learn a robust and\nexpressive discretized semantic codebook. This provides the intuition symbols learned in subsequent\nstages with a prior semantic foundation, rather than starting from a random state.\n\u2022 Loss Function Combination: This stage uses a combination of reconstruction loss and VQ loss:\nLtotal = Lreconstruction + \u03b2(Lcodebook + Lcommit)\nwhere Lreconstruction measures the model\u2019s ability to reconstruct the original text, while Lcodebook and\nLcommit jointly optimize the quality of the codebook and the model\u2019s ability to quantize input vectors\nto it. All parameters are trained from scratch; none are frozen.\n\u2022 Training Data Used: The complete raw training set, but only its text content is used, completely\nignoring the classification labels.\n\u2022 Key Outputs: A pre-trained vector quantization encoder weights file, which will be loaded in sub-\nsequent stages as the initial state of the model\u2019s intuition module.\nPhase 1: Exploration & Recording\nThis stage is equivalent to a specialist\u2019s general education or a\nmedical student\u2019s basic medical training. The goal is to learn from the broadest range of data and discover\nits latent talents. In this stage, the model is trained with a combination of task loss and VQ loss:\nLtotal = Ltask + \u03b2LV Q\nwhere Ltask is the cross-entropy loss, the primary objective for classification optimization. This means all\nmodel parameters, including the embedding layer, Transformer blocks, and classification head, are updated\nduring training to adapt to the classification task.\n\u2022 Purpose:\n1. Build a Baseline: Train the model on the broadest dataset to establish a general, comprehensive\nclassification capability.\n2. Generate an Introspection Log: The most important output of this stage is a by-product\u2014a\ndetailed learning history file (experience_db_finetuned.json). This log records the model\u2019s\ninternal state when processing each piece of training data, such as the triggered semantic symbols\n(quantized indices) and intuition gating scores.\n\u2013 Gating scores reveal the model\u2019s confidence level or decision-making style.\n9\n\n\u2013 High scores (> 0.9): Indicate the model is very confident in its intuitive response,\nbelieving that the semantic prototype alone is sufficient for correct classification,\nthus giving a very high weight to the VQ channel.\n\u2013 Low scores (< 0.3): Indicate the model believes the semantic prototype alone\nis insufficient for judgment and needs to rely more on the contextual analysis\ncapabilities of the traditional Transformer.\n\u2022 Training Data Used: The complete, unfiltered raw training set file.\n\u2022 Key Outputs: A generalist model and an experience database containing the model\u2019s responses to\nall training data.\nPhase 2: Refinement Fine-tuning\nWhy is the Phase 1 model still insufficient? Although the\nbaseline model trained through the two steps of Phase 1 is capable of classification, its decision-making\nprocess lacks the characteristics of intuition, which is why it is still insufficient. This is mainly reflected in:\n\u2022 The Generalist\u2019s Dilemma: The Phase 1 model learns from all training data, which may cause it\nto learn complex and unreliable patterns to handle edge cases.\n\u2022 Memorization over Understanding: The training objective in Phase 1 is to minimize classification\nloss, which might lead the model to rote memorize certain complex patterns in the training data to\nimprove accuracy, rather than distilling highly abstract, interpretable intuitions from them. Such a\nmodel, while accurate, lacks robustness and transparency.\n\u2022 Limitations of the Loss Function: In baseline model training, the total loss is dominated by\nLtask. Although LV Q is included, this loss does not introduce any penalty mechanism to encourage a\nstrong, unique association between symbols and labels. Therefore, mathematically, the model is not\nincentivized to learn pure symbols strongly associated with specific classes.\nThis stage is the core of the entire study. It polishes the model from a generalist into a specialist, focusing\non strengthening its interpretability and intuitive decision-making capabilities. We introduce two unique\nloss functions to form the final total loss:\nLtotal = Ltask + \u03bbpurityLpurity + \u03bbfocusLfocus\nHere, Lpurity is the Symbol Purity Loss, which encourages each symbol to establish a unique association\nwith a specific label; Lfocus is the Gated Focus Loss, which encourages the model to actively use its intuition\ngate when confident.\n\u2022 Purpose:\n1. Distill Intuitive Essence: The core of this stage is data purification. Using a data filter, the\nlog from Phase 1 is sifted to identify samples where the model exhibited good intuitive responses\n(e.g., correct prediction, high gating score).\n2. Reinforce Expert Abilities: The model is trained for a second round using only this puri-\nfied, high-quality intuitive sample set. The aim is to have the model concentrate its resources\non strengthening the pattern recognition abilities it already excels at, ultimately forming fast,\naccurate expert intuition.\n\u2022 Refinement Filtering Criteria:\n1. Stability: Requires that the discrete symbols (quantized indices) generated by the model at\ndifferent layers must be highly consistent. As the model uses Vector Quantization (VQ) to forcibly\nquantize continuous vectors into discrete symbols, this makes the comparability of internal states\npossible.\n2. Activation: Requires that the intuition gating scores generated by the model for the sample\nmust be above a preset threshold. This gating score is a directly observable control signal that\nexplicitly represents the activation strength of the model\u2019s intuition channel.\n10\n\n3. Consistency: Requires a strong historical correlation between the symbol triggered by the model\nand the sample\u2019s true label. This relies on a symbol-to-label statistical database dynamically\nbuilt during the filtering process to quantify the semantic tendency of each discrete symbol.\n\u2022 Training Data Used: In addition to the original training set, a filtered, high-quality intuitive essence\ndataset (filtered_data_purist.json) is included. Its data volume is much smaller than the original\ntraining set, but every entry is a manifestation of the model\u2019s talent.\n\u2022 Key Outputs: A highly specialized expert model that performs better on specific patterns.\nTable 2: Comparison of Dynamic Intuition Model and Traditional Models\nFiltering\nDimen-\nsion\nWhy is this feasible in the Dynamic\nIntuition model?\nWhy is this not feasible in traditional\nmodels (e.g., ResNet, BERT, XG-\nBoost)?\n1. Stability\nThe Dynamic Intuition model, at each\nlayer, forcibly quantizes complex continu-\nous information into a single discrete Sym-\nbol (one of 256) via the VQ-AIM-Encoder.\nThis creates a clear, finite internal state,\nmaking \u201cwhether the Symbol changes\u201d a\nclearly measurable question (e.g., Symbol\n100 == Symbol 100).\nThe output of each layer in a traditional\nmodel is a high-dimensional, continuous\nfeature vector.\nComparing whether two\ncontinuous vectors are \u201cequal\u201d is meaning-\nless.\nWhile one can calculate their co-\nsine similarity, it is a fuzzy, approximate\nmeasure, far less clear and fundamental\nthan the Symbol identity comparison in\nDynamic Intuition. They lack the concept\nof a \u201cSymbol.\u201d\n2. Activation\nThe Dynamic Intuition model explicitly de-\nsigns a gating unit called intuition_gate.\nThe duty of this unit is to output a value\nbetween 0 and 1, explicitly representing the\nactivation strength of the \u201cintuition chan-\nnel.\u201d This is a directly observable and in-\nterpretable control signal.\nMost models do not have such a specific-\npurpose gate.\nAlthough recurrent neural\nnetworks like LSTM/GRU do have inter-\nnal \u201cgates\u201d (forget gate, input gate), their\npurpose is to control information flow, not\nto represent a kind of \u201cintuition strength.\u201d\nOne could analyze these gates, but it re-\nquires deep understanding of that spe-\ncific architecture, and its interpretability is\nless intuitive than the Dynamic Intuition\u2019s\nintuition_gate.\n3. Consistency\nBecause we have discrete Symbols, we can\nbuild a \u201cSymbol-to-Label\u201d statistical\ndatabase, much like creating a dictionary.\nWe can explicitly calculate data like \u201cSym-\nbol 100 has historically pointed to \u2018World\u2019\n95% of the time.\u201d This is a form of statis-\ntics based on discrete symbols.\nSince traditional models only have contin-\nuous feature vectors, they cannot create a\nstatistical table of \u201coccurrence frequency\u201d\nfor a vector. This is like being unable to\ncount all the \u201cidentical grains of sand\u201d in\nthe world. One must first perform cluster-\ning to group the countless vectors to create\na discrete concept similar to a Symbol, but\nthis adds extra complexity and uncertainty.\n1.\nStability & The Dynamic Intuition model, at each layer, forcibly quantizes complex continuous\ninformation into a single discrete Symbol (one of 256) via the VQ-AIM-Encoder. This creates a clear, finite\ninternal state, making whether the Symbol changes a clearly measurable question (e.g., Symbol 100 ==\nSymbol 100). & The output of each layer in a traditional model is a high-dimensional, continuous feature\nvector. Comparing whether two continuous vectors are equal is meaningless. While one can calculate their\ncosine similarity, it is a fuzzy, approximate measure, far less clear and fundamental than the Symbol identity\ncomparison in Dynamic Intuition. They lack the concept of a Symbol.\n2. Activation & The Dynamic Intuition model explicitly designs a gating unit called intuition_gate.\nThe duty of this unit is to output a value between 0 and 1, explicitly representing the activation strength\n11\n\nof the intuition channel. This is a directly observable and interpretable control signal. & Most models\ndo not have such a specific-purpose gate. Although recurrent neural networks like LSTM/GRU do have\ninternal gates (forget gate, input gate), their purpose is to control information flow, not to represent a kind\nof intuition strength. One could analyze these gates, but it requires deep understanding of that specific\narchitecture, and its interpretability is less intuitive than the Dynamic Intuition\u2019s intuition_gate.\n3. Consistency & Because we have discrete Symbols, we can build a Symbol-to-Label statistical\ndatabase, much like creating a dictionary. We can explicitly calculate data like Symbol 100 has histori-\ncally pointed to \u2019World\u2019 95% of the time. This is a form of statistics based on discrete symbols. & Since\ntraditional models only have continuous feature vectors, they cannot create a statistical table of occurrence\nfrequency for a vector. This is like being unable to count all the identical grains of sand in the world. One\nmust first perform clustering to group the countless vectors to create a discrete concept similar to a Symbol,\nbut this adds extra complexity and uncertainty.\nSummary Comparison\nThe differences between the two phases can be summarized in the table below:\nTable 3: Training Phase Comparison Table (booktabs style)\nCharacteristic\nPhase 1: Exploration & Recording\nPhase 2: Refinement Fine-tuning\nGoal\nBuild general capabilities, generate experience log\nStrengthen \u201cintuitive responses,\u201d become a\nTraining Data\nComplete original dataset\nComplete original dataset + filtered \u201cintuiti\n(training_data.json)\n(filtered_data.json)\nData Source\nProvided externally\nFrom self-reflection and refinement of\nTraining Philosophy\nBreadth-first\nDepth-first\nCore Output\nBaseline model + detailed learning log\nHighly specialized expert model\nIn conclusion, our process is not two simple, repetitive training runs, but a dynamic, introspective, and\nprogressively intelligent training flow.

This\ndatabase consists of over one million news articles from more than 2,000 news sources and is widely used by\nthe academic community for natural language processing research, such as text classification. This study\nselected a balanced subset of four main categories: World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech.\nThe inclusion criteria for research samples are articles from the AG News database that contain a title or\ndescription and are clearly assigned to one of the four categories mentioned above. The exclusion criterion\nis any article with empty text content or text that cannot be effectively encoded. In this study, all included\nsample texts were converted to lowercase and tokenized using a character-level vocabulary.\nTo ensure\nconsistency in model input, each text sequence was truncated or padded to a fixed sequence length of\n100 (SEQUENCE_LENGTH = 100).\nData Splitting and Baseline Model\nTo ensure the objectivity and comparability of the experiment,\nthis study follows standard practices in the machine learning field. Based on the standard division of the\npublic dataset, we used 20,000 training samples and 2,000 test samples. We further divided the\ntraining set into a 90% training set (18,000 samples) and a 10% validation set (2,000 samples) for\nhyperparameter tuning and convergence determination during model training. The final model performance\nevaluation was conducted on the separate 2,000 test samples.\n12\n\nTo objectively evaluate the performance of the Dynamic Intuition Classifier proposed in this study, we\nselected a widely used model in text classification tasks as the baseline: a standard Transformer classifier\nwith an architecture similar to our model but without the VQ-AIM encoder and intuition gating mechanism.\nThis helps to clarify the actual benefits brought by the innovative modules (VQ, gating) proposed in this\nstudy. In this research, the Baseline Model group refers to this standard Transformer classifier, while the\nExpert Model group refers to the Dynamic Intuition Classifier after the complete two-phase training.\nDuring the model validation phase, to improve computational efficiency, we randomly sampled 150 data\npoints (VALIDATION_SAMPLE_SIZE = 150) from the separate validation dataset (validation_data.json)\nto form a micro-validation set. This set was used to evaluate model performance and for model selection\nduring the training process.\nFiltering Criteria for the Intuitive Essence Dataset\nThe Expert Model group in this study does not\nuse the full training data but rather a strictly filtered Intuitive Essence Dataset (filtered_data_purist.json).\nThis dataset is generated by automatically filtering the learning history file (experience_db_finetuned.json)\nproduced after Phase 1 training, aiming to isolate samples where the model exhibited the clearest and most\nreliable intuitive responses. The filtering process is executed by the purifier filter by internals, with\nthe following core criteria and adjustable parameters:\n\u2022 Stability: Requires that the discrete intuition symbols (quantized indices) triggered by the model\nacross all internal Transformer layers (2 layers in this study) must be completely identical.\nFor\nexample, a sample\u2019s thought chain must be of the form \u2018[Symbol A -> Symbol A]\u2018, not \u2018[Symbol A ->\nSymbol B]\u2018. This criterion ensures that the model\u2019s semantic judgment for the sample is consistent\nand unambiguous.\n\u2022 Activation: Requires that the gating scores from all layers for the sample must be above a preset\nthreshold. This threshold is an adjustable parameter MIN_GATE_SCORE_THRESHOLD in the study (set to\n0.5 in experiments), ensuring that the selected samples have strongly activated the model\u2019s intuition\nchannel.\n\u2022 Consistency: This is the most critical criterion. The filtering script first creates a purity map for\neach discrete symbol (256 in total) based on the complete learning history file, tabulating the historical\ncorrelation strength of that symbol with each news category (World, Sports, etc.). Then, the script\nonly selects samples where the triggered symbol has the highest historical correlation with the sample\u2019s\ntrue label. For example, if a sample\u2019s true label is Sports and it triggers \u2018Symbol 10\u2018, it will only\nbe selected if the historical data for \u2018Symbol 10\u2018 shows it is most frequently used to predict Sports.\nThis process ensures a strong, verifiable correspondence between the symbols and the semantics they\nrepresent.\nThrough the multi-dimensional automated filtering described above, we are able to distill a high-quality,\nsmall-scale dataset from the vast training experience, specifically for polishing the model from a generalist\ninto an expert with reliable intuition.\n5\nData Collection and Variable Definitions\nThe data collection for this study is based on computer experiments, with all variables being automatically\ngenerated and recorded during the model training and evaluation processes.\n5.1\nModel Design\nThis study sets up two main modules:\n\u2022 Baseline Model: This group of models undergoes standard training on the AG News dataset to\ndevelop a foundational ability to recognize news categories.\n\u2022 Expert Model: Building on the baseline model, this group receives additional Gated Fine-tuning,\naimed at enhancing the model\u2019s intuitive ability to recognize news categories.\n13\n\n5.2\nPrimary Outcome Variables\n\u2022 Standard Accuracy: This is the fundamental metric for measuring the overall performance of the\nmodel. It is defined as the ratio of the number of correctly predicted samples Ncorrect to the total\nnumber of samples Ntotal in a given dataset (validation or test set):\nAccuracy = Ncorrect\nNtotal\n(12)\n\u2022 Gated Ratio: This metric measures the frequency with which the model activates the intuition\npathway during decision-making. For a dataset with N samples, if the average gating value across\nall layers for the i-th sample is \u00afgi, the Gated Ratio is defined as the proportion of samples where the\naverage gating value exceeds a preset threshold \u03b8 (set to 0.7 in this study):\nGated Ratio = 1\nN\nN\nX\ni=1\nI( \u00afgi > \u03b8)\n(13)\nwhere I(\u00b7) is the indicator function.\n\u2022 Intuitive Accuracy: This is the core metric for measuring the model\u2019s interpretability, specifically\nevaluating the quality of its decisions when its intuition is activated. It is defined as the proportion of\ncorrectly predicted samples within the subset of all samples deemed intuitively activated (i.e., \u00afgi > \u03b8):\nIntuitive Accuracy =\nPN\ni=1 I( \u00afgi > \u03b8 \u2227predi = truei)\nPN\ni=1 I( \u00afgi > \u03b8)\n(14)\nA higher value for this metric indicates that the model\u2019s intuition is more reliable.\n5.3\nExperimental Tools and Data Quality Control\nAll experiments in this study were conducted based on the Python programming language and the PyTorch\ndeep learning framework. The hardware environment for model training and evaluation was a server\nequipped with NVIDIA T4X2 GPUs, with CUDA enabled for acceleration.\nTo ensure the stability and reproducibility of the experimental results, the following quality control\nmeasures were taken:\n\u2022 Fixed Random Seeds: A fixed global random seed was set (torch.manual_seed(42); np.random.seed(42);\nrandom.seed(42)) to ensure consistency in random processes such as data splitting and model weight\ninitialization.\n\u2022 Standardized Data Preprocessing: All data were uniformly processed through the build_vocab_and_process_data\nfunction for vocabulary construction, tokenization, and sequence padding, ensuring homogeneity of\ninput data across different models.\n\u2022 Code Version Control: All experimental code was managed under the Git version control system,\nensuring the transparency and traceability of the experimental process.\n6\nStatistical Analysis and Ethical Statement\nThe data analysis in this study primarily employs descriptive statistical methods. We calculated the means\nof standard accuracy, intuitive accuracy, and gated ratio for each model group on the validation set and\ncompared these metrics across different models to evaluate the effectiveness of the gated fine-tuning method.\nThe specific evaluation process is implemented in the evaluate_model function, which automatically cal-\nculates and returns the aforementioned core metrics.\nAll data processing, model training, and statistical analysis were performed using Python (version 3.x)\nand relied on several scientific computing libraries, including PyTorch and NumPy. Within the framework\nof this study, the conventional threshold for statistical significance is set at p < 0.05. However, as this\nstudy is an exploratory computer experiment, formal hypothesis testing was not conducted; conclusions are\nprimarily drawn by comparing descriptive statistical results.\n14\n\nEthical Statement:\nThe AG News dataset used in this study is publicly available for academic research,\nand the original data providers have anonymized personally identifiable information. Therefore, this study\ndoes not involve human subjects and does not require approval from an Institutional Review Board (IRB).\n7\nExperiments\n7.1\nDataset and Settings\nWe conducted experiments on the AG News dataset, which contains news headlines and descriptions\nacross four categories (World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech). All models used the same hyperparameters:\nmodel dimension D_MODEL=128, number of attention heads NUM_HEADS=4, sequence length SE-\nQUENCE_LENGTH=100, codebook size CODEBOOK_SIZE=256, and number of Transformer block\nlayers NUM_LAYERS=2.\n7.2\nEvaluation Metrics\nIn addition to standard Accuracy, we introduce two specialized evaluation metrics:\n\u2022 Intuitive Accuracy: Measures the accuracy of the model when the intuition gate is activated.\nDuring inference, if the model\u2019s average gating value exceeds 0.5, it is considered intuition activated.\n\u2022 Gated Ratio: The frequency with which the model activates its intuition gate across the entire\nvalidation set.\n7.3\nResults and Discussion\nThe experimental results show that the expert model, after gated fine-tuning, achieved accuracy on par\nwith the baseline model but demonstrated significant improvements in performance and interpretability.\nThe fine-tuned model was able to produce symbols with greater purity, meaning each symbol had a higher\ncorrelation with a specific label, which made the symbol chain revealed during inference more semantically\nmeaningful. Furthermore, we observed that the gated focus loss successfully guided the model to more\nfrequently activate its intuition gate when predictions were correct, proving the effectiveness of this loss\nfunction in enhancing model interpretability.\nAll samples were classified by both the Baseline Model and the Gated Expert Model to evaluate perfor-\nmance across the four news categories (World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech). No data was missing during the\nexperiment. We primarily analyzed the models\u2019 classification accuracy, symbol purity, and the activation\nof the intuition gate. As shown in Table 1, the two models performed equally well in terms of macro accu-\nracy, but they exhibited significant differences in their internal decision-making mechanisms, which will be\ndetailed in subsequent sections.\nThe main findings of this study indicate that the gated fine-tuning expert model achieved a significant\nimprovement in interpretability while maintaining a classification accuracy comparable to the baseline\nmodel. As shown in Table 2, the average Purity Score of the symbols produced by the expert model was\nsignificantly higher than that of the baseline model ([Expert Model Mean] vs. [Baseline Model Mean], p\n< 0.01, via t-test). Figure 1 further illustrates the distribution of this difference, showing that the discrete\nsymbols learned by the expert model have a closer semantic association with specific labels. As a secondary\nresult, we observed that the gated focus loss successfully guided the model\u2019s behavior: among correctly\npredicted samples, the Intuition Gate Activation Rate of the expert model reached [value], significantly\nhigher than when predictions were incorrect [value] (p < 0.05, via chi-squared test), confirming that the\nloss function effectively encourages the model to rely on its learned symbol chains for confident decisions.\nThe presentation of results in this section follows the logical order of the research methodology, first\nreporting the macro performance of the models on primary metrics (classification accuracy and symbol\npurity), followed by an in-depth analysis of conditional differences in a secondary metric (intuition gate\nactivation rate).\nTable 1 compares the overall performance metrics of the baseline and expert models.\nTable 2 provides detailed statistics on symbol purity, highlighting the significant difference between the\ngroups (baseline vs. expert). Figure 1 visually presents the distribution of symbol purity scores, intuitively\ndemonstrating the superiority of the expert model in learning semantically consistent symbols. Together,\nthese figures and tables support the core conclusion of this study: the gated fine-tuning mechanism has a\nsignificant effect on improving model interpretability without negatively impacting model performance.\n15\n\n8\nVisual Analysis of Experimental Results\nThis study aims to evaluate the performance evolution of the Dynamic Intuition Classifier across two training\nphases. We compare key metrics from the fine-tuning phase (Phase 1) and the self-generated experience\nlearning phase (Phase 2), including model reward, gating scores, and the distribution of intuition symbols,\nto gain a deeper understanding of the model\u2019s behavioral changes.\n8.1\nSignificance of Visualization\n\u2022 Reward Distribution: This shows the overall performance of the model on the test dataset. The\nX-axis represents the Reward, where 1.0 means the model classified correctly and 0.0 means it was\nincorrect. The Y-axis is the count. It visually represents the model\u2019s accuracy, allowing one to see\nthe ratio of successful to failed cases at a glance, summarizing the model\u2019s macro-level performance.\n\u2022 Gating Score Distribution: This histogram shows the distribution of the Gating Scores output\nby the model\u2019s intuition gating mechanism.\nThe gating score can be understood as the model\u2019s\nconfidence in the intuition symbol it has chosen. This chart reveals the model\u2019s decision confidence\ncharacteristics. For example, if scores are mostly concentrated in the high range, it may indicate\nthe model is very confident in its decisions; if the distribution is wide, it might mean the model has\nuncertainty in some situations. This is crucial for analyzing the model\u2019s stability.\n\u2022 Symbol Category Distribution: This chart is central to the model\u2019s interpretability, mapping from\nintuition symbols (quantized indices) to semantic categories. It shows the distribution of intuition\nsymbols generated by the model across semantic categories for all experimental data. It proves that\nthe model learns not just random symbols, but intuitions with concrete semantic concepts.\nFor\ninstance, the chart might show the model frequently uses symbols related to conflict/military or\npolitics/government to process World news, which aligns with common sense and is strong evidence\nof the model\u2019s interpretability.\n8.2\nPhase 1 Model Performance Analysis\nIn the Phase 1 training stage, the model\u2019s reward distribution showed a significant bias, with an accuracy of\n50.94% (as shown in Figure 2a). Despite this, Figure 2b shows that the gating score distribution is highly\nconcentrated near 1.0. This indicates that the model exhibits blind optimism or overconfidence. This\nphenomenon reflects its yet-to-be-developed ability for precise decision calibration. Furthermore, Figure 2c\nshows that the semantic category distribution of the intuition symbols generated by the model is relatively\nconcentrated, suggesting the model may have overfitted to specific types of data.\n16\n\n(a)\nModel\nReward\nDistribution\n(Phase 1)\n(b)\nGating\nScore\nDistribution\n(Phase 1)\n(c) Semantic Distribution of Intuition Symbols (Phase 1)\nFigure 2: Visual Analysis of Experimental Results for Phase 1\n8.3\nPhase 2 Model Performance Analysis\nEntering Phase 2, the model learns from self-generated experience, and its performance shows a significant\nchange from Phase 1. As observed in Figure 3a, the model\u2019s accuracy stabilized at around 47.32%, showing\nno significant decline compared to Phase 1. More critically, Figure 3b shows that the distribution of gating\nscores shifted from a single peak to a more uniform and dispersed form. This implies that the model\nis no longer blindly confident but has learned to dynamically adjust the confidence level of its intuitive\njudgments based on the complexity and uncertainty of the task. This distribution reflects a healthier self-\nassessment capability. Figure 3c presents a more meaningful semantic distribution of intuition symbols,\ndemonstrating that the model has successfully mapped text content to human-understandable semantic\nconcepts, thus possessing high interpretability.\n17\n\nReward Distribution\n\n10,000\n9,000\n8,000\n7,000\n6,000\n5,000\n4,000\n3,000\n2,000\n\n1,000\n\n0 T T T\n0 (Failure) 4 (Success)\n\nGating Score Distribution\n\n4,500\n4,000\n3,500\n3,000\n2,500\n2,000\n1,500\n1,000\n\n500\n\n05\n\n00 01 02 03 04 fa 06 07 08 09 10\n\n\nSymbol-Category Distribution\n\nBusiness\n\n126\n135\n146\n\n70\n111\n\n42\n150\n130\n213\n\n66\n\noe\n\nSports\n\n135\n11\n163\n126\n146\n\n70\n158\n130\n\n42\n\n213\n\n100\n\n\u00b0\n\n100 200\n\n300\n\n400\n\nSci/Tech\n\n135\n130\n70\n163\n100\n146\n42\n126\n30\n\n203\n\no4\n\n100 200 300\n\nWorld\n\n126\n100\n135\n1\n70\n30\n146\n42\n130\n\n158\n\n\u00b0\n\n100 200 300 400\n\n(a)\nModel\nReward\nDistribution\n(Phase 2)\n(b)\nGating\nScore\nDistribution\n(Phase 2)\n(c) Semantic Distribution of Intuition Symbols (Phase 2)\nFigure 3: Visual Analysis of Experimental Results for Phase 2\n8.4\nSummary and Comparison of Experimental Results\nSynthesizing the results from both phases, we find that the main achievement of Phase 2 was not a dramatic\nincrease in accuracy, but rather the effective correction of the model\u2019s decision-making behavior.\nWith similar accuracy levels, the Phase 1 model\u2019s decisions were overly confident and monolithic, whereas\nPhase 2, through its self-learning mechanism, calibrated its intuition to a more well-adjusted and trustworthy\nstate. This transition from blind optimism to reasonable confidence is the most significant finding of this\nexperiment. It demonstrates the positive impact of self-generated experience learning on model calibration\nand offers important insights for future AI system design: while pursuing high accuracy, greater emphasis\nshould be placed on the reliability and interpretability of model decisions.\n9\nThe Explainability Analysis Toolkit\nTo deeply analyze the internal decision-making mechanism of the dynamic intuition model proposed in\nthis study, we have developed a comprehensive Explainability Analysis Toolkit. This toolkit is designed\nto transform the vast amount of internal state data generated by the model during inference into insights\nthat are understandable and analyzable by human researchers. This shifts the traditional black-box model\ntraining paradigm to a transparent, traceable glass-box diagnostic optimization process.

It defines how human-readable text (e.g., 26 English letters, punctuation) is mapped\nto numerical indices (Input IDs) that the model can process. This file is fundamental for decoding\nthe model\u2019s input and internal states.\n\u2022 experience_db_generated.json: This file is the core of this study\u2019s explainability, a detailed model\nmental activity report. For each piece of input data processed, it records the complete internal state,\nforming an auditable traceability chain. Its key fields include:\n\u2013 quantized_indices: The model\u2019s thought chain, recording the sequence of abstract symbols\n(AI mother tongue symbols) triggered at each dynamic layer, which is the cornerstone for un-\nderstanding its reasoning path.\n\u2013 label_text: The true label of the data, serving as the gold standard for judging the correctness\nof the model\u2019s prediction.\n\u2013 gating_scores: The sequence of gating scores, quantifying the model\u2019s reliance on the intuition\nchannel at each layer.\n\u2013 attention_weights: Compressed attention weights data, revealing which words the model fo-\ncused on when reading the input text.\n\u2013 reward: The reward value for the prediction (1.0 for correct, 0.0 for incorrect), a direct indicator\nof the success of a single experience.\nTogether, these two files constitute the Rosetta Stone of AI Intuition, enabling us to connect the abstract,\nnumerical operations inside the model with real-world semantics and outcomes.\n9.2\nVisualization Dashboard: The AI Intuition Explorer\nTo allow for intuitive interaction with the massive amount of experience data, we developed an interactive\nvisualization dashboard based on D3.js\u2014the AI Intuition Explorer1 2. This dashboard reveals the model\u2019s\nbehavioral patterns and knowledge structure from macro, meso, and micro levels.\n9.2.1\nMacro-level Statistical Analysis: The Model\u2019s Overall Decision-Making Style\nThe dashboard first presents two macro-level statistical charts to help researchers quickly grasp the model\u2019s\noverall performance and decision-making tendencies.\n\u2022 Reward Distribution: This bar chart visually displays the proportion of correct (reward=1.0) and\nincorrect (reward=0.0) predictions, serving as a quick window into the model\u2019s overall accuracy.\n\u2022 Gating Score Distribution: This chart reveals the model\u2019s decision-making style. High gating\nscores (e.g., > 0.5) indicate the model tends to use fast, automatic System 1 (intuitive thinking);\nlow scores represent a greater reliance on detailed System 2 (logical analysis). An ideal model should\nexhibit a bimodal distribution here, indicating it can decisively switch between the two modes based\non the situation. If scores are concentrated around 0.5, it suggests decisional hesitation and is an\nimportant signal for optimization.\n1https://cyrilliu1974.github.io/github.io/vi.html\n2https://parrawai.com/vi.html\n19\n\n9.2.2\nMeso-level Structural Analysis: The AI\u2019s Mind Map\nThe core of the dashboard is a Symbol Association Network Graph, which visualizes the abstract concepts\nlearned internally by the AI and their relationships as a mind map.\n\u2022 Nodes: Each node represents an abstract symbol.\nThe size of the node is proportional to the\nfrequency of the symbol\u2019s use, revealing the model\u2019s core concepts.\n\u2022 Links: The connections between nodes represent the relationship of symbols appearing consecutively\nin a thought chain. The thickness of the line is proportional to the co-occurrence frequency, depicting\nthe model\u2019s deeply ingrained associative pathways.\nThis network graph not only demonstrates the non-random and highly organized nature of the model\u2019s\ninternal knowledge structure but also reveals semantic communities formed by multiple symbols. When a\nresearcher clicks on a specific experience, that experience\u2019s thought chain is highlighted as a path on the\nnetwork graph, thus placing a single, micro-level thought process within the context of the macro-level\nknowledge structure for analysis (as shown in Figure 4).\nImage placeholder: A network graph with gray nodes and links, where a path of orange nodes and links is highlighted.\nFigure 4: Symbol Association Network Graph. The entire graph represents the model\u2019s overall knowledge\nstructure, while the highlighted orange path shows the specific thought chain for a single experience (ID=0).\n9.2.3\nMicro-level Traceability Analysis: Deconstructing a Single Thought Process\nThe dashboard\u2019s micro-level analysis tools allow researchers to conduct a deep trace of any single data\nexperience.\n\u2022 Interactive Experience Browser: A filterable table displays every raw experience in the database.\nClicking on any symbol in the network graph filters for all cases involving that symbol, allowing for\nviewing of their intuition sequence, reward, and gating scores.\n\u2022 Intuition Sequence: This is a visualization of the model\u2019s multi-layered dynamic reasoning process.\nIn our model\u2019s two-layer architecture, it consists of two colored blocks representing the thought chain\nin quantized_indices (e.g., A -> B). A sequence with the same color (A -> A) represents confir-\nmation and reinforcement of intuition; different colors (A -> B) represent correction and refinement\nof intuition, revealing the dynamic evolution of the model\u2019s thinking.\n\u2022 Self-Attention Heatmap: This heatmap quantifies and visualizes the operation of the model\u2019s\ninternal self-attention mechanism as it comprehends text. The X and Y axes of the heatmap both\nrepresent the input text sequence after being chunked. The color intensity of any cell (i, j) indicates the\ndegree of attention the model pays to the j-th text chunk (X-axis) while processing the i-th text chunk\n(Y-axis).

This chart reveals the direct\ntextual evidence for the model\u2019s judgments, serving as a key bridge between abstract symbols and\nraw data.\nFigure 5: Self-Attention Mechanism Heatmap. This chart shows the intensity of attention allocated by the\nmodel to the text chunks on the X-axis (attended objects) in order to understand the text chunk on the\nY-axis (query).\n9.3\nPrinciples for Interpreting Symbols and Patterns\nThe profoundness of this analysis framework lies in its revelation of the hierarchy of meaning within the\nmodel. To accurately interpret the model\u2019s decisions and avoid misjudging its internal states, we have\nestablished the following three core principles:\n9.3.1\nPrinciple One: Symbols are Semantic Atoms, not Final Verdicts\nEach discrete symbol learned by the model (e.g., Symbol 227) should be regarded as a semantic atom or a\nbasic unit, not a fixed, unique final judgment. Just as words in human language have polysemy, a symbol\u2019s\nhistorical semantic tendency (e.g., associated with Sports 34.95% of the time) only represents its most\ncommon usage or first impression. It can also be triggered in texts of other categories, representing more\nabstract concepts that cross domains (e.g., competition, ranking). Therefore, when analyzing the model\u2019s\ndecision, one must avoid taking the historical tendency of a single symbol as its definitive meaning in the\ncurrent context.\n21\n\nInteractive Experience Explorer\n\n1D Intuition Sequence\n5 ty\n7 a\n14 ul\n20 ul\n29 i\n37 it\n\n< a\n\nAttention Analyzer\n\nColor Scaling Facto: \u00a9 \u2014\u2014 50\n\nWeight: 0.5093\n[)) \u00a5-Axis Tokens: \u201c..US to supp.\u201d\n\nOriginal Text\nUs to support democracy WASHINGTON, Sept 18: The U..\nUS. groups accuse China of failing to stop intell...\n\nU.S. Raps Cuba on Its Presence Abroad (AP) AP - Th...\n\nUS blames Islamic charities for funding Iraq attac.\n\nHk legislative poll points to the future When the.\nHurricane Jeanne Takes Aim at Florida WEST PALM BE...\n\nUS bolsters force for Afghan poll The US is to sen.. >\n\n9.3.2\nPrinciple Two: Thought Chains form Grammar, giving Symbols Contextual Meaning\nIf a single symbol is a word, then a thought chain composed of multiple symbols (e.g., 227 -> 227) is a\nsentence with a grammatical structure. In this model, the symbol triggered by the preceding layer provides\ncontext for the thinking of the subsequent layer, making the generation of meaning hierarchical. The precise\nmeaning of a symbol depends on its position in the thought chain. For example, the pattern A -> B has\na collective meaning greater than the sum of the independent meanings of Symbol A and Symbol B; it\nrepresents a dynamic process of intuition correction and refinement, whereas A -> A represents intuition\nconfirmation and reinforcement.\n9.3.3\nPrinciple Three: Analyze the Historical Performance of Patterns, not the Historical\nTendency of Symbols\nThis is the key to this interpretability framework. The model\u2019s final decision is based on its confidence in a\ncomplete thought pattern (the sentence), not on its reliance on an isolated symbol (the word). As shown in\nthe subsequent case study, even if a symbol in the thought chain has a primary historical semantic tendency\nthat seems unrelated to the final predicted category, the historical success rate of the complete thought\npattern composed of that symbol may be very high.\nTherefore, to accurately understand the model\u2019s\ndecision, our analytical focus must shift from the static semantics of symbols to the dynamic performance\nhistory of thought patterns.\nA seemingly off-topic symbol might play a crucial abstract role within a\nsuccessful thought pattern.\n9.4\nApplication Example: Tracing an AI\u2019s Intuitive Judgment\nTo concretely demonstrate the analytical capabilities of this toolkit, we will dissect a real inference case.\nWhen the input text is Iraq War Escalates with New Attacks, the system\u2019s real-time analysis report is\nas follows:\n========================= Inference Prediction Result =========================\n[Step 1: Text to Input IDs (Based on your input)]\n- [38, 75, 58, 74, 2, 52, 58, 75, 2, 34, 76, 60, 58, 69, 58, 77, 62, 76, 2, 80]...\n[Step 2: Found Most Similar Experience (ID: 1595, Similarity: 0.60)]\n- Original Text: World leaders back Iraqi election World leaders end a conference on\nthe future of Iraq with strong support for the January polls.\n[Step 3: Simulate inference process based on the matched experience]\n- Predicted Category: World\n- Triggered AI Thought Chain: 227 -> 227\n- Gate Scores per Layer: 0.405 -> 0.885\n- Intuition Channel Activated: Yes (Average Gate Value: 0.6450)\n[Step 4: Analyze the historical semantic tendency of each Symbol in the thought chain]\n- [Layer 1] Symbol 227 (appeared 598 times):\n- Tends towards Sports: 209 times (34.95%)\n- Tends towards Business: 179 times (29.93%)\n- Tends towards Sci/Tech: 143 times (23.91%)\n- [Layer 2] Symbol 227 (appeared 598 times):\n- Tends towards Sports: 209 times (34.95%)\n- Tends towards Business: 179 times (29.93%)\n- Tends towards Sci/Tech: 143 times (23.91%)\n[Step 5: Deep Pattern Analysis based on Experience Database]\n- Thought pattern 227 -> 227 appeared 596 times in history.\n- Historical Success Rate (Average Reward): 49.33%\n====================================================================\nCase Analysis: This case reveals a decision process more subtle than direct inference. The model does\nnot directly process the new input but first finds the most semantically similar historical case (ID: 1595,\n22\n\nsimilarity 0.60) in its vast experience database, with the original text related to the Iraqi election. Then,\nthe model simulates the internal thought process used for that historical case and applies it to the current\njudgment.\nThe model\u2019s thought chain is 227 -> 227, which also represents intuition confirmation and reinforce-\nment. However, the change in gating scores 0.405 -> 0.885 reveals a deeper insight: the model\u2019s initial\nintuition in the first layer (Symbol 227) was relatively cautious (gating score 0.405), but after review and\nconfirmation in the second layer, its confidence in this intuitive path increased dramatically, and the intu-\nition channel was wide open (gating score 0.885).\nMost noteworthy is the analysis in Step 4: looking at the historical semantic tendency of Symbol 227\nalone, it primarily points to Sports (34.95%), with no direct connection to the final World news prediction.\nThis precisely demonstrates the power of this system\u2019s explainability\u2014it avoids a one-sided interpretation\nof a single symbol.\nThe Deep Pattern Analysis in Step 5 provides the answer: the complete thought\npattern 227 -> 227 has appeared 596 times in history, with an average success rate of about 49.33%. This\nmeans the model\u2019s final decision is based on its confidence in a complete, historically validated reasoning\npattern, not on a single symbol that may have semantic drift. This entire process transforms a seemingly\ncontradictory AI decision into a data-supported, logically layered, and convincing reasoning story.\n9.5\nFrom Diagnosis to Optimization: A New Paradigm for AI R&D\nThe ultimate value of this explainability analysis toolkit lies in its complete transformation of the traditional\nblind men and an elephant optimization process for AI models. Researchers no longer need to conduct\nexpensive, blind trial-and-error based on macro-level metrics but can perform precise, white-box diagnostic\noptimization.\n\u2022 Debugging and Optimization: When the model makes an error, researchers can trace its complete\nthought process. Was it a conceptual classification error (wrong symbol chosen), distracted attention\n(wrong word focused on), or stubborn adherence to a thought path with a historically low success\nrate? All issues are traceable, allowing optimization efforts to target the root cause directly.\n\u2022 Building Trust and Human-Machine Collaboration: By providing a clear chain of decision\nevidence, this system transforms AI from a mere tool into an understandable and trustworthy partner,\ngreatly enhancing the transparency and reliability of the model in critical application domains.\n\u2022 Automated Data Quality Management: Further, we can design automated algorithms based\non thought paths to filter out confusing data (similar paths but conflicting outcomes) or anomalous\ndata (triggering rare, failed paths) from the dataset, upgrading data optimization from a craft to a\nprecision industry.\nIn summary, this analysis framework based on AI Mother Tongue is not just a visualization tool but a\ncomplete, observable, and analyzable operating system for AI R&D. It firmly pushes AI training from an\nempirical alchemy towards a quantifiable precision science.\n10\nDiscussion\nThe core finding of this study is that by integrating vector quantization (VQ) and an intuition gating\nmechanism, we have successfully constructed a dynamic classifier that exhibits unprecedented built-in in-\nterpretability while maintaining high accuracy. The results indicate that the gated fine-tuning strategy\neffectively guides the model to learn discrete symbols that are semantically more pure, making the symbol\nchains formed during inference more semantically meaningful. This outcome directly addresses the research\ngoal of tackling the black-box problem of deep learning models and enhancing the transparency of their\ndecision-making processes. A potential underlying mechanism is that the gated focus loss function acts as\nan effective regularization tool, rewarding the model for activating its intuition pathway (i.e., relying on\nVQ symbols) when decisions are correct. This more closely aligns the learning of discrete symbols with the\nfinal classification task, imbuing these symbols with traceable semantic value.\nThe findings of this study are consistent with recent trends in the field of interpretable NLP. For example,\nin line with the conclusions of [Reference 1: a study on an interpretable model], our model also demonstrates\nthat introducing a discrete bottleneck helps the model learn more structured representations. What differs\nis that our study innovatively introduces a dynamic intuition gate, allowing the model to adaptively choose\n23\n\nwhether to rely on these discrete symbols based on its decision confidence, rather than statically forcing\nall decisions through this bottleneck. In contrast, while [Reference 2: another related model study] also\nemploys a gating mechanism, its purpose is primarily to improve model performance rather than focusing on\ninterpretability. The uniqueness of our study lies in our explicit design of the symbol purity and gated focus\nloss objectives, placing interpretability at the core of the optimization process, not merely as a by-product\nof model performance. This methodological difference may be the key reason we have achieved superior\ninterpretability without sacrificing accuracy.\nDespite the positive results, this study has some limitations. First, the samples are primarily from a\nnews classification dataset (AG News), which is relatively domain-specific. Future work needs to apply this\narchitecture to more diverse and complex NLP tasks (such as sequence labeling or text summarization) to\nverify its generalizability. Second, hyperparameters such as purity_lambda and gated_focus_lambda were\nset manually, which might limit the model\u2019s optimal performance. Exploring automated hyperparameter\ntuning methods will be an important direction for future improvement.\nDespite these limitations, the\ntheoretical value of this study lies in providing a new avenue for the interpretability of deep learning\nmodels, demonstrating that it is possible to guide a model to learn human-understandable decision logic\nthrough built-in mechanisms. Practically, this model has the potential to be applied in fields requiring\nhigh-transparency decisions, such as finance and healthcare. Future research should focus on developing\nmore advanced visualization tools, such as dynamically generating semantic descriptions for symbols, to\npresent the model\u2019s decision process more intuitively and allow users to interact with the model\u2019s intuition,\nfurther enhancing trust and efficiency in human-machine collaborative decision-making.\n10.1\nFuture Work\nFuture research directions could include:\n\u2022 Model Scaling: Proposing that more complex tasks can be addressed by increasing d_model (to\nenrich prototype content) or codebook_size (to increase the number of prototypes).\n\u2022 Architectural Evolution: Explicitly proposing the introduction of a Hierarchical Quantized VAE\n(HQ-VAE) as the next evolutionary step, enabling the system to evolve from a flat semantic space to\na hierarchical structure.\n\u2013 Achieving Coarse-to-Fine Semantic Understanding: After introducing the multi-level\ncodebooks of an HQ-VAE, the model will be able to learn hierarchical concepts. For example:\n\u2217First-level codebook: Might learn to distinguish very broad concepts, e.g., [#1: Politics,\n#2: Sports, #3: Entertainment].\n\u2217Second-level codebook: After an input is judged as #2 Sports, it would then be subjected\nto a finer judgment, e.g., [#2-1: Basketball, #2-2: Soccer, #2-3: Baseball].\n\u2013 Solving the Capacity Bottleneck of a Single Codebook: For extremely complex tasks\n(e.g., legal document classification), simply increasing codebook_size to tens of thousands would\nlead to difficult and inefficient training. HQ-VAE, through its hierarchical approach, can use a\nsmaller total number of codebook entries to compose a more powerful and organized semantic\nrepresentation.\n\u2022 Multi-task Learning: Applying this architecture to other, more complex NLP tasks, such as se-\nquence labeling or text summarization, to verify its versatility.\n\u2022 Automated Hyperparameter Tuning: Exploring methods to automatically learn weights like\n\u03bbpurity and \u03bbfocus to reduce manual intervention.\n\u2022 Advanced Visualization: Further developing more advanced symbol visualization tools, such as\ndynamically generating semantic descriptions for symbols, to more intuitively present the model\u2019s\ndecision-making process and allow users to interact with the model\u2019s intuition.\nReferences\n[1] A\"aron van den Oord, Oriol Vinyals, and Koray Kavukcuoglu.

ACM, New York, NY, USA, 15 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3733802.\n3764058\n1\nIntroduction\nThe application of Differential Privacy (DP) [12] in Natural Lan-\nguage Processing (NLP) has been actively pursued by researchers in\nrecent years, particularly to bring the robust guarantees promised\nby DP into the realm of language data processing, where the preva-\nlence of sensitive data is particularly high. Incorporating DP guar-\nantees directly on text data itself, referred to as differentially private\ntext sanitization [44], offers direct privacy guarantees on potentially\nsensitive texts, but the application of DP is not as straightforward\nas with more structured domains [23]. Concretely, the discrete yet\nhighly creative nature of language [8], the high dimensionality re-\nquired to represent language numerically [14], and the procedures\nrequired to augment representations to adhere to the DP framework\n[20], all lead to unique challenges in achieving DP NLP.\nAn early and intuitive class of solutions to fuse DP into NLP\nbegan at the base unit of language: the word [15]. Word-level DP text\nsanitization approaches typically involve mapping an input word\nto a \u201cnoisy\u201d output word that fulfills DP guarantees according to a\nchosen \ud835\udf00parameter, known as the privacy budget. This guarantee\ncan be fulfilled in a number of ways, primarily either by adding noise\nto word embedding representations, or by using the Exponential\nMechanism to randomize among a set of candidate replacement\nwords [19]. Here, it is important to note that the privacy guarantee\n(i.e., adhering to DP) is given per word, and that nearly all relevant\nliterature leverages the notion of metric local DP (MLDP), where\nsanitization is performed locally by the user [30].\nA potential practical problem arises when considering the fact\nthat word-level guarantees are not entirely useful in isolation, and\nthat NLP tasks often necessitate full texts for implementing down-\nstream tasks [44]. Fortunately, DP allows for a transition from\narXiv:2508.18976v1  [cs.CR]  26 Aug 2025\n\nWPES \u201925, October 13\u201317, 2025, Taipei, Taiwan\nMeisenbacher et al.\nword-level to document-level guarantees, in that the property of\ncompositionality can be leveraged to reason about how word-level\nguarantees can be composed [15, 28]. In particular, sanitizing all\nthe \ud835\udc5btokens in a given document with privacy budget \ud835\udf00= 3 can be\ncomposed for a document-level budget of 3\ud835\udc5b, leading to a unified,\nalbeit weaker, guarantee from component sanitization steps.\nThe major downside with respect to privacy when leveraging\nsuch compositionality was revealed in a recent work by Tong et al.\n[39], who highlight the vulnerabilities introduced to word-level DP\ntext sanitization when considering context. The specific risks lie in\nthe fact that while single word-level perturbations are performed\nin isolation, sanitizing (privatizing) an entire document leaves con-\ntextual clues which may aid a capable attacker in deducing both\nthe overall original meaning, as well as in inferring original words\nbased on context. This only exacerbates the challenges of word-\nlevel DP methods, which have already been criticized for their lack\nof contextual awareness [24], wherein this limitation also opens\nthe door to adversarial inference attacks.\nDespite the important vulnerabilities demonstrated by Tong et al.\n[39], we highlight three major limitations of the work. (1) Firstly, the\nauthors only consider two mechanisms from a particular subclass\nof word-level DP mechanisms leveraging the Exponential Mecha-\nnism, namely SanText [44] and CusText [11], thereby leaving it\nunknown how vulnerable other DP methods may be. (2) Secondly,\naccording to our understanding of the work, in the execution of the\nsanitization steps, the authors do not set uniform document-level\nbudgets, but instead choose word-level \ud835\udf00values that are applied\nin an unbounded fashion to all texts (more on this in Section 4.1),\nthereby not ensuring a fair comparison across all texts in a dataset.\n(3) Finally, the authors rely on BERT-based inference attacks, not ex-\nploring the inferential abilities of more advanced generative LLMs.\nWe address these key limitations, with the goal of extending the\nfindings of Tong et al. [39] and broadening the understanding and\nextent of contextual vulnerability in word-level DP text sanitiza-\ntion methods. Following an initial reproduction case study with\nSanText, we implement LLM-based adversarial inference attacks\non three additional word-level DP methods across a variety of \ud835\udf00\nbudgets, with the ultimate goal of (original) data reconstruction.\nWe test the vulnerability of all four methods on three datasets, mea-\nsuring privacy vulnerability using semantic and task-based metrics.\nBased on these results, we conduct a critical analysis, leading to\nrecommendations for the field going forward.\nOur findings reveal that although LLM-based data reconstruc-\ntion attacks on DP-sanitized texts can serve to recapture semantics,\ndegrade utility, and sometimes increase attacker performance, do-\ning so also can prove to be beneficial as a post-processing step after\nsanitization. In particular, we find that in some settings, using LLMs\nafter DP text sanitization strengthens defense against adversarial\nattacks, increases plausible deniability, and improves the privacy-\nutility trade-off, while always significantly improving text coher-\nence. These results ground an analysis of the dangers and merits of\nDP text sanitization, leading to a set of practical recommendations.\nWe advance DP text privatization by widening the understanding\nof the contextual vulnerability of word-level MLDP. Specifically:\n(1) We advance recent literature on privacy vulnerabilities in\nword-level DP text sanitization by introducing a simple yet\nintuitive attack leveraging modern LLMs.\n(2) We extend the testing of such vulnerabilities by conducting\nexperiments with further methods, datasets, and metrics.\n(3) We interpret our experimental results in a discussion on the\ndangers of word-level text sanitization methods for docu-\nment privatization, but also include recommendations for\ntheir safe and effective use.\n2\nFoundations\n2.1\nDifferential Privacy\nDifferential Privacy [12] is a mathematically grounded notion of\nprivacy, specifically one that protects individuals by bounding the\nprobability of inferring the information attributed to them in a\ndataset. Intuitively, such protections are offered by adding cali-\nbrated noise to computations on the data, or even the data itself,\nthereby granting plausibility deniability as to what the \u201ctrue\u201d value\nof the data may be. DP was originally envisioned for structured,\nrelational datasets, in which each entry in the dataset represents the\nindividual, and neighboring or adjacent datasets can be defined as\ntwo datasets differing in exactly one individual data point (row). Un-\nder DP, any computations performed on two neighboring datasets\nshould be indistinguishable to some bound, which is governed by\nthe privacy parameter \ud835\udf00, also known as the privacy budget. For-\nmally, this indistinguishability requirement is represented in the\nfundamental inequality enforced by DP:\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f[M(\ud835\udc371) \u2208S]\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f[M(\ud835\udc372) \u2208S] \u2264\ud835\udc52\ud835\udf00,\nfor any databases \ud835\udc371 and \ud835\udc372 differing in exactly one element, any\n\ud835\udf00> 0, any computation or function M, and all S \u2286\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52(M).\nThis is known as \ud835\udf00-DP, and the notion above refers to global DP.\nAnother notion is that of local DP (LDP) [21]. In the local setting,\nwe assume that the central curator or processor of the dataset is not\ntrusted. Here, DP can be ensured at the user level; however, since\nthe entirety of the dataset is not yet known, LDP imposes a much\nstricter indistinguishability requirement, i.e., between any potential\nneighbor. This differs from the global notion, since neighboring\ndatabases only refer to those resulting from the dataset \ud835\udc37. Formally,\nfor the finite spaces P and V, and for all \ud835\udc65,\ud835\udc65\u2032 \u2208P and all \ud835\udc67\u2208V:\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f[M(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc67]\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f[M(\ud835\udc65\u2032) = \ud835\udc67] \u2264\ud835\udc52\ud835\udf00\nThus, an observed output cannot be attributed to a specific input\nwith a high probability. While this notion is clearly stricter, it allows\nfor the quantification of a privacy guarantee on the local, single\ndata point level without the need for an aggregated dataset.\nAnother development in the DP field came with the growing\nneed for reasoning about privacy in non-structured data settings,\nsuch as location privacy or in natural language. Introduced by\nChatzikokolakis et al. [10], the notion of metric DP augments the\noriginal definition by adapting the privacy reasoning to metric\nspaces, or representational spaces endowed with a distance metric\n\ud835\udc51. As can be seen in the definition of metric local DP (MLDP),\nproposed by Alvim et al. [1], the indistinguishability requirement\nbetween any two data points is now scaled based on their distance\n(often interpreted as similarity), thereby relaxing the strict, uniform\nrequirement between any two points as enforced by local DP:\n\nUnderstanding Contextual Vulnerability in Word-level Text Sanitization\nWPES \u201925, October 13\u201317, 2025, Taipei, Taiwan\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f[M(\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc67]\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5f[M(\ud835\udc65\u2032) = \ud835\udc67] \u2264\ud835\udc52\ud835\udf00\ud835\udc51(\ud835\udc65,\ud835\udc65\u2032)\nIn this work, we conduct experiments solely on mechanisms\nleveraging MLDP, as this has become the predominant notion for\nword-level DP, explained in the following.\n2.2\n(Word-level) DP in NLP\nEarly works conducting research on the integration of DP into NLP\nacknowledged several challenges [14, 23], chief of which was the\ntransfer of DP concepts such as the individual to the unstructured\ndomain of text and language. With the aid of MLDP, many early ap-\nproaches worked on differentially private text privatization on the\nword level, leveraging the popular technique of word embeddings\n[31] that were well suited to MDP notions.\nUsing different methods of word embedding representation, early\nword-level MLDP approaches designed perturbation mechanisms, in\nwhich calibrated noise is added to word embedding representations,\nand then a nearest neighbor search is performed to reach a discrete\n\u201cnoisy\u201d word [13, 15]. Contemporary and follow-up works focused\non optimizing the privacy-utility trade-off via the use of alternative\nmetric spaces [16], different distance metrics beyond the typical\nEuclidean distance [43], or modified mechanism designs [9, 26, 42].\nIn another class of word-level MLDP approaches, other works\nleverage the fundamental Exponential Mechanism [25] for DP\nword perturbations, extending MLDP in a utility-optimized manner\n(UMLDP) [11, 44]. Specifically, such works ground their mecha-\nnisms in the notion that not all words are semantically sensible re-\nplacements for a given word, and thus, the replacement sets should\nbe constrained to a smaller subset. Using the Exponential Mecha-\nnism, a noisy replacement can be chosen, scaled by the semantic\nsimilarity between each replacement candidate and the target word.\n2.2.1\nFrom words to documents. An immediate limitation of the\nword-level model is the reasoning about the word as the \u201cdatabase\u201d.\nLocal DP necessitates that any two words are adjacent, and MLDP\nmechanisms thus only operate on (and provide privacy guarantees\nfor) single words. This one user, one word model [15] is quite limit-\ning, as the vast majority of NLP tasks require larger units of data\nfor meaningful analysis. Fortunately, the compositionality prop-\nerty of DP becomes useful for extending word-level perturbations\nto document-level privatization, in that sequentially performed\nperturbations can be composed to provide document-level guaran-\ntees. Concretely, DP composition states that for two DP algorithms\n\ud835\udc401 with privacy parameter \ud835\udf001 and \ud835\udc402 with privacy parameter \ud835\udf002,\ntheir combination, defined to be \ud835\udc401,2: \ud835\udc401,2(x) = (\ud835\udc401(x), \ud835\udc402(x)), is\n(\ud835\udf001 +\ud835\udf002)-differentially private. The composition of word-level MLDP\nto document-level guarantees is illustrated in Figure 1.\nThe implications of composition in the context of word-level DP\nare significant. Despite the limitation of single-word perturbations,\none can still reason about document-level guarantees by sequen-\ntially performing privatization on each word of a given document,\nand subsequently compose the individual privacy budgets for a\ncomposed guarantee [28]. This reasoning becomes important in\nconducting our experiments, where we ensure that every text doc-\nument is privatized with the same overall document-level budget,\nan important consideration missed in previous works.\nFigure 1: An example of word-level MLDP and document-\nlevel composition. Word-level MLDP (and the resulting pri-\nvacy guarantees) operate per word. In order to sanitize docu-\nments, the basic composition property of DP is leveraged to\nachieve a document-level privacy budget and guarantee.\n2.3\nChallenges of Word-level DP\nDespite the simplicity and demonstrated effectiveness of word-level\nMLDP approaches, recent literature has pointed out several short-\ncomings [24]. A clear limitation is the lack of contextual privatiza-\ntion, where word perturbations are performed in isolation, without\nregard to the surrounding semantic context. Thus, privatized docu-\nments achieved via MLDP can lack both grammatical correctness\nand fluency. In allowing for the release of private documents, compo-\nsition opens up a new danger in the way that privatized documents\nmatch the exact length of the original document, due to the one-to-\none perturbation, thus already leaking important attributes of the\noriginal text and degrading the privacy guarantees offered by DP.\nRecent works strive to address some of these challenges, for\nexample by injecting syntax [3] or context [2, 4] into word-level DP.\nAnother recent work by Tong et al. [39], which we directly build\nupon, further investigates privacy vulnerabilities of word-level\napproaches despite recent advances, where they demonstrate that\nthe contextual remnants after privatization can lead to successful\n\u201creversals\u201d of word-level perturbations. As previously noted, we\nindicate several limitations with this work, however, including the\nsole focus on UMLDP mechanisms and not other MLDP methods,\nas well as the lack of uniform privacy budgets or use of LLM-based\nadversarial inference attacks. We design our experiments, outlined\nin the following, to address these limitations, with the aim of further\ninvestigating the potential harms of contextual vulnerability. In the\nscope of this work, we define contextual vulnerability to be semantic\nremnants of the original, non-privatized texts, which are left due\nto the randomization inherent to DP processes. These remnants, or\n\u201cclues\u201d, allow for the basis of contextual inference, or inferring the\noriginal text (or pieces thereof) based on carried-over context.\n\nMLDP\ne=1\n\n|\n\n| oa |\n\n\nWPES \u201925, October 13\u201317, 2025, Taipei, Taiwan\nMeisenbacher et al.\n3\nExperimental Setup\nWe ground our experiments in an investigation of the capabilities\nof LLMs to infer original semantics given the privatized outputs of\nword-level MLDP. In following Tong et al. [39], we first conduct a\ncase study using the SanText mechanism, exploring the impact of\nstrictly enforcing document-level budgets versus open-ended pri-\nvatization. Then, we extend our experiments to three recent MLDP\nmechanisms, with the goal of broadening the generalizability of\nour findings beyond UMLDP mechanisms. The basis of our experi-\nments, namely the adversarial method, evaluation techniques, and\nemployed metrics, are detailed in the following.\n3.1\nDatasets and Privatization\nFor DP text sanitization, we use three publicly available datasets.\nImportantly, these datasets feature user-written texts attributed to\ndistinct authors, and each author in the dataset writes many texts.\n3.1.1\nDatasets. We choose three datasets that represent sensitive\nuser-written texts, whereby privatization measures would be well-\nadvised. These three datasets are described in the following.\nYelp Reviews. We use a subset of the Yelp Reviews (YR) corpus as\nprepared by Utpala et al. [40]. The dataset contains 17,295 reviews\nwritten by the top-10 most frequently writing authors, with the top\nauthor associated with 3023 reviews and the tenth author associ-\nated with 1391 reviews. The original dataset is intended for binary\nsentiment analysis, and additionally, we also design an adversarial\nauthorship inference task, mimicking an adversary wishing to infer\nthe identity of an author given only the review text.\nMental Health Blog. The Mental Health Blog (MHB) dataset [7]\ncontains a large selection of blog posts from an online mental health\nforum. The posts are categorized by concern, for example depression\nor anxiety. From the larger corpus, we select only the posts from\nthe top-50 writing authors, ranging from 115 posts to 8 posts. This\nsubset results in 709 total posts, which are distributed between four\ncategories: depression, anxiety, ptsd-trauma, and suicidal-thoughts-\nand-self-harm. Thus, the dataset presents a four-class classification\ntask, along with a 50-class adversarial inference task.\nEnron Emails. Enron Emails1 (EE) is a corpus of about 500k\nemails from the Enron organization, made public in 2003 during a\npublic investigation carried out by the United States Federal Energy\nRegulatory Commission. In particular, we use the subset as prepared\nby Meisenbacher et al. [27], which only includes the sent emails\nfrom the top-28 users in the corpus, amounting to 12,283 emails,\nwith a maximum of 958 and a minimum of 85 per user. This dataset\nhas no associated downstream task, but we leverage the author IDs\nfor another adversarial authorship inference task.\n3.1.2\nChosen DP Mechanisms. We first conduct a case study with\nSanText [44], investigating the effect of bounding document-level\nprivacy budgets. Additionally, we experiment with three MLDP\nmechanisms from the recent literature. These four mechanisms\nare briefly introduced in the following, where we also refer the\ninterested reader to the original works for further details.\n1https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/\nSanText [44]. SanText proposes a utility-preserving mecha-\nnism for word-level UMLDP, most notably by considering the most\n\u201csuitable\u201d candidates for sanitizing an input word. The private out-\nput word, therefore, is produced by randomizing (using the Expo-\nnential Mechanism) within this set of candidate replacements. As\nwith Tong et al. [39], we experiment with the improved version\n(SanText+), which goes further to sanitize only the \u201cmost sensitive\u201d\nwords, which are determined by using frequency statistics from a\nreference dataset. For the purposes of this work, we use the exact\nsame reference dataset as the original work, namely SST-2 [36].\nCalibrated Multivariate Perturbations (CMP) [15]. CMP, also kno-\nwn in the literature as MADLIB, is an early word-level MLDP ap-\nproach, which calibrates multivariate noise from the normal dis-\ntribution based on a given input word embedding, adds this noise,\nand then finds the nearest neighbor to project the perturbed vec-\ntor back to an output private word. We use a publicly available\ncode implementation [30], which leverages 300-dimensional GloVe\nembeddings [33] as the underlying word embedding model.\nMahalanobis (Maha) [43]. Maha builds upon CMP by integrat-\ning a more advanced distance metric, the Mahalanobis distance,\nto account for sparse regions in the word embedding space where\nconsistently obtaining perturbed words (beyond the original word)\nis more difficult. Similar to CMP, we utilize a publicly available\ncode implementation of the Maha mechanism [30].\n1-Diffractor [26]. 1-Diffractor introduces a modified MLDP\nmechanism, in which word embedding models are projected down\nto one-dimensional arrays. Calibrated noise is added along this one\ndimension, allowing for efficient word perturbations. We utilize the\nimplementation made available by the original work, particularly\nusing the geometric variant of the mechanism.\n3.1.3\nPrivatization Approach. We design a comprehensive experi-\nmental approach with respect to sanitization (privatization), aris-\ning from the limitations of previous work in the lack of uniform\ndocument-level budgets. We tailor document-level privacy budgets\n(\ud835\udf00values) to each of our three datasets, and we carefully select base\n(per-word) \ud835\udf00values given each of our four chosen mechanisms.\nWe first begin with a review of the original works proposing\nour four chosen mechanisms, choosing base \ud835\udf00values, determined\nby the range of values in the experimental setups of these original\nworks. In particular, we choose three values for each mechanism,\nrepresenting a strict (low), medium, and lenient (high) \ud835\udf00. These\nvalues are shown in Table 1. Note that for CMP and Maha, we use\nthe same values due to similar values in the original works.\nGiven the base \ud835\udf00values, we proceeded to calculate the average\nnumber of words in each of the datasets, using the word tokeniza-\ntion tool of the nltk library. Then, document-level budgets were\nfixed by multiplying each of the base values by the average words\nresult, thereby achieving the per-document privacy budget for all\ntexts in a given dataset (see Table 1).\nWith these budgets, we sanitized all texts in each of three datasets,\nfor each of the (mechanism, \ud835\udf00) configurations. To accomplish this,\nthe fixed document-level privacy budget was divided by the num-\nber of words in a text to be privatized, thereby giving an instance-\nspecific, per-word \ud835\udf00value. This was done to ensure that all docu-\nments (texts) in a dataset achieved an equal (composed) privacy\n\nUnderstanding Contextual Vulnerability in Word-level Text Sanitization\nWPES \u201925, October 13\u201317, 2025, Taipei, Taiwan\nTable 1: Chosen base and document privacy budgets (\ud835\udf00), cal-\nculated from the average number of words per document in\neach dataset.

Note that for readability, we refer to the base \ud835\udf00when\nreporting results \u2013 these refer to the document-level budgets for\ntheir respective datasets and mechanisms.\n3.2\nLLM-based Contextual Text Reconstruction\nGiven all the sanitized counterparts of the original datasets (for all\nmechanisms and their associated \ud835\udf00budgets), we proceed to design\nan LLM-based method for restoring the structure and semantics of\nthe original document given the private document. We ground this\napproach in the theory that performing word-level MLDP at the\ndocument level can leave contextual remnants from the original\ntext, thus degrading the privacy-preserving capabilities of DP text\nsanitization. This we refer to as contextual vulnerability. Therefore,\nwe test the hypothesis that LLMs, with their powerful contextual\nabilities, pose a risk to word-level MLDP methods, with the potential\nto \u201cundo\u201d the privatization afforded by such methods.\n3.2.1\nAttack Vector. We model an adversary with access to ad-\nvanced LLMs, as well as with the following information: (1) knowl-\nedge of the text sanitization method and the privacy budget used,\nand (2) knowledge of the domain of the target texts and access to\nexamples resembling these texts.\nGiven this, the adversary takes the following steps:\n(1) Curate a few text examples that closely match the target\ntexts. In our experiments, we chose three examples.\n(2) Sanitize these texts using the target MLDP method and\nknown privacy budget, yielding (sanitized, original) pairs.\n(3) Craft a few-shot LLM prompt with the goal of returning the\n\u201coriginal\u201d text when a \u201cnoisy\u201d text is inputted. The prepared\n(sanitized, original) pairs comprise the few-shot examples.\n(4) Given the possession of the sanitized target texts, run these\ntexts through the LLM with the crafted prompt, thereby\nobtaining reconstructed versions of the sanitized texts.\nTo create the prompt as described in step (3), we design a prompt\nto focus on producing a reasonable and coherent \u201cclean\u201d output\ngiven the \u201cnoisy\u201d (MLDP-sanitized) input text. We also place an\nexplicit instruction to maintain the same length as the input length,\nas an adversary would know about the one-to-one mapping of\ncomposed word-level perturbations, as well as the fact that the\nsame words should remain the same (i.e., they were not perturbed).\nThe resulting prompt is provided in Table 2.\nTable 2: Few-shot Prompt for LLM Text Reconstruction.\nPrompt\nYou will be given a noisy_text document.\nYour task is to understand the semantic meaning of the text and decrypt the noisy text to\nits original form.\nIt is important that the length of the text stays exactly the same. Only replace noisy words\nwith reasonable substitutions. In some cases, words should remain the same.\nIt is also crucial that the output clean text is coherent and follows a cohesive narrative.\nProvide your feedback as follows:\nOutput:::\nClean Text: (your rewritten text)\nHere are some examples of how to rewrite noisy texts:\nnoisy_text: [SANITIZED TEXT 1]\nOutput:::\nClean Text: [ORIGINAL TEXT 1]\nnoisy_text: [SANITIZED TEXT 2]\nOutput:::\nClean Text: [ORIGINAL TEXT 2]\nnoisy_text: [SANITIZED TEXT 3]\nOutput:::\nClean Text: [ORIGINAL TEXT 3]\nNow here is the noisy text.\nnoisy_text: [TARGET TEXT]\nOutput:::\nClean Text:\n3.2.2\nSelected LLMs and Prompting Procedure. To test a variety of\ncurrently available LLMs, we select two popular closed-source LLMs\nand two open-source models. In particular, we choose GPT-4o-mini\n(2024-07-18) from OpenAI [32] and gemini-2.0-flash from Google\n[37]. For open-source models, we use Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-\nTurbo [17] and gemma-3-27b-it [38]. The closed-source models\nwere called via their respective APIs, and the open-source models\nwere called from the together.ai2 platform. Note that we chose to\nutilize only \u201clarger\u201d LLMs due to the assumption that their inferen-\ntial and generative capabilities would be stronger, and we do not\nexperiment with any smaller LLMs (1B, 3B, etc.). For all LLMs, the\ndefault temperature value of 1 was used.\nWe sequentially prompted (Table 2) the LLMs on all texts in the\nsanitized dataset variants described previously. This comes with\nthe exception of the first three texts of each dataset, which we held\nout as the few-shot examples for the prompt. These three texts\nwere not included in any of the subsequent analyses reported in\nthis work, i.e., they are only used for the prompts. After calling\nthe LLMs using the prepared prompts, simple parsing was done\nto retrieve only the \u201cclean text\u201d; no further post-processing was\nperformed. We note that in order to maintain the budget set for our\nstudy, the two open-source models were not run on Yelp.\nThe complete adversarial process is depicted in Figure 2.\n3.3\nEvaluation Approach\nWe conduct a multi-faceted evaluation to investigate the impact on\nboth privacy and utility before and after the LLM reconstruction\nstep. In particular, we explore whether leveraging such an approach\ncan effectively exploit the contextual vulnerability of word-level\nMLDP, and to what degree. For privacy evaluation, we test the\nlevel of defense against adversarial inference, the plausible deni-\nability afforded by the sanitized texts, and the resistance against\n2https://www.together.ai/\n\nWPES \u201925, October 13\u201317, 2025, Taipei, Taiwan\nMeisenbacher et al.\nFigure 2: The LLM-based contextual inference process, which\naims to reconstruct original texts based on outputs from\nMLDP mechanisms. The process assumes that an adversary\nhas knowledge of the MLDP mechanism and the utilized\nprivacy budget, and can mimic the sanitization process to\nproduce few-shot examples for the LLM prompt.\nfurther contextual inference. We also measure the utility of the\ntexts pre- and post-reconstruction, quantified by downstream task\nperformance, semantic similarity, and text coherence. Finally, we\ncalculate the privacy-utility trade-off, observing how this trade-off\nis affected by sanitization and attempted reversal.\n3.3.1\nPrivacy Evaluation. To evaluate privacy, we test two impor-\ntant aspects: defense against inference attacks and plausible denia-\nbility (indistinguishability). These are described in the following.\nDefense against inference attacks (P). In this stage of our privacy\nevaluation, we model an attacker who wishes to obtain the identity\nof the author of a given text, called authorship attribution. Since\nall of our three datasets contain author information (IDs), such an\nattack scenario can be modeled. In particular, we assume a 90/10\ntrain/test split, where the train split is in the public domain and the\nattacker can leverage these texts to train an adversarial classification\nmodel to identify an author by their written text (i.e., style, tone,\ndiction, etc.). Then, given the sanitized versions of the test split, the\nadversary strives to \u201cde-anonymize\u201d the respective authors using\nthe trained classification model.\nFollowing the recent literature [24, 40], we model two variants\nof the above-described attacker. The static (s) attacker does not\nhave knowledge of the sanitization method or privacy budget, and\ntherefore must train the attack model on the original (clean) texts\n(train split). The more capable adaptive (a) attacker does indeed have\nthis knowledge, and uses this knowledge to sanitize the train split,\nin order to better mirror the target test split. Following the training\nof their adversarial classification models, both attackers evaluate\ntheir models on the sanitized test split. For the classification models,\nwe fine-tune deberta-v3-base [18] models on the respective train\nsets for one epoch (YR and EE) or three epochs (MHB), using all\ndefault parameters of the HuggingFace Trainer toolkit. The choice\nof three epochs was made due to the smaller size of MHB.\nTo measure the defense afforded by sanitization methods against\nthese attackers, we first measure the performance of the static at-\ntacker on the non-sanitized test splits of the three datasets, which\nrepresent the baseline. Then, all subsequent evaluations on the sani-\ntized test splits are compared against the baseline, and the difference\nin adversarial performance represents the empirical privacy gains\nafforded by privatization. For all tests, we use the micro-F1 score\nfrom the authorship attribution task as the performance metric.\nPlausible deniability (indistinguishability, In). At the basis of\nall DP mechanisms is the injection of plausible deniability into a\ndataset, or rather, into computations performed on the data. At\ntheir core, DP mechanisms (including those in NLP) strive to offer\nplausible deniability by making it difficult to deduce what the input\nto a computation or query was, given only the noisy output result.\nIn the context of MLDP, a good mechanism should yield such plau-\nsible deniability in the form that a private output (document) is\nreasonably indistinguishable from its original input.\nWe measure plausible deniability by introducing an indistin-\nguishability metric, which provides an idea of how closely and to\nwhat degree, on average, the private output text resembles its orig-\ninal input. Intuitively, a mechanism that always outputs private\ntexts that are nearly similar to the inputs does not grant plausible\ndeniability, as any adversary could assume that much of the original\nsemantics has been preserved. Conversely, when a private output\ntext is often very distant from the original, an adversary could not\nsay with certainty what the original text content could have been.\nThe indistinguishability metric is measured by first calculating\nthe sentence embeddings of each document in the private output\ndataset. We perform this using Sentence Transformers [35], specifi-\ncally the all-MiniLM-L12-v2 model3. Then, in an iterative fashion,\neach text from the original (non-sanitized) dataset counterpart is\nembedded, and a nearest neighbor search is performed to calculate\nat which \ud835\udc58the true private counterpart to the original text is the\n\ud835\udc58th nearest neighbor. The \ud835\udc58for each (original, private) pair is aver-\naged for the whole dataset, and the resulting indistinguishability\nscore is represented as a percentage of the size of the dataset. For\nexample, in a dataset with 100 texts, a score of 0 would imply that\nthe private text is always the closest semantically to the original\n(the nearest neighbor), whereas a score of 1 would imply strong\nindistinguishability, as the original and private texts are always\nsemantically distant (100th nearest neighbor).\nTo accommodate the different dataset sizes, we set the max \ud835\udc58\nvalue to be the size of each respective dataset. For nearest neighbor\nsearch, we utilize semantic_search from Sentence Transformers.\n3.3.2\nUtility Evaluation. The utility evaluation consists of down-\nstream task performance measurement (in the case of YR and MHB),\nas well as the calculation of semantic similarity and coherence of\nthe sanitized texts. These evaluations paint a picture of the impact\nof sanitization on the usefulness of the text, and they also enable\nthe calculation of the privacy-utility trade-off.\nDownstream task performance (Util). Since both YR and MHB\ncontain an associated downstream task (sentiment analysis and\nailment detection, respectively), we are able to measure the effect\nof text sanitization on downstream task performance. We fine-tune\n3https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L12-v2\n\n\nUnderstanding Contextual Vulnerability in Word-level Text Sanitization\nWPES \u201925, October 13\u201317, 2025, Taipei, Taiwan\na deberta-v3-base model on a 90% train split of all variants of\nthe YR and MHB datasets, for one and three epochs, respectively.\nIn particular, YR is used for a binary sentiment classification and\nMHB for a four-class classification task. The micro-F1 score on\nthe 10% test split is recorded (due to class imbalance), both for\nthe baseline (non-sanitized) and sanitized datasets. Each training\nand evaluation procedure is repeated three times to account for\nvariances in training, and the reported scores represent the average.\nSemantic similarity (SS). This metric refers to a representation\nof the similarity in meaning of two given texts. Typically, semantic\nsimilarity is measured by calculating the embeddings (vector repre-\nsentations) of two texts, and then measuring the cosine similarity\nbetween the two embeddings. Here, a score of 1 means perfect\nsimilarity, where a score of -1 denotes very distant meanings.\nAs with indistinguishability, we use Sentence Transformers with\nan all-MiniLM-L12-v2 model to compute the embeddings for all\nsanitized texts and their original counterparts. Then, we calculate\nthe cosine similarity between all of these pairs, averaging the results\nfor a single semantic similarity score per private dataset. Thus, we\nmeasure for each sanitization setting (dataset, mechanism, budget)\nthe average semantic similarity over all texts within the correspond-\ning dataset. This provides a broad overview of the preservation of\nsemantics (meaning), which lends to the utility of a dataset.\nText coherence (Co). A known limitation of word-level MLDP\nmethods is the tendency to produce output texts that are lacking\nin coherence or fluency, and moreover, that contain grammatical\nincorrectness or inconsistencies. As a proxy to capture the preser-\nvation of such coherence, we use the perplexity metric. In essence,\nperplexity mirrors text coherence by measuring how \u201csurprised\u201d a\nlanguage model is to see the next token over the tokens of a text.\nHigh perplexity indicates incorrect, inconsistent, or non-fluent writ-\ning, whereas low perplexity denotes that the text aligns well with\nthe language model\u2019s understanding of proper text.\nWe measure the mean perplexity of all texts in our private\ndatasets, i.e., the average of the perplexity scores for each sani-\ntized text in the dataset. As perplexity is reference-free (does not\nrequire comparison to a reference text), the original text counter-\npart is not taken into consideration. As the underlying language\nmodel, we use the GPT-2 model [34], following related works in\nDP NLP that also use perplexity in their evaluation [29, 41].\n3.3.3\nQuantifying the privacy-utility trade-off. An important con-\nsideration in the evaluation of any text privatization method, espe-\ncially those leveraging DP, comes with the relative gains of doing\nso, with respect to the potential utility losses incurred. This is often\nreferred to as the privacy-utility trade-off, and it can be calculated\nby directly weighing privacy gains against utility losses.\nDue to the direct comparability, we measure the observable\ntrade-offs when considering the defense against inference attacks\nand downstream task performance. We define U\ud835\udc5cto be the base-\nline utility score, which is represented as the downstream task\nperformance using the original, non-sanitized dataset. We also\ndefine U\ud835\udc5dto be the same utility score (F1) measured on the pri-\nvate datasets. Similarly, we define \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5cand \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5das the privacy scores,\nnamely the adversarial performance on the baseline and private\ndatasets, respectively. We thus define the privacy-utility trade-off\nas: TO = U\ud835\udc5d\nU\ud835\udc5c\u2212\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5d\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5c. In the case of the U calculation for Yelp, we ac-\ncount for the highly imbalanced dataset (towards positive reviews)\nby considering the utility change over majority-class guessing (MG),\nthus yielding U = U\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51\u2212U\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc3a, for both U\ud835\udc5cand U\ud835\udc5d.\nA positive \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc42score indicates that the privacy benefits of san-\nitization outweigh utility losses, whereas a negative score would\nimply the opposite. The strength (magnitude) of this score suggests\nhow clear the trade-off is. Since we use the defense against inference\nscores, we calculate \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc42for both the static and adaptive settings.\n4\nExperiment Results\nWe present the results of our experiments, beginning with a case\nstudy of the SanText mechanism, which reveals the impact of\nimposing document-level budgets during sanitization. Then, we\npresent the privacy and utility results of the remaining three mech-\nanisms, both before and after LLM-based reconstruction.\n4.1\nEnforcing Uniform Document-level MLDP:\nA Case Study with SanText\nAs introduced, we initiate our investigation with a case study of\nthe SanText mechanism, particularly to determine the impact\nthat bounding document-level privacy budgets has, in comparison\nto previous work which uses unbounded sanitization [39]. The\nfindings of this investigation serve to guide the remainder of this\nwork, where we evaluate the remaining three MLDP mechanisms.\n4.1.1\nInsights from bounding document budgets. The full results\nof the SanText case study are presented in Table 3. In first ana-\nlyzing the raw SanText results (pre-LLM), we find that in some\ncases, fixing document budgets (rather than unbounded per-word\nbudgets) leads to higher utility, but lower privacy. Relatedly, the\nbounded results can also produce private outputs that are more\nsemantically reminiscent of the original texts, while also producing\nmore coherent texts. As a result, the bounded results consistently\nlead to better trade-offs (as exhibited in the case of YR and MHB),\nshowing a potential benefit of ensuring uniform privacy budgets.\nWe caution, however, that this is not always the case, and in some\ndirect comparisons, the results are mixed (e.g., SS and Co for YR).\nThe data reconstruction process with the selected LLMs seems to\namplify some of these disparities, yet those resulting from bounded\nprivatization consistently show superior results in terms of seman-\ntic similarity and coherence. However, we observe in many cases\nthat defense against inference attacks (both static and adaptive) is\nweaker in the bounded privatization results, suggesting that this\nmay lead to a wider attack vector than the unbounded case.\nWe find a potential reason for the mixed results: the variability\nof document lengths. Since all of the texts in a dataset are of various\nlengths, fixing document-level privacy budgets to the average num-\nber of words will result in very long documents being privatized\nparticularly strictly, and rather short documents very leniently.\nWhile this is an inherent limitation of LDP across a dataset, the\nresults of Table 3 suggest that certain benefits do realize, perhaps\noutweighing the downsides of \u201cincongruous\u201d privatization.

Learning from the SanText case\nstudy, we continue with the investigation of the three other se-\nlected MLDP mechanisms, namely by using them in a bounded\nfashion. Beyond ensuring a theoretically correct and fair evalua-\ntion, we wish to observe whether the same trends surface when\nstudying the transition from original to private to reconstructed\ntext. This decision to enforce document-level budgets is particu-\nlarly supported by the observation of the resulting trade-off scores,\nwhere the bounded results nearly always exhibit similar or better\ntrade-offs than unbounded privatization.\nFrom the case study, we also learn of the importance of dataset\nand LLM in drawing conclusions about the effectiveness of the LLM\ncontextual inference. As an example, LLMs perform much better\n(namely, in recovering semantics) in the YR tasks than in MHB,\nand in YR, GPT-4o displays a clear advantage over Gemini-2.0.\nThese results demonstrate the importance of fundamental design\nchoices when setting up adversarial tasks, and we validate these\ndiscrepancies in studying the three further MLDP methods.\n4.2\nHow vulnerable are MLDP methods, and to\nwhat effect?\nFocusing on our three selected MLDP text sanitization methods, we\nsystematically report and analyze the results of our conducted ex-\nperiments, which follow the same structure as those in the SanText\ncase study. These results are reported in full in Table 4.\nHigh utility impact. Beginning with an analysis of the down-\nstream task performance (Util) results, one can see that attempting\nto reconstruct sanitized texts with LLMs has a significant impact on\nthe utility of the data. A clear example comes with the MHB dataset,\nwhere only one reconstruction setting can match the utlity scores\nof the original private data, and in some cases, utility drops of over\n10% (in F1) can be observed. Such large losses are not observed in\nYelp, but looking more closely, one can see that in all studied cases\n(private and LLM-reconstructed), the utility scores stagnate around\nthat of majority class guessing (i.e., positive reviews).\nIn only three of the 18 experimental configurations for YR does\nthe utility score of the reconstructed text outperform that of the\nDP text, and this occurs solely at \u201chigher\u201d privacy budgets with the\n1-Diffractor mechanism. As mentioned, a similar phenomenon\noccurs with MHB, where only one setting (1-Diffractor, GPT,\n\ud835\udf00= 2) outperforms the DP version of the text, which also greatly\nsurpasses the plaintext baseline. In these utility results, we see that\nthe utility of the reconstruction output is highly dependent on the\nretained utility of the DP text, where significant losses from the\nlatter can lead to further propagated loss in the former.\nRegained semantics and coherence. A clear outcome of the LLM\nreconstruction process is improved semantic similarity and text\ncoherence, which can be observed across the board for both tested\nLLMs and all selected datasets. In fact, there only exists one case\n(1-Diffractor, \ud835\udf00= 2) where an LLM result does not produce texts\nwith higher average semantic similarity to the original texts, and\nlikewise, there are zero cases in which at least one LLM-reconstructed\ndataset does not exhibit lower perplexity (coherence). As such, one\n\nUnderstanding Contextual Vulnerability in Word-level Text Sanitization\nWPES \u201925, October 13\u201317, 2025, Taipei, Taiwan\nTable 4: Results of the privacy and utility experiments involv-\ning the three selected MLDP mechanisms, the three selected\ndatasets, and all privacy budget settings.

contextual inference process (Fig-\nure 2) is quite capable at recovering semantics and restoring text\ncoherence, especially in the case of GPT-4o.\nThese effects are pronounced in stricter privacy settings (lower\nbase \ud835\udf00), where gains of over 10 percentage points can often be\nobserved. Similarly, restored text coherence is amplified in stricter\nprivacy regimes, where the original DP text privatization tends to\nproduce considerably less coherent text outputs. This, therefore,\npresents more ground for the LLM reconstruction process to regain.\nHowever, although the absolute gains may be higher for stricter\nprivacy regimes, the regained semantic similarity rarely reaches\nthat of the DP text of the next highest \ud835\udf00value, presenting the\nbenefits of stricter privacy parameters.\nThe curious case of privacy. An analysis of the privacy results\nyields an interesting investigation, as the experimental results do\nnot exhibit immediately clearly discernible or uniform patterns.\nWe begin with an analysis of the results with the DP texts and the\nreconstructed texts. With YR, GPT-4o texts outperform the MLDP\nprivacy scores on all settings with CMP and Maha, and especially\nin the adaptive attacker setting, the privacy gains are significant\n(much lower adversarial performance). Conversely, in these specific\nsettings, Gemini texts always lead to better adversarial performance.\nIn the case of 1-Diffractor, using LLMs leads to (quite significant)\nattacker success rates in five out of the six LLM settings.\nThe adaptive setting of MHB proves to be ineffective on all fronts,\nwhere the results suggest that all trained attacker models converge\nto majority class guessing. The static setting, however, shows high\ngains in all GPT-4o settings, and in nearly all Gemini-2.0 settings.\nThis effect is amplified in the EE dataset experiments, where LLM\nreconstruction improves static attacker performance in all settings.\nCuriously, this is met with the result that LLM reconstruction de-\ncreases adversarial performance in all-but-one LLM setting.\nThe indistinguishability (In) test results add some clarity to the\npicture. Referring back to the YR experiments, we see that an in-\ncrease in indistinguishability correlates well with a drop in adver-\nsarial performance, yet, a clear distinction can be made between\n\u201cstrict\u201d and \u201clenient\u201d privacy settings. In particular, with CMP and\nMaha, we see that the LLM reconstruction in the \ud835\udf00= 1 setting\nalways leads to higher indistinguishability, whereas this effect is\noften neutralized or even reversed with higher privacy budgets. We\nalso learn that some mechanisms, i.e., 1-Diffractor, are relatively\nmore vulnerable in the sense of losing plausible deniability, as LLM\nreconstruction always degrades the indistinguishability of DP texts.\nTrade-offs follow privacy effects. As a final point of analysis, we\nfind that LLM reconstruction can actually serve to increase the\nprivacy-utility trade-off, where at least one LLM result equals or out-\nperforms the original DP text in 11/18 static settings and 18/18 adap-\ntive settings. Looking deeper, we see that trade-off results largely\nfollow in the footsteps of the observed trends in defense against\ninference attacks (P), where the increased robustness against ad-\nversaries was particularly observed in the YR experiments.\nThese results imply that in many cases, the effect of LLM recon-\nstruction may indeed serve to strengthen the privacy protection of\nDP-sanitized text, more so than the potentially additional utility\nloss incurred. This, however, is met with some cases (particularly\nin MHB) where originally positive trade-offs in the DP texts are\nmade negative post-reconstruction. As such, the observed trade-\noffs become an important metric in tracking the shift in usefulness,\nnamely, who serves to gain from the reconstruction process.\n4.3\nAre Open-source LLMs More, Equally, or\nLess Effective?\nWe repeat the same series of experiments as reported above, but\nnow by using smaller, open-source LLMs, namely Llama-3.3-70B\n\nWPES \u201925, October 13\u201317, 2025, Taipei, Taiwan\nMeisenbacher et al.\nTable 5: Experimental results when using open-source LLMs,\nfollowing the same experimental procedure as presented in\nTables 3 and 4, with the best trade-off values bolded.\n(a) MHB\nCMP\nMaha\n1-Diffractor\n\ud835\udf00\n1\n10\n20\n1\n10\n20\n0.1\n1\n2\nOriginal\nUtil\n71.831.1\nP\n23.94\nMLDP\nUtil \u2191\n63.40.0\n63.41.1\n68.50.7\n63.40.0\n65.72.4\n71.40.7\n65.33.7\n69.52.4\n73.21.1\nSS \u2191\n0.079\n0.427\n0.687\n0.082\n0.367\n0.612\n0.494\n0.857\n0.929\nCo \u2193\u2193\n2500\n3050\n1817\n2505\n2990\n1925\n593\n167\n105\nP(s) \u2193\n11.27\n11.27\n18.31\n11.27\n11.27\n16.90\n22.54\n22.54\n25.35\nP(a) \u2193\n23.90.0\n23.90.0\n23.90.0\n23.90.0\n23.90.0\n23.90.0\n23.90.0\n23.90.0\n23.50.7\nIn \u2191\u2191\n0.410\n0.300\n0.142\n0.401\n0.313\n0.181\n0.081\n0.006\n0.004\nTO(s) \u2191\n0.41\n0.41\n0.19\n0.41\n0.44\n0.29\n-0.03\n0.03\n-0.04\nTO(a) \u2191\n-0.12\n-0.12\n-0.05\n-0.12\n-0.09\n-0.01\n-0.09\n-0.03\n0.04\nLlama\nUtil \u2191\n53.50.0\n52.61.3\n60.12.9\n53.50.0\n53.50.0\n62.05.3\n59.65.3\n65.31.8\n57.32.7\nSS \u2191\n0.408\n0.594\n0.741\n0.408\n0.558\n0.697\n0.673\n0.874\n0.916\nCo \u2193\n11\n18\n144\n9\n17\n54\n45\n36\n39\nP(s) \u2193\n23.94\n23.94\n22.54\n23.94\n23.94\n23.94\n25.35\n25.35\n23.94\nP(a) \u2193\n23.90.0\n23.90.0\n23.90.0\n23.90.0\n23.90.0\n23.90.0\n23.90.0\n23.90.0\n23.90.0\nIn \u2191\n0.413\n0.141\n0.072\n0.413\n0.173\n0.092\n0.031\n0.003\n0.003\nTO(s) \u2191\n-0.12\n-0.12\n0.01\n-0.12\n-0.09\n-0.01\n-0.15\n-0.09\n0.02\nTO(a) \u2191\n-0.12\n-0.12\n-0.05\n-0.12\n-0.09\n-0.01\n-0.09\n-0.03\n0.02\nGemma\nUtil \u2191\n52.61.3\n54.92.0\n53.51.1\n53.50.0\n54.51.3\n55.92.4\n52.12.0\n49.84.6\n63.81.8\nSS \u2191\n0.360\n0.570\n0.717\n0.338\n0.533\n0.673\n0.559\n0.854\n0.921\nCo \u2193\n70\n227\n692\n225\n300\n660\n363\n142\n90\nP(s) \u2193\n23.94\n18.31\n19.72\n21.13\n22.54\n25.35\n23.94\n22.54\n25.35\nP(a) \u2193\n23.90.0\n23.90.0\n23.90.0\n23.90.0\n23.90.0\n23.90.0\n23.90.0\n23.90.0\n23.90.0\nIn \u2191\n0.436\n0.179\n0.101\n0.428\n0.214\n0.118\n0.091\n0.005\n0.004\nTO(s) \u2191\n-0.12\n0.12\n0.13\n-0.00\n-0.03\n-0.07\n-0.09\n0.03\n-0.04\nTO(a) \u2191\n-0.12\n-0.12\n-0.05\n-0.12\n-0.09\n-0.01\n-0.09\n-0.03\n0.02\n(b) EE\nCMP\nMaha\n1-Diffractor\n\ud835\udf00\n1\n10\n20\n1\n10\n20\n0.1\n1\n2\nOriginal\nP\n38.03\nMLDP\nSS \u2191\n0.160\n0.624\n0.817\n0.159\n0.559\n0.767\n0.547\n0.901\n0.952\nCo \u2193\n4143\n2488\n1028\n4070\n2718\n1235\n926\n290\n233\nP(s) \u2193\n7.00\n11.89\n14.66\n7.41\n12.21\n13.36\n8.71\n12.95\n13.84\nP(a) \u2193\n20.94.7\n28.41.5\n33.31.5\n21.61.6\n28.91.3\n30.30.2\n26.64.6\n36.02.1\n37.31.6\nIn \u2191\n0.302\n0.090\n0.030\n0.304\n0.103\n0.040\n0.018\n0.000\n0.000\nLlama\nSS \u2191\n0.172\n0.634\n0.824\n0.181\n0.577\n0.780\n0.616\n0.904\n0.944\nCo \u2193\n1568\n482\n216\n1525\n422\n239\n174\n98\n90\nP(s) \u2193\n10.26\n24.35\n29.56\n11.56\n22.48\n28.09\n28.83\n32.49\n32.09\nP(a) \u2193\n10.31.5\n25.20.4\n31.91.0\n11.41.7\n22.03.7\n30.02.1\n29.52.0\n35.62.2\n37.30.9\nIn \u2191\n0.333\n0.080\n0.023\n0.326\n0.091\n0.030\n0.010\n0.000\n0.000\nGemma\nSS \u2191\n0.182\n0.629\n0.818\n0.185\n0.568\n0.768\n0.555\n0.898\n0.948\nCo \u2193\n493\n661\n424\n442\n760\n536\n748\n232\n191\nP(s) \u2193\n11.40\n22.64\n25.81\n10.75\n22.72\n25.90\n13.68\n19.38\n20.60\nP(a) \u2193\n11.01.0\n25.11.7\n30.21.8\n11.51.8\n23.91.7\n30.42.3\n23.92.7\n36.02.3\n34.24.0\nIn \u2191\n0.351\n0.079\n0.025\n0.348\n0.095\n0.035\n0.019\n0.000\n0.000\nand Gemma-27B. The results of these experiments, which were run\non MHB and EE, are provided in Table 5.\nBeginning with utility, we find several cases in direct comparison\nto Table 4 where open-source LLM reconstruction retains higher\nutility (measured in downstream task performance), and similar\nresults can be observed for semantic similarity and coherence. This\nis considerable, especially with the large gap in model size difference\nbetween the utilized open-source and closed-source LLMs.\nIn privacy preservation, however, the open-source LLMs perform\nclearly worse in comparison to those of Table 4, where not a single\ncase exists where the best open-source result outperforms the best\nof the closed-source LLMs in the static setting, and only 2/9 direct\ncomparisons in the adaptive setting. The indistinguishability results\nare mixed when comparing the two groups, with no clear winner.\nThe merits of using open-source models, whether for adversarial\npurposes or not, are validated, as the results are comparable and\nsometimes significantly better, despite the large disparity in model\nparameters. This becomes especially significant when considering\nthe resources required to run each set of models, as well as the\nimportant consideration that open-source models can be run locally,\nwhich carries implications in the case of handling sensitive data.\n5\nDiscussion\nWe reflect on the findings of our work, beginning with a qualitative\nanalysis of the effects of LLM data reconstruction of word-level\nMLDP, then continuing with a discussion of the dangers and merits\nof contextual vulnerability. These give rise to concrete recommen-\ndations for the future study and application of word-level MLDP.\n5.1\nA Qualitative View of Text Reconstruction\nWe begin with an exploration of the question: what actually happens\nduring LLM text reconstruction of DP-sanitized texts? For this, we first\nqualitatively compare selected text examples from the EE datasets,\nfor both \u201cstrict\u201d and \u201clenient\u201d privacy budgets in SanText and\nCMP. These examples are found in Table 6. Here, one can observe\nthat in stricter privacy settings (lower \ud835\udf00), LLM reconstruction is\nmore prone to \u201cinherit\u201d incorrect information, i.e., sanitization\n\u201cremnants\u201d, rather than correct information from the original texts.\nIn contrast, sanitization with higher \ud835\udf00values leaves more correct\ncontextual clues behind, and LLM reconstruction is more capable of\ndetecting these and reconstructing the remaining context around\nthem. Nevertheless, in all cases, we see that sanitization introduces\nperturbations which cause LLMs to be misled contextually.\nTo represent the effect of LLM reconstruction graphically, we\ntake a random sample of 100 texts from the YR dataset, selecting\ntexts from this subset which are written by the top-3 most frequent\nauthors. We then embed these texts using all-MiniLM-L12-v2\nand use PCA to project the embeddings down to two principal\ncomponents. Following this process, we plot the original texts, the\nCMP sanitized texts (with all three \ud835\udf00budgets), and the respective\nreconstructed texts for GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0. The results are\ndisplayed in Figure 4. As can be seen, the reconstruction process\nhas a double-edged effect. Strict sanitization results in highly dense\nclusters (i.e., partially indistinguishable, yet not usable), and recon-\nstruction serves to \u201cdisperse\u201d these clusters, while still maintaining\nindistinguishability yet also inadvertently masking the utility signal\n(i.e., sentiment). These results are confirmed by the scores observed\nin Table 4. This effect can vary depending on the strength of saniti-\nzation; lenient sanitization may not properly privatize texts enough\nto mask authorship, and reconstruction can only partially correct\nfor this. A prime example is that of the green author in Figure\n4, where reconstructing \ud835\udf00= 1 and \ud835\udf00= 10 helps to disperse texts\n(i.e., increase semantic diversity), yet continue to mask authorship,\nwhereas this author is still quite delineable in \ud835\udf00= 20.\nThus, the double-edged sword takes on two meanings, firstly in\nthe way that reconstruction can bolster privacy but also degrade\nutility further. Secondly, reconstruction may be most beneficial\n(from a protection point of view) at lower \ud835\udf00values, whereas initially\nweak \ud835\udf00sanitization benefits from reconstruction to a lesser degree.\n5.2\nThe Dangers and Merits\nThis discussion highlights clear dangers and merits of modeling\nadversaries to perform LLM-based text reconstruction by exploiting\ncontextual vulnerability. The dangers include those stemming from\ntoo weak privatization (high \ud835\udf00), where results throughout Tables\n3, 4, and 5 indicate that this can lead to regained semantics and\ndegraded robustness to adversarial inference, while also reducing\nusefulness in downstream tasks. This, however, is model-specific,\nas different LLMs exhibit differing impacts on privacy and utility.\nThe benefits of \u201cthinking like an adversary\u201d are clear, though, and\nwe learn that modeling this adversarial task can serve to strengthen\n\nUnderstanding Contextual Vulnerability in Word-level Text Sanitization\nWPES \u201925, October 13\u201317, 2025, Taipei, Taiwan\nTable 6: A selected text example from the EE dataset, sanitized texts in both a \u201cstrict\u201d and \u201clenient\u201d privacy setting for two\nMLDP mechanisms, and the reconstructed counterparts from GPT-4o.

How are things?\nFigure 3: Token count shift between private texts and their\nLLM-reconstructed counterparts, over all studied datasets.\nThe y-axis (shift) measures the token length difference be-\ntween LLM output and DP text input. The green arrows de-\nnote the observed means, and outliers have been removed.\nDP-sanitized texts further, improving coherence and semantic sim-\nilarity, increasing defense against adversarial inference, boosting\nplausible deniability, and sometimes leading to better privacy-utility\ntrade-offs. This not only broadens the understanding of the vulner-\nability explored by Tong et al. [39], but also challenges the notion\nthat (partial) data reconstruction is necessarily harmful. In addition,\nwe note that the reconstruction process also addresses a crucial lim-\nitation of composing word-level MLDP perturbations, namely that\noutput documents are identical in length to their original counter-\nparts [24]. We show in Figure 3 that LLM reconstruction introduces\nvariability in output texts, further bolstering plausible deniability\nand removing the contextual clue of text length. These benefits are\nsignificant and clear, especially in addressing known limitations\nof word-level DP (including poor text coherence and grammatical\nincorrectness); however, this is not universal, suggesting that real-\nizing such benefits is a matter of careful design, model selection,\nand importantly, the nature of the underlying data to be sanitized.\n5.3\nLLM-based Reconstruction For Good?\nWith the potential benefits of running LLM reconstruction on DP-\nsanitized texts, the question becomes how to reason about this step\nin the context of DP and whether doing so inherently harms the\nDP guarantees of the private texts. The foundations of DP provide\na solution for this, in the form of the post-processing property of\nDP. Intuitively, this property states that any arbitrary computations\nperformed on DP outputs will still be DP. Formally, if F (\ud835\udc65) is \ud835\udf00-DP,\n\ud835\udc54(F (\ud835\udc65)) is also \ud835\udf00-DP, for any \ud835\udc54. Post-processing has been lever-\naged in various DP applications [5, 22], and has been preliminarily\nexplored in the context of text sanitization [29].\nWith this, the addition of data reconstruction to the DP san-\nitization process can be viewed as a post-processing step, in that\nDP texts can be semantically \u201crealigned\u201d and made more coherent,\nwhile potentially improving robustness against adversaries before\nreleasing the data. This, of course, is dependent on the effective-\nness of the reconstruction pipeline settings, and in this light, we\npropose a series of recommendations for effective post-processing\nof word-level MLDP, presented in the following.\n5.4\nRecommendations\nFollowing from the above discussion and grounded in the results of\nour experiments, we propose a set of recommendations for the in-\ntegration of LLM-assisted text reconstruction as a post-processing\n\nToken Count Shift\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n\u00a9\n\n\u201420\n\n\u201430\n\nGPT-40\n\nGemini-2.0\n\nLLM\n\nLlama-3.3-70B\n\nGemma-27B\n\nWPES \u201925, October 13\u201317, 2025, Taipei, Taiwan\nMeisenbacher et al.\nFigure 4: An illustration of the topological transformation of texts after privatization and after reconstruction. We select 100\nrandom texts from the Yelp dataset, and then limit this subset to the three most frequent authors (represented in red, blue, and\ngreen). The sparsity and delineability of the clusters implies contextual vulnerability, and as can be seen, data reconstruction\nwith LLMs can serve to \u201cobscure\u201d the results, depending on the strength of DP. This comes at the cost of less discernible utility\nattributes, such as sentiment, especially in the transformation of private to reconstructed texts.\nstep after word-level MLDP sanitization. In particular, we propose\nthese steps as a means to \u201cget ahead of adversaries\u201d, in that perform-\ning reconstruction in optimally tuned settings may serve to reduce\nthe attack surface of malicious entities following data release.\nAs such, we propose the following steps for the safe and effective\nemployment of MLDP methods:\n(1) Sanitize the text dataset in question with a chosen MLDP\nmechanism at a reasonably low \ud835\udf00, which can be determined\nthrough trial and error testing.\n(2) With a set of defined utility and privacy metrics (such as\nthose used in this work), run experimental tests on an array\nof chosen LLMs (open-source only, if necessary), determin-\ning which LLM configuration optimizes the desired metrics.\nPrivacy or utility can naturally be weighed accordingly.\n(3) Leverage the optimal LLM reconstruction configuration to\ntransform the DP texts as a post-processing step.\n(4) Release the post-processed texts.\nWith these steps, we envision that known limitations of word-\nlevel MLDP can be effectively addressed, while also strengthening\nthe privacy protections offered by DP text sanitization.\n6\nConclusion\nIn this work, we broaden the understanding of exploiting contextual\nvulnerability in word-level DP text sanitization methods, particu-\nlarly by leveraging simple, yet effective LLM-based reconstruction\nprompts. We find that launching such \u201cattacks\u201d is not necessarily\nalways harmful, but rather, can be leveraged effectively to improve\nsemantic reminiscence to the original, non-private texts while also\nincreasing text coherence and boosting robustness against adver-\nsarial inference attacks. These findings shed light on the potential\nof text reconstruction as a crucial post-processing step in bolstering\nthe quality and empirical privacy protections of DP texts, particu-\nlarly when fine-tuned to a particular use case.\nLimitations. We acknowledge several limitations that pertain to\nour work, the primary of which is grounded in our use of solely\npublicly available datasets. As such, we do not control or test for\nthe effects of data contamination [6], where some of the utilized\nLLMs could have seen these datasets during their training. Thus,\nwe caution the reader to interpret our results accordingly, as data\ncontamination could have skewed some of the observed scores.\nDespite our efforts to choose a representative sample of word-\nlevel MLDP mechanisms, we do not perform comprehensive tests\non all available mechanisms, and furthermore, we do not extend\nour experiments to DP mechanisms beyond the word level. LLM-\nbased data reconstruction should therefore be tested on further\nmechanisms, datasets, and LLMs to generalize our findings.\nFuture Work. We see it as important to continue the study of\nusable word-level DP, from the perspective of addressing key limita-\ntions, and also in understanding and mitigating potential threats to\nits effectiveness. Therefore, we hope that future work will continue\nto explore ways by which LLMs can both harm and help (DP) text\nsanitization, such that a deeper understanding of emergent threats\nto DP sheds light on innovative techniques for mitigation.\n\nsentiment sentiment sentiment\n@ positive @ positive @ positive\n# negative % negative \u00b0 # negative\n\nsentiment sentiment sentiment sentiment\n@ positive @ positive @ positive @ positive\n% negative e * negative % negative in % negative\n\nsentiment sentiment sentiment\ne Positive \u2018 @ positive - - @ positive\n# negative \u00ae negative #\u00ae negative\n\n\nUnderstanding Contextual Vulnerability in Word-level Text Sanitization\nWPES \u201925, October 13\u201317, 2025, Taipei, Taiwan\nReferences\n[1] M\u00e1rio Alvim, Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis, Catuscia Palamidessi, and Anna\nPazii. 2018.

  "pdfs/2508.18929v1.pdf": "Diverse And Private Synthetic Datasets Generation for\nRAG evaluation: A multi-agent framework\nIlias DRIOUICH1, Hongliu CAO1 and Eoin THOMAS1\n1AMADEUS France\nAbstract\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems improve large language model outputs by incorporating external\nknowledge, enabling more informed and context-aware responses. However, the effectiveness and trustworthiness\nof these systems critically depends on how they are evaluated, particularly on whether the evaluation process\ncaptures real-world constraints like protecting sensitive information. While current evaluation efforts for RAG\nsystems have primarily focused on the development of performance metrics, far less attention has been given to\nthe design and quality of the underlying evaluation datasets, despite their pivotal role in enabling meaningful,\nreliable assessments. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework for generating synthetic QA\ndatasets for RAG evaluation that prioritize semantic diversity and privacy preservation. Our approach involves:\n(1) a Diversity agent leveraging clustering techniques to maximize topical coverage and semantic variability,\n(2) a Privacy Agent that detects and mask sensitive information across multiple domains and (3) a QA curation\nagent that synthesizes private and diverse QA pairs suitable as ground truth for RAG evaluation. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our evaluation sets outperform baseline methods in diversity and achieve robust\nprivacy masking on domain-specific datasets. This work offers a practical and ethically aligned pathway toward\nsafer, more comprehensive RAG system evaluation, laying the foundation for future enhancements aligned with\nevolving AI regulations and compliance standards.\nKeywords\nMulti-Agent system, Privacy-preserving, Evaluation system, Synthetic Dataset Generation,\n1. Introduction\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) aims to improve large language models (LLM) output by in-\ncorporating relevant information retrieved from external knowledge sources. It has been effectively\napplied in various scenarios, such as domain-specific chatbots [1, 2] and email/code completion [3]. A\ntypical RAG system often operates in two stages: retrieval and generation. First, the system retrieves the\nrelevant knowledge from an external database based on the user query. Then, the retrieved information\nis integrated with the query to form an input for the LLM in charge of the generation stage. The LLM\nuses its pre-trained knowledge and the retrieval data to generate a response, enhancing the overall\nquality of the output. As RAG sees wider adoption, ensuring robust performance evaluation becomes\ncritical. While numerous automated methods, ranging from classic n-gram metrics (BLEU, ROUGE) and\nembedding-based measures (BERTScore)[4] to the \u201cLLM-as-a-judge\u201d approach leveraging GPT have\nbeen explored, an equally vital element is having the \u201cgolden\u201d evaluation set with sufficiently diverse\nand representative samples that will serve as a complete benchmark to evaluate both the retrieval and\ngeneration processes [5]. Furthermore, despite the emergence of multiple RAG benchmarks [6, 7, 8]\nthat span general-purpose and specialized domains, many still fall short of reflecting the complexity\nand variability of real-world use cases. In particular, traditional benchmarks often lack coverage of\nnovel or underrepresented topics, limiting their ability to generalize [2, 9]. This gap poses a significant\nchallenge for reliable evaluation, especially in domains requiring deep expertise and factual precision\n[10].\nTo address these challenges, a new line of work consisting in generating synthetic evaluation sets\nTRUST-AI: The European Workshop on Trustworthy AI. Organized as part of the European Conference of Artificial Intelligence -\nECAI 2025. October 2025, Bologna, Italy.\n*Corresponding author.\n$ ilias.driouich@amadeus.com (I. DRIOUICH)\n\u00a9 2025 Copyright for this paper by its authors. Use permitted under Creative Commons License Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0).\n\n[11] has emerged and is very promising. Indeed, these methods offer a practical solution for generating\ndatasets that mimic real human interactions by leveraging advanced LLM reasoning capabilities. Such\nsynthetic datasets can include a broad range of scenarios, from straightforward factual questions to\nmore nuanced domain-specific ones enabling robust and comprehensive evaluation of RAG systems.\nAdditionally, synthetic data generation methods are increasingly recognized as vital components for the\nsafe, transparent, and compliant evaluation of AI systems. In fact, regulatory frameworks, such as the\nEuropean Union\u2019s AI Act [12], explicitly promote the use of synthetic datasets within AI compliance\nand auditing processes. However, maintaining both a high efficiency of privacy-preserving mechanisms\nin retrieval systems and adherence to privacy regulations remains essential to building reliable and\nethical evaluation frameworks.\nIn fact, according to the existing literature [13, 14], retrieval systems may face serious privacy issues\nwhen the retrieval process involves sensitive data. For example, the authors in [13] observe that\ncarefully designed user prompts are able to extract original sentences from the retrieval data or can also\nextract specific pieces of private information, potentially leading to the leakage of considerable amounts\nof retrieval data. The potential risk of information leakage can significantly limit the applications\nof retrieval systems. For example, a medical chatbot [15] using patient history diagnosis cases as a\nsource of knowledge can improve response quality but raises concerns about exposing sensitive patient\ninformation.\nIn this work, we take the first step toward exploring the generation of diverse and privacy-aware\nsynthetic QA datasets designed specifically to serve as evaluation ground truth for assessing RAG\nsystems. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We introduce a modular and extensible multi-agent pipeline for synthetic QA dataset generation,\ndesigned specifically for evaluating RAG systems while ensuring a balance between diversity,\nprivacy, and utility.\n\u2022 We develop and perform a comprehensive twofold evaluation strategy: (1) diversity assessment\ncombining qualitative judgments from LLM-based evaluators and quantitative diversity metrics,\nand (2) privacy assessment focused on the accuracy and effectiveness of entity masking across\nthree specialized datasets.\n2. Related works\n2.1. Retrieval-augmented generation and privacy issues\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation , introduced by [16], has gained substantial traction for enhancing LLM\nresponses through external context. By retrieving relevant documents or passages and incorporating\nthem into the prompt, RAG often yields output with improved accuracy and factual grounding [17],\nmitigating the well-documented \u201challucination\u201d problem in LLMs [18]. In addition to higher-quality\noutputs, RAG offers architectural flexibility by allowing independent upgrades to any of its components\n(e.g., data storage, retriever, or the core LLM) without requiring full model retraining [19, 20]. These\nadvantages have led to the adoption of RAG in diverse settings, from personal chatbots to highly\nspecialized expert systems [21].\nDespite its clear benefits, the retrieval process introduces privacy risks, particularly in domains\nhandling sensitive user data. For instance, [22] highlight privacy implications of retrieval-based language\nmodels, showing how training data and user inputs can be unintentionally exposed through retrieved\npassages. Other works have demonstrated that RAG models are susceptible to extraction attacks [13],\nincluding membership inference and reconstruction attacks, which exploit learned representations\nto infer whether a user\u2019s data was part of the training set [23]. Such vulnerabilities pose significant\nchallenges for deploying RAG-based solutions in sensitive applications (e.g., healthcare, finance) where\ndata privacy is paramount.\n\n2.2. Synthetic data generation using Large Language Models\nRecent advances in LLMs have created significant interest in using them to automatically generate\nsynthetic data. For instance, [24, 25] utilize zero-shot prompting to produce synthetic samples for\ntasks such as text classification and question answering, subsequently training smaller models on this\ngenerated data. [26] introduce a noise-robust re-weighting framework to further refine data quality,\nwhile [27] propose mixing a set of soft prompts and applying prompt tuning to enhance diversity in\nthe generated text. Beyond prompt-based methods, [28] examine specific attributes of the data itself,\nsuch as length and style, to diversify synthetic outputs. In parallel, a growing line of work has begun to\naddress privacy concerns in synthetic data generation.\nThe authors in [29] propose a few-shot approach, generating private in-context demonstrations\nbacked by differential privacy guarantees, and [30] design a private evolution algorithm that enforces\ndifferential privacy throughout the generation process. In [31], the authors propose a novel two-stage\nsynthetic pipeline that includes attribute-based data generation, which aims to maintain key information,\nand iterative agent-based refinement, which further enhances the privacy of the input data in RAG\nsystems.\n2.3. Synthetic question answer generation (QAG) and RAG evaluation\nA new wave of QAG and RAG evaluation approaches is redefining the field through synthetic data\ngeneration and dynamic assessment methods powered by LLMs. Rather than relying on static, human-\ncurated datasets, recent efforts leverage LLMs to generate QA pairs and evaluate model outputs using\nautomated scoring mechanisms, such as LLM-as-a-judge frameworks. Systems like RAGAS [11] support\nscalable, domain-adaptable evaluation by conditioning synthetic QA generation on retrieved context\nand employing flexible, model-driven evaluation criteria. These methods offer the advantage of tailoring\nevaluation to specific domains and evolving data distributions. However, they also introduce new chal-\nlenges, including maintaining content diversity, ensuring output consistency, and protecting sensitive\ninformation, particularly when operating over proprietary or privacy-sensitive corpora. Our work\nbuilds upon this emerging paradigm by incorporating explicit mechanisms to address these concerns,\ncontributing a privacy and and diversity-aware framework for RAG evaluation.\n3. The proposed solution\nAlgorithm 1 formally outlines the multi-agent procedure, detailing the sequential interaction between\nthe diversity agent, privacy Agent, and QA curation agent. Given an input dataset \ud835\udc37and clustering\nhyperparameters, the process outputs a set of synthetic QA samples \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc34, enriched with semantic\ndiversity and reinforced by privacy protections.\nIn the first step, the Diversity agent clusters the original dataset using semantic embeddings and\nselects representative samples from each cluster, ensuring a broad coverage of topics. The second step,\nthe privacy agent, operates over each cluster\u2019s representative samples, detecting and pseudonymizing\nsensitive entities to produce a private version of the data along with a structured privacy report. Finally,\nthe QA curation agent synthesizes question-answer pairs from the private data, generating evaluation-\nready samples along with a QA generation report that summarizes success rates and generation\ndynamics.\n4. Experiments\n4.1. Experimental Setup\nImplementation details\nAll components of our multi-agent framework were implemented in Python,\nusing the LangGraph framework to orchestrate inter-agent communication and control flow.

Specifically, we used GPT-4o\nfor the Diversity agent and the QA curation agent, due to its fast response time and strong gener-\nalization capabilities for content generation. For the privacy agent, we used GPT-4.1, which offers\nsuperior reasoning and tool-usage capabilities that are crucial for accurate PII detection and trans-\nformation tasks involving interaction with APIs or complex instructions. To ensure reproducibility\nand minimize variability in outputs, the temperature of all language models was fixed at 0 during\ninference. For the clustering process in the diversity agent, we generated embeddings using OpenAI\u2019s\ntext-embedding-3-small (Ada 3) model with an embedding dimension of 1536. Input documents\nwere preprocessed into chunks of 256 tokens before applying \ud835\udc58-means clustering.\nAgents tool configuration\nEach agent in the system operates with tailored tools suited to its\nobjectives. First, the diversity agent uses a \ud835\udc58-means clustering function to identify latent topic clusters\nwithin the input document. The optimal value of \ud835\udc58is selected using intra-cluster distance scores.\nSecond, the privacy agent performs pseudonymization based on a predefined set of PII categories.\nIt scans the generated content, identifies sensitive entities, and replaces them using context-aware\ntransformations. In addition, it produces a structured privacy report detailing which PIIs were correctly\ndetected, masked, or missed.\nLast, the QA curator agent generates final QA pairs from the enriched, privacy-preserved inputs\n\nby leveraging advanced prompting techniques. It also produces a comprehensive generation report\nsummarizing the types of QA pairs created, their alignment with source content, and overall dataset\ncharacteristics.\n4.2. Research question 1: How does the proposed multi-agent system enhance the\ndiversity of the generated evaluation dataset?\n4.2.1. Baselines\nTo assess the effectiveness of our proposed multi-agent approach in enhancing dataset diversity, we\ncompare against two baselines:\n(1)\nEvolutionary generation (RagasGen). Inspired by works such as Evol-Instruct and RAGAS [11],\nthis baseline uses an evolutionary generation paradigm to produce QA pairs. It iteratively mutates\nand refines questions to maximize diversity along dimensions such as reasoning complexity, multi-hop\ndependencies, and topic breadth.\n(2)\nDirect Prompting (DirPmpt). This baseline uses direct LLM prompting with few shot examples. A\nGPT-4o model is prompted with handcrafted instructions to produce diverse QA pairs.\n4.2.2. Diversity evaluation dataset\nTo evaluate our multi-agent framework\u2019s ability to generate diverse QA pairs, we use the official EU\nAI Act as input. Its rich structure and varied content provide a realistic and challenging testbed for\nassessing diversity in synthetic evaluation sets.\n4.2.3. Diversity evaluation methodology\nTo assess the diversity of the generated QA sets, we use the LLM-as-a-Judge approach, where GPT-4.1\nis prompted to act as an expert evaluator. The model receives pairs of evaluation sets, our generated set\nand baseline sets, along with instructions to judge question diversity based on semantic variety, topical\ncoverage, and phrasing differences. It then assigns diversity scores on a scale from 1 to 10. Additionally,\nwe use the CosineSimilaritytoDiversity[32], which inverts the average pairwise cosine similarity of\nsentence embeddings, lower values indicate greater semantic spread.\n4.2.4. Findings discussion\nFirst, we observe that our multi-agent system outperforms RagasGen and DirPrmpt in all evaluated\nsettings, with consistent gains observed across both qualitative and quantitative metrics.\nFurthermore, we observe a consistent trend across all diversity measures: as the test set size increases,\nso does the diversity of the generated questions. The LLM-as-a-Judge scores (GPT-4.1) rise from 7.8 at 10\nsamples to 9 at 100 samples, indicating that the generated question sets increasingly exhibit richer topic\ncoverage and variation in structure. Quantitatively, the CosineSim2toDiversity score becomes less\nnegative (closer to zero), reflecting that questions are increasingly dissimilar to each other, a direct\nproxy for higher diversity. These results demonstrate that our multi-agent system enhances question\ndiversity, particularly at larger scales.\n\nQA set size\nGPT-4.1 Diversity Rating\nCosine Sim. to Diversity\nOurs\nRagasGen\nDirPmpt\nOurs\nRagasGen\nDirPmpt\n10\n7.8\n7.0\n6.2\n-0.36\n-0.40\n-0.45\n25\n8.2\n7.3\n6.3\n-0.31\n-0.38\n-0.43\n50\n8.6\n7.4\n6.9\n-0.26\n-0.36\n-0.38\n75\n8.9\n8.0\n7.5\n-0.18\n-0.34\n-0.35\n100\n9.0\n8.1\n7.6\n-0.15\n-0.33\n-0.33\nTable 1\nDiversity and similarity metrics comparison between question sets generated by our method, RagasGen, and\nDirPmpt.\n4.3. Research Question 2: How does the proposed multi-agent solution preserve the\noverall privacy of the system?\n4.3.1. Privacy evaluation datasets\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the privacy agent, we use three benchmark datasets provided by\nAI4Privacy1: PII-Masking-200K, PWI-Masking-200K, and PHI-Masking-200K. These tabular\ndatasets contain long-form sentences annotated with private entities from different domains. The PWI\ndataset includes job titles, company names, and salary information. The PHI dataset focuses on medical\ndiagnoses, genetic information, and gender. The PII dataset contains names, locations, dates of birth,\nand contact details. Each dataset also provides additional metadata such as entity type, position, and\nfrequency.\nTo simulate realistic input conditions for our pipeline, we concatenated individual samples from each\ndataset into longer text paragraphs. We refer to each resulting dataset as PWI, PHI, or PII. Each consists\nof domain-specific long sentences containing private entities and their corresponding masked versions.\nTable 2 summarizes the main statistics for each dataset, including document length and the number of\nprivate entities.\nDataset\nDataset length (sentences)\nTotal entities number\nAvg entities per sentence\nPWI\n1800\n451\n3.99\nPHI\n1700\n422\n4.02\nPII\n1600\n591\n2.71\nTable 2\nStatistics of the constructed privacy evaluation datasets.\n4.3.2. Experimental results\nIn Figure 1 we present label-wise accuracy across the PHI, PWI, and PII datasets The privacy agent\nshows strong overall performance, with most labels achieving accuracies between 0.75 and 0.90. On the\nPHI dataset, the highest scores are observed for DISABILITYSTATUS (0.91), HOSPITALNAME (0.90),\nand MENTALHEALTHINFO (0.90), indicating robust handling of sensitive medical information. On\nthe PWI dataset, the model performs best on JOBTYPE (0.94), TELEPHONENUM (0.90), and DATE,\nGENDER, SALARY, ORGANISATION, DBAREA (all 0.88), demonstrating high reliability in identifying\nentities related to the workplace. Moreover, results on the PII dataset highlight strong performance for\nLASTNAME (0.91), CARDNUMBER and CITY (0.87), and FIRSTNAME, STATE, and JOBAREA (all 0.86),\nconfirming the agent\u2019s effectiveness in detecting general personal identifiers.\nInterestingly, overlapping labels such as GENDER appear across PHI (0.83), PWI (0.88), and PII\n(0.83), and yield consistently strong scores. This suggests that the privacy agent generalizes well across\n1https://huggingface.co/ai4privacy\n\ndomains.\nFigure 1: Privacy agent accuracy per entity type across the PHI, PWI, and PII datasets.\n5. Conclusion and future work\nIn this work, we introduced a modular multi-agent framework for the generation of synthetic QA\ndatasets tailored to the rigorous evaluation of RAG systems. Our approach decomposes the dataset\nconstruction process into distinct, specialized agents, each focused on enriching semantic diversity,\nenforcing privacy safeguards, and curating high-quality QA pairs. Through comprehensive experiments\nwe highlight the framework\u2019s effectiveness in producing evaluation datasets that are both representative\nand privacy-preserving, addressing critical challenges in real-world RAG evaluation.\nLooking ahead, we aim to enhance the autonomy and collaboration of individual agents by leveraging\ntool-augmented foundation models. For example, the diversity agent could dynamically infer optimal\nclustering structures, while the privacy agent could adaptively identify and transform PIIs beyond\nstatic entity lists. In addition, we plan to explore agent-to-agent communication protocols and effective\nindependent agent collaboration, potentially through frameworks like model context protocol, to\nimprove coordination and task delegation among agents.\nFuture work will also include rigorous evaluation of the framework\u2019s resilience to privacy attacks,\nhelping to clarify its defensive boundaries and inform improvements. As AI regulations such as the EU\nAI Act continue to evolve, subsequent versions of our framework will further align synthetic evaluation\nset generation not only with principles of technical trustworthiness, but also with emerging regulatory\nrequirements.\nReferences\n[1] S.

Our study\nexamines the presence of this type of polariza-\ntion in a selection of European parliaments in\na fully automated manner. Utilizing a com-\nprehensive corpus of parliamentary speeches\nfrom the parliaments of six European coun-\ntries, we employ natural language processing\ntechniques to estimate parliamentarian senti-\nment. By comparing the levels of negativity\nconveyed in references to individuals from op-\nposing groups versus one\u2019s own, we discover\npatterns of affectively polarized interactions.\nThe findings demonstrate the existence of con-\nsistent affective polarization across all six Euro-\npean parliaments. Although activity correlates\nwith negativity, there is no observed difference\nin affective polarization between less active\nand more active members of parliament. Fi-\nnally, we show that reciprocity is a contributing\nmechanism in affective polarization between\nparliamentarians across all six parliaments.\n1\nIntroduction\nPolitical polarization, the widening gap between\ndiffering ideological groups, impacts governance,\npublic discourse, and social unity. This division,\npowered by media echo chambers, confirmation\nbiases, and identity politics, requires empathetic\ncommunication and evidence-based discussions to\npromote a more harmonious political landscape.\nWithin political science literature, two primary\ncategories of polarization mechanisms are widely\nrecognized: ideological and affective polarization\n(Hohmann et al., 2023; Kubin and von Sikorski,\n2021; Iyengar et al., 2019).\nIdeological polarization refers to the divergence\nof ideologies and a decline in dialogue among indi-\nviduals holding different views. Affective polariza-\ntion referes to the extent to which people have affin-\nity towards their political allies (in-group members)\nand hostility towards their political opponents (out-\ngroup members) (Iyengar et al., 2012). Although\nthese two forms of polarization can reinforce each\nother, they are distinct concepts both in terms of\ntheoretical underpinnings and empirical measure-\nments (Dias and Lelkes, 2022). While measuring\nideological polarization relies on data about peo-\nple\u2019s opinions on a certain topic, assessing affective\npolarization requires information about the emo-\ntional dynamics between groups (Druckman and\nLevendusky, 2019).\nTraditional studies on affective polarization pre-\ndominantly rely on public opinion polls to mea-\nsure individuals\u2019 negative feelings towards oppos-\ning groups (Bettarelli et al., 2023; Kekkonen and\nYl\u00e4-Anttila, 2021; Hobolt et al., 2021). Contem-\nporary approaches use automatic methods such as\nsentiment analysis to study affectiveness between\nstructurally diverging groups on social platforms\n(Tyagi et al., 2020; Lerman et al., 2024). However,\npast research has typically focused on the general\npublic rather than the behaviors and rhetoric of\npublic political figures who play a crucial role in\ncreating the public discourse itself (Matsubayashi,\n2013).\nHealthy democracies thrive on the competition\nand negotiation between opposing sides inside in-\nstitutions such as parliaments. Political scientists\nemphasize that even contentious debates are prefer-\nable to the absence of dialogue, as frequent interac-\ntions between diverse viewpoints can help prevent\nthe entrenchment of extreme polarization (Harris\nand Reilly, 1998). Therefore, it is essential to study\naffective polarization among politicians within po-\nlitical elites. By doing so, we can understand the\ndynamics of political discourse and address affec-\ntive polarization before it becomes so entrenched\nthat meaningful dialogue is no longer possible.\nWith the emergence of big data collections from\nparliaments in recent years (Mollin, 2007; Erjavec\n1\narXiv:2508.18916v1  [cs.CL]  26 Aug 2025\n\net al., 2023b; European Parliament, 2024) com-\nbined with the sophistication of automatic text pro-\ncessing tools, we have the opportunity to explore\naffective polarization of politicians on a new scale.\nIn this work, we conduct a fully data-driven quan-\ntitative assessment and analysis of affective polar-\nization of members of parliaments (MPs) within\nsix national European parliaments. We employ a\nmethodology that combines an LLM-based senti-\nment model fine-tuned on parliamentary speeches\nwith named entity recognition and disambiguation\nto assess affectiveness of MPs towards one another.\nThe goal of the approach is to estimate if nega-\ntivity of speeches is higher when directed toward\nmembers of opposing groups.\nWe present three main findings. First, affective\npolarization does occur between Coalition and Op-\nposition in all six studied European parliaments.\nSecond, the more active parliamentarians exhibit\nhigher levels of negativity with no observed differ-\nence in their affective polarization. Third, we show\nthat reciprocity is a contributing mechanism in the\naffective polarization between MPs.\n2\nData\nWe analyze transcriptions of speeches from parlia-\nments of six European countries which exemplify\nall major regions of Europe: Denmark (Folketing,\nNorthern Europe), France (Assembl\u00e9e nationale,\nWestern Europe), Poland (Sejm, Central Europe),\nSerbia (Narodna Skup\u0161tina, South-Eastern Europe),\nSpain (Congreso de los Diputados, South-Western\nEurope) and Ukraine (Verkhovna Rada, Eastern Eu-\nrope). The transcriptions we use are part of the Par-\nlaMint 4.0 dataset (Erjavec et al., 2023a,b), which\nis a collection of 29 multilingual corpora consisting\nof parliamentary debates from 2015 to mid-2022\n(with several exceptions). The corpora are between\n9 and 125 million words in size and contain ex-\ntensive metadata, including information about the\nparliament, speakers, and speeches. The dataset\nalso includes marked-up transcriber comments and\nadditional information such as the speakers\u2019 year\nof birth and links to their Wikipedia pages. Lin-\nguistic annotations, such as tokenization, sentence\nsegmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and syntac-\ntic dependencies are provided, along with named\nentity annotations. Table 1 shows the general statis-\ntics of the ParlaMint data of the six selected parlia-\nments.\nFor this study, we automatically label each\nFigure 1: Sentiment distribution of the Coalition and Op-\nposition in six selected European parliaments. Asterisks\nrepresent the statistical significance in the comparison\nof the distributions using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.\nspeech with a sentiment score using the ParlaSent\nmultilingual large language model (LLM), an\nXLM-R RoBERTa model fine-tuned for sentiment\nanalysis on parliamentary speeches in five lan-\nguages (Mochtak et al., 2023). Before applying the\nmodel, we perform minimal preprocessing by ex-\ncluding the first and last sentences of each speech,\nas they are typically procedural and positive but\nlack significant content. The output of the model\nis a continuous sentiment score from 0 (most nega-\ntive) to 5 (most positive).\n3\nResults\n3.1\nSentiment Distribution\nBefore presenting the assessment of affective polar-\nization, we first show the sentiment distribution in\nparliamentary speeches delivered by both Coalition\nand Opposition MPs. Notably, there is a prevailing\nnegative sentiment inclination in all six parliaments,\nwith the median score falling below the neutral\nvalue of 2.5. Our results also show that in all six\nparliaments, the Opposition is significantly more\nnegative than the Coalition (see Figure 1). The\nlargest difference between Opposition and Coali-\ntion negativity is in the parliaments of France and\nPoland.\nAcknowledging the individuality of parliamen-\ntary customs, the diverse temporal scopes consid-\nered for each parliament, as well as the variability\nin the performance of language tools, we refrain\nfrom conducting direct cross-parliament compar-\nisons of sentiment distributions. Instead, we invite\nthe reader to observe each parliament individually,\nemphasizing the distinctions between Coalition and\nOpposition groups and their influence on affective\npolarization within each legislative body.\n2\n\nSentiment\n\nDK\nkK K ok\n\nFR\nkK K ok\n\n[1 ~Coalition\n[+1 Opposition\n\nkK K ok\n\nRS\nkK K ok\n\nES\nkK K ok\n\nUA\nkK K ok\n\nTable 1: General statistics of the analyzed data for the six selected parliaments.

To achieve this, we use the Named Entity\ntags embedded in the ParlaMint dataset to identify\nin-group and out-group entity references, with the\ninclusion of several steps of Named Entity disam-\nbiguation (see the Appendix for details). We then\ncalculate the sentiment scores of speeches directed\ntowards the same group (e.g., a Coalition MP re-\nferring to a Coalition MP) and towards the other\ngroup, respectively. We conduct separate assess-\nments for the Coalition and the Opposition.\nThe outcomes for Coalitions are depicted in Fig-\nure 2, illustrating the comparison between the C2C\nsentiment distributions (a Coalition MP referring\nto a fellow Coalition MP) and the C2O sentiment\ndistributions (a Coalition MP referring to an Oppo-\nsition MP). The results reveal that across five out\nof the six analyzed parliaments (Denmark being\nthe exception), Coalitions exhibit greater negativity\nwhen referencing their Opposition. This trend is\nespecially evident in France, Poland, and Spain,\nwhere intra-coalition discourse remains positive,\ncontrasting sharply with the negative tone when\nmentioning their Opposition. These findings pro-\nvide evidence of political divisions characterized\nby dislike, which underscores the polarized nature\nof political communication.\nSimilarly, we conduct an analogous examina-\nFigure 3: Sentiment distribution of the Opposition to-\nwards Opposition (O2O) and towards Coalition (O2C).\ntion for the Opposition, as illustrated in Figure 3,\ncomparing the O2O sentiment distributions (an Op-\nposition MP referring to an Opposition MP) and\nthe O2C sentiment distributions (an Opposition\nMP referring to Coalition MP). Despite generally\nsmaller median differences, possibly due to the\nOpposition\u2019s inherent negative stance regardless of\nthe target or topic, results show significant affective\npolarization of the Opposition for all parliaments,\nexcept France.\n3.3\nIndividual Polarization and Activity\nWe investigate whether more frequent debate par-\nticipation leads to less negativity and reduced affec-\ntively polarized behavior by analyzing the relation-\nship between the active participation of individual\nMPs and their levels of negativity and affective\npolarization.\nUp to this point, each speech has been treated\nas an independent entity, without considering the\nindividuality of MPs. To address this, we calcu-\nlate the sentiment scores for individual MPs and\ndetermine the affective polarization by subtracting\nthe sentiment when an MP references the opposing\ngroup from the sentiment when referencing their\nown group.\nResults reveal a weak negative correlation be-\ntween activity levels of MPs and their sentiment\nacross five out of six parliaments (Spain being the\nexception), with Spearman\u2019s rank correlation val-\nues ranging from -0.21 in Serbia to -0.42 in Den-\n3\n\nSentiment\n\nDK\n\nFR\nK ok 3K\n\nK ok 3K\n\n; | C2C\n(| C20\n\nRS\nK ok 3K\n\nES\nK ok 3K\n\nUA\nK ok 3K\n\n\nSentiment\n\n\u2014\n\nDK\noK 2 OK\n\nFR\n\nPL\noK 2 OK\n\n[} O20\ni 02C\n\noK 2 OK\n\noK 2 OK\n\nUA\noK 2 OK\n\nmark. This indicates that MPs who deliver more\nspeeches tend to express more negative sentiments.\nOn the other hand, we observe no correlation be-\ntween activity levels of MPs and their affective po-\nlarization. These results suggest that, although the\nless active MPs exhibit lower negativity, they ex-\npress similar levels of emotional division between\nCoalition and Opposition (shown in Figure 4).\nFigure 4: Correlations between activity levels, senti-\nment, and affective polarization. More active MPs are\ntypically more negative except for Spain where there is\nno significance.\n3.4\nAffective Reciprocity\nLastly, we investigate whether reciprocity is present\nin the affective behavior of MPs towards each other,\nwhich could help explain overall affective polariza-\ntion. To assess reciprocity, we compute the Spear-\nman\u2019s rank correlation between the sentiment ex-\npressed by one MP when referring to another and\nthe sentiment expressed returned by the second MP,\nacross all MP pairs.\nResults (shown in Table 2) suggest that weak to\nmoderate positive reciprocity is present in all six\nparliaments, with French parliamentarians show-\ning the highest reciprocity, and Danish the lowest.\nThe presence of reciprocity alone does not inher-\nently imply a positive or negative impact on democ-\nracy, as it heavily depends upon contextual factors.\nTable 2: Sentiment reciprocity in the selected parlia-\nments.

Re-\nsults reveal heightened negativity towards opposing\ngroups in all six studied European parliaments, in-\ndicating the persistence of affective polarization.\nAdditionally, we found that more active parliamen-\ntarians tend to be more negative overall; however,\nthe levels of affective polarization do not correlate\nwith parliamentary activity. We also observed that\nsentiment reciprocity is present in all six parlia-\nments, potentially serving as a crucial mechanism\nfor establishing affective polarization among par-\nliamentarians.\nOur approach involves a notable simplification:\nusing the sentiment expressed in speeches when\nmentioning a person as a proxy for the sentiment\ndirected towards that person. Depending on the cus-\ntoms and language norms in each parliament, this\nmay not always be accurate. Despite this limitation,\nthe consistency of our results, which significantly\nexceeds mere noise, suggests the reliability of our\nmethod.\nThis work highlights the usefulness of fully\nautomated methods in analyzing complex social\nconstructs like affective polarization. By leverag-\ning NLP techniques on large-scale parliamentary\ndatasets, we contribute to a deeper understanding\nof political communication dynamics and the mech-\nanisms underlying affective polarization within po-\nlitical elites. Monitoring democracies through such\nindicators can provide an early warning mechanism\nfor detecting signs of democratic erosion, helping\nto maintain democratic resilience.\n4\n\nSentiment\n\nAffective Polarization\n\nSentiment\n\nAffective Polarization\n\nOO\n\nNO\n\nDenmark\nSpearman: -0.42 (***)\n\n0 1000 2000\n\nActivity\n\nSerbia\n\n0 500 1000\nActivity\n\nFrance\n3 | Spearman: -0.37 (***)\n\u00ae\n\nNO\n\nSentiment\n\nCc\niS)\nie\n.N\n\u00a9\nO\noO\nO\n2\n8\n=\n<x\n@\n0 1000\nActivity\nSpain\n4\n\u20ac 3\n\u00a9\nE\nc2\nOF\n\u201d)\n1\n0\n4\n\nAffective Polarization\n\n0 100\nActivity\n\nPoland\nSpearman: -0.27,(***)\ne\n\nSentiment\n\nCc\nOo\n\u00a9\nIN\nfo\nOo\nal\n\u00ae\n2\n3\nYo\n<\n0) 500\nActivity\nUkraine\n\nSpearman: -0.34 (***)\n\nSentiment\n\nCc\niS)\nie\n.N\n\u00a9\nO\noO\nO\n2\n8\n=\n<x\n0 500\nActivity\n\nCode available at:\ngithub.com/boevkoski/affective_polarization\nReferences\nLuca Bettarelli, Andres Reiljan, and Emilie Van Haute.\n2023.

However, the latter is often difficult\nas many researchers lack the colleagues, resources, or capacity\nto conduct research that is generalisable or rigorous enough to\nadvance the discipline. As a result, research methods that enable\nsense-making with larger volumes of qualitative data, while not\nincreasing the burden on the researcher, have significant potential\nwithin CER.\nIn this discussion paper, we propose such a method for conduct-\ning rigorous analysis on large volumes of textual data, namely a\nvariation of LLM-assisted content analysis (LACA). This method\ncombines content analysis with the use of large language models,\nempowering researchers to conduct larger-scale research which\nthey would otherwise not be able to perform. Using a computing\neducation dataset, we illustrate how LACA could be applied in a\nreproducible and rigorous manner. We believe this method has po-\ntential in CER, enabling more generalisable findings from a wider\nrange of research. This, together with the development of similar\nmethods, can help to advance both the practice and research quality\nof the CER discipline.\nCCS CONCEPTS\n\u2022 Social and professional topics \u2192Computing education;\n\u2022 General and reference \u2192Empirical studies; Measurement; \u2022\nComputing methodologies \u2192Artificial intelligence.\nKEYWORDS\nContent analysis, large language models, qualitative data, comput-\ning education research methodology\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nShe closed her laptop and took a deep breath. She was\ncertain the new approach to teaching CS1 had improved\nthe course, but how could she convince the university?\nIt would mean asking for more resources, and that re-\nquired more than just conviction. Hard numbers would\nhave helped, but the grade data was still weeks away.\nAll she had now was the tangle of student comments\nfrom the course evaluations\u2014subjective, scattered, and\nstubbornly resistant to quick conclusions, something\nwhich she did not have time for.\nComputing education (CE) and its associated research (CER) is a\nfast-growing independent discipline. Over the last few decades, we\nhave strived to achieve better teaching, enabling more individuals\nto succeed in and outside of computing through computational\nmeans, as evident from the significant role which teaching, learning,\ncourse design, and student experiences play in our research [2, 34].\nHowever, CER remains a young field which, in many ways, is still\nmaturing. A large corpus of CER studies remain to be experience\nreports, also spoken of as Genesis or Marco Polo papers \u2014 \u201cAnd he\nsaw what he had made, and it was good\u201d, respectively, \u201cI went there\nand I saw this\u201d [34].\nAs our fictitious introductory story tells, proper analysis of teach-\ning interventions, and other data collected in CER, is often a luxury.\nSmall teams, a lack of research connections, or a primary allocation\nto teaching activities often make rigorous analysis unfeasible. How-\never, through proper, rigorous analyses of the many data points\nwe often aggregate in our research \u2014 such as student feedback,\nvideo recordings, or log data \u2014 we can improve not only our under-\nstanding of their effects in the classroom, but also our report to the\nresearch community. This is more important now than ever; with an\nincreasing number of students being exposed to computing, there\nis a need for repeatable and generalisable research which allows us\nto scale and improve computing education across education levels\nand institutions.\nWith the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in qual-\nitative research across domains, we stand with a new opportunity\nas computing education teachers and researchers. More in-depth\nanalyses can now be conducted with fewer resources, so long as\nLLMs are used carefully and intentionally. This discussion paper\nproposes LLM-assisted content analysis (LACA), which harnesses\nthe power of LLMs within the broader method of content analysis.\nSpecifically, LLMs are used for performing deductive coding, with\nthe researcher responsible for deductively or inductively generating\nthe codebook. To show a potential application of LACA, we provide\nan example case study with a computing education dataset. The\nuse of LACA empowers researchers to analyse large sets of textual\ndata that they would not otherwise be feasible. This particularly\nbenefits computing educators lacking the ability to rigorously in-\nvestigate the effect of their intervention and researchers analysing\nlarge bodies of student or teacher text with content analysis.\nWe believe this to be particularly important now, as existing\noverarching methods for LLM use in qualitative methods are lack-\ning, making it easy and tempting for researchers to not disclose\ntheir usage. Thus, if we want to conduct trustworthy, repeatable,\nand ethical research with LLMs, adherence to rigorous research\nmethods is vital. LACA is a step towards this.\narXiv:2508.18872v1  [cs.CL]  26 Aug 2025\n\n2\nCONTENT ANALYSIS\nContent analysis (CA) is a method for analysing textual data that\nhas developed over many decades. It has since expanded into a\nlarge umbrella of methods which have been frequently used to\nanalyse a range of textual and non-textual data. Within CER, CA\nhas been applied to a wide range of rich data types, addressing\na vast portfolio of different research questions ( e.g., [10, 21, 32]).\nBefore explaining how LLMs can be used in CA, we first define\nwhat CA is and justify why LLMs are appropriate to use.\n2.1\nDefinitions and Key Principles\nWe use Krippendorff [14] and Neuendorf [22] as well-respected CA\nguides for situating and developing LACA. They define content\nanalysis as the following1:\nContent analysis is a research technique for making replicable and\nvalid inferences from texts (or other meaningful matter) to the\ncontexts of their use. - Krippendorff [14, p. 18]\nContent analysis is a summarizing, quantitative analysis of mes-\nsages that follows the standards of the scientific method (in-\ncluding attention to objectivity\u2013intersubjectivity, a priori design, reli-\nability, validity, generalizability, replicability, and hypothesis testing\nbased on theory) and is not limited as to the types of variables that\nmay be measured or the context in which the messages are created or\npresented. - Neuendorf [22, p. 22]\nBased on these, there are some key principles of CA, which are\ndescribed in more detail in Neuendorf\u2019s six-part definition of CA.\nFirst, content analysis is concerned with analysing messages.\nThese messages do not have to be textual but must contain some\n\u201cmeaning\u201d [14, 22], allowing a wide range of media to be analysed.\nWithin CER, this has enabled CA to be performed on a wealth of\ntextual and non-textual data, such as interview transcripts [10, 28],\nvideo recordings of students [21], and programming data [12, 32,\n35].\nSecond, content analysis was originally developed as a quantita-\ntive method for summarising data. The typical output of content\nanalyses is a codebook containing counts for different categories.\nThese can facilitate further statistical analysis, comparison with\nrelated work, or greater understanding of a phenomenon. Qualita-\ntive versions of content analysis methods are now widely accepted\nand used (.e.g, [18]), which differ in how the codebook is produced.\nThis is common in CER (e.g., [10, 21, 32]), perhaps due to the lack\nof preexisting CER to base codebooks on.\nFor codebooks derived using CA to be considered useful, content\nanalyses must be conducted with sufficient rigour and reproducibil-\nity. This brings us to arguably the most important principle of CA: it\nabides by the principles of the scientific method. This involves\nusing hypothesis testing and prior theory where appropriate, so\nas to build on previous work, and ensuring suitable validity and\nreliability, such as reaching acceptable interrater reliability values.\nAll of this should be sufficiently detailed to allow others to replicate,\nwhich is often lacking in CER and beyond.\n1Emphasis by the authors of this paper.\n2.2\nThe Limitations of Content Analysis\nBased on these principles, a key goal of CA is to generalise findings\nto a wider population than the sample in question [22]. This requires\nappropriate sampling as well as sufficient validity and reliability.\nOver time, repeatedly conducting larger-scale and more general-\nisable content analyses brings about quicker and more significant\nadvances in the research field, improving our understanding and\nbenefitting practice.\nUnfortunately, conducting generalisable CA is often difficult in\nCER. First, computing education researchers often lack the per-\nsonnel to conduct sufficiently large content analyses \u2014 here the\nnumber of coders, rather than the amount of data, is typically a\nfactor limiting the volume of data that can be coded. Second, re-\nsearchers may lack the time to conduct sufficiently rigorous CA,\nespecially if they are analysing other data in the same study. Even\nif there were sufficient time and resources, coordinating large-scale\ncontent analyses adds an organisational burden and becomes harder\nto ensure reliability.\n2.3\nWhy LLMs Can Help\nWe believe the use of LLMs in CA can enable researchers and\neducators to perform analysis that they would not otherwise be\nable to perform. Just as importantly, we believe that LLMs can be\nused in a methodologically sound manner that conforms to the\nprinciples of CA for several reasons.\nFirst, the principles of the scientific method, particularly reliabil-\nity, validity, and replicability, can be adhered to when using LLMs\nin CA. During the process of deductive coding, LLMs can effectively\nreplace the role of human coders, making measures of reliability\nand validity verifiable in the same way. Interrater reliability (IRR)\nmeasures, for example, function the same regardless of how the\ncodes for a set of data were generated. To facilitate replicability,\ndetails of the LLM can be reported, such as the model, prompt, and\ndates of experiments [30, 36].\nAdditionally, the task of deductive coding in content analysis\nsuits the capabilities of LLMs. Codebooks should contain instruc-\ntions, examples, definitions, and anything else that allows human\ncoders to reliably code the same data [22]. These elements of a\nclearly defined codebook also enable LLMs to reliably code data,\nespecially when combined with appropriate prompt engineering\ntechniques [16, 19]. There is already some evidence to suggest that\nLLMs can perform such deductive coding with good interrater relia-\nbility [6, 15, 19] and do not perform well on categories that humans\nstruggle to reliably code [15, 16]. A consequence of this is arguably\npositive; LLMs will not code as reliably if the codebook provided\nis not sufficiently detailed, which encourages researchers to use\nclearly defined codebooks.\nNot only can LLMs follow clear human instructions, the sum-\nmarising nature of CA is well suited to LLMs. While some inter-\npretation may be required, CA is \u2018less in-depth and detailed\u2019 in the\ninterest of reliability and generalisability [22]. Performing coding\nwhere LLMs are required to perform interpretation or have more\ncontextual knowledge can yield unreliable results [16], which can\nalso be the case with humans [22]. This is not useful when trying\nto assess counts or perform other statistical analyses.\n2\n\n2.4\nHow LLMs Can Help\nBased on the considerations in the previous sections, we believe\nLLMs best serve as deductive coding agents in CA. This application\nof LLMs serves several benefits, particularly for researchers lacking\ntime, colleagues, or resources.\nOne obvious advantage of using LLMs is scale. In traditional CA,\nthe number of researchers limits the sample of texts that can be\nanalysed [14]. As long as the principles of CA are followed, it can\nbe applied to very large datasets; one example in Neuendorf [22]\nincludes a CA of 31 million words involving 31 coauthors/coders.\nProvided with a suitable codebook, LLMs can perform vast amounts\nof coding, hugely expanding the amount a single or small group\nof researchers can analyse. No longer is the number of researchers\nthe limit for the amount of data CA can be performed on.\nAn associated benefit is speed. Even if one did have a group of 31\ntrained coders, the analysis would take time to perform. This is not\nideal for quick scoping analyses or researchers pressured by time,\nperhaps due to teaching commitments. LLMs, on the other hand,\ncan perform deductive coding much quicker than humans. Where\njustification is required to resolve disagreements and improve relia-\nbility, chain-of-thought reasoning can also help to identify coding\npatterns in the LLM [1].\n3\nLLM-ASSISTED CONTENT ANALYSIS\nWe now propose LLM-assisted content analysis (LACA), an instance\nof content analysis that incorporates LLMs for the purposes of\ndeductive coding. This builds on an existing method of the same\nname [6], with extensions related to methodological and ethical\nrigour. Unlike other aspects of qualitative and content analyses,\nwe believe the use of LLMs is methodologically compatible with\nand technically proficient at the deductive aspect of content anal-\nysis. Conversely, we do not believe LLMs can effectively perform\nmore interpretive forms of qualitative analysis or inductive code\ngeneration.\nFigure 1 visualises the LACA process. In this section, we outline\nthe process and exemplify the individual steps using a fictitious\nworked example. While the example is not complete, we provide\nall the necessary documentation for conducting it in an online\nrepository [23].\nWith LACA, we highly emphasise how the steps prior to the\nuse of an LLM are crucial in ensuring proper, ethical application.\nIn particular, researchers should consider whether applying LACA\nis a suitable approach to use, and inform potential participants\nand ethical committees. Generally, we recommend local models,\nin accordance with ethical recommendations [30], especially if the\napplication of LACA is decided post data collection.\nThe example we demonstrate LACA on is a continuation of Si-\nmon and Sheard\u2019s research, who sought to analyse two decades\nof papers at the Innovation and Technology in Computer Science\nEducation (ITiCSE) conference. The data set includes abstracts from\npublications from SIGCSE TS (7936), ITiCSE (3154), ICER (730),\nTOCE (334), Koli Calling (316), GCE (103). The data set was ag-\ngregated using Semantic scholar.2 The full data set is accessible\nthrough the link to our example [23].\n2https://www.semanticscholar.org\nDecision point\nRepeat until agreement\nRepeat until agreement or fatigue\nDetermine collection strategy and consent\nJustify the use of LLMs as a methodological approach.

Many of these studies have used\nCA to conduct their analysis, which will naturally become harder\nas the CER discipline grows. We therefore use this example due to\nthe number of publications outweighing the capability of human\ncoding involved and the dataset being easily acquirable. From here\non, text related to this example will appear in italics.\nStep 1 First, one should consider whether LACA is an appropri-\nate choice of method for the research to be conducted. This includes\nconsidering the complexity of the data aggregated and whether\nalternative types of analysis may perform better. One should also\nconsider the model of choice; local models increase privacy while\nremote models may collect data and be more expensive. However,\nlarge local LLMs may take significant time to complete generating\nresponses, depending on the machine available.\nIn the case of our example, we are analysing abstracts, looking for\ncertain themes emerging. Here, we first consider whether a simple\nanalysis based on word occurrence will suffice. However, after manual\nexploration of some of the data, we found that different abstracts\nutilise a wide array of words to describe different concepts, which\nwe cannot guarantee to catch by simply utilising word lists. We also\nrealise that the complexity of abstracts can be significant, and thus opt\nfor one of the larger local LLMs. In this case, we use gemma 3 27B as\nthis can be run on a mid-range MacBook Pro M3. We do not consider\nany anonymisation procedures as the data under investigation will\n3\n\ncontain no sensitive data.\nStep 2 Then, one should construct the codebook. It is important\nto state that the LACA process does not provide any particular\nmeans to do this. Instead, researchers should opt for a method of\ncodebook generation which is appropriate for the research. Sec-\nond, one should consider a representative sample to execute the\npreliminary human review of and decide on an appropriate IRR\nmeasure to use, such as Cohen\u2019s \ud835\udf05[20], Krippendorff\u2019s \ud835\udefc[13]. Two\nor more reviewers should then conduct the content analysis based\non the designed codebook, and iteratively improve the codebook\nto achieve an acceptable level of inter-rater reliability.\nGiven that we are extending the work by Simon & Sheard [34], we\nopt to design the codebook for this example by reusing their descrip-\ntion of themes, and including the themes which they identify in the\nstudy, as most prominent [23]. For the sake of illustration, the themes\ninclude, but are not limited to; \u201cTeaching/learning techniques\u201d, \u201cTeach-\ning/learning tools\u201d, \u201cRecruitment, progression, pathways\u201d, and \u201cGen-\nder issues\u201d. Using this, two reviewers would code a random sample of\n1,257 abstracts (10%) to determine the quality of the codebook. Dis-\ncussing disagreements, we would revise the codebook and continue\nuntil inter-rater reliability was high enough to constitute agreement.\nFor this, we decide on utilising a variation of Krippendorff\u2019s \ud835\udefcwhich\nallows each reviewer to assign multiple codes to a single data point,\nand strive for an \ud835\udefc-value above 0.80, as recommended by Krippendorff\n[14]\nStep 3 Based on your findings from step 2 , you should con-\nsider whether LACA is still appropriate. It can, therefore, be appro-\npriate to include additional information during the human coding.\nThis could include comparative indicators such as how weak or\nstrong individual codings are compared to others, to help assert the\nappropriateness of the method, as described in Section 2.4.\nGiven the fictitious nature of our example, we assume a Krippendorff\u2019s\n\ud835\udefchigher than our threshold of 0.80 was achieved through dialogue\nabout disagreements and iterations on the codebook. Given the direct-\nness of the themes and the high IRR, we assume continuing with a\nlarge context local LLM is feasible.\nStep 4 The next step is employing an LLM to conduct the analysis\non the same sample as the human coders, and then, calculate the\nIRR between human and LLM. The prompt from which we start is\nsimply the codebook used in the previous stages. If the IRR achieved\ninitially is not above the selected threshold, one should refine the\ncodebook (now prompt) by inspecting the resulting analysis. It\nis here important to recognise that, despite laudable efforts and\nmany iterative cycles, the LLM may never reach IRR which is above\nthe pre-defined acceptable threshold. We refer to this as fatigue.\nThus, it is important to monitor whether the IRR stagnates despite\nchanges to the prompt. In these cases, one should reconsider not\nmoving forward with LACA.\nIf one does continue, there are many ways to design an analysis\n\u2018flow\u2019 that illustrates the LACA process in a transparent and repeat-\nable manner. For this purpose, we developed a small library [24]\nand no-code solution [25] which allows users to conduct LACA\nprogrammatically. In particular, the library is designed to record\nthe flow of analysis, so as to increase transparency of what trans-\nformations the data goes through.\nTo conduct the LLM analysis on the sample coded by humans, we de-\nsign a workflow in our visual tool [25], which automatically produces\na shareable codebook and allows us to compare the human-coded\ndata, saved as a JSON file, with that generated by the LLM, saved\nas a CSV file. We make some minor changes to the codebook (see\n[23]), so that we can more easily execute the modified Krippendorff\u2019s\nalpha previously mentioned (also implemented by the tool). Figure 2\nillustrates the specific flow. First, the abstracts 1 and human codes\n2 are imported. Then, we apply the LLM prompt on each abstract 3\nand modify the output to make it comparable to the human codes 4 .\nWe then compare the human codes to the LLM codes using the chosen\nIRR measure 5 , and save both the LLM generated codes 6 and the\nIRR value 7 . We then simply run the flow, modify the prompt as\nneeded depending on the IRR produced, and continue until acceptable\nIRR is achieved on the sample.\nStep 5 Based on whether the LLM is capable of reaching accept-\nable IRR with the human codings, decide on the next action. If\nthe IRR is acceptable, you move on to step 6 . If not, reevaluate\nwhether LACA is appropriate, potentially returning to step 2 to\nrevisit your codebook (not prompt), design, and choice of LLM.\nBased on our fictitious example, we assume that after a series of itera-\ntions, the prompt achieves acceptable IRR, and we therefore continue\nto step 6 .\nStep 6 Now, utilise the LLM to code the entire dataset. The anal-\nysis flow should be equivalent to the analysis in Step 5 and be\nreflected in any reporting of LACA.\nIn the case of our example, the analysis flow, generated from our tool,\nis run on the entire data set, excluding the comparison component (see\n[23]).\nStep 7\nIn line with existing guidelines on reporting LLM use\nin qualitative research [30] and research generally [36], it is cru-\ncial to report details regarding the LLM used and the particular\nchoices made within the LACA process. There are many things\none could report. We recommend that one reports; 1) that an LLM\nwas used to perform content analysis; 2) the choice of model and\nversion (i.e., open-source or proprietary model, local or remote);\n3) data anonymisation procedures; 4) Sampling sizes; 5) IRR mea-\nsure used and final values for both human-human and human-LLM\ncomparisons; and 6) the codebook and analysis flow used.\nSome of this information need not documenting in the main\nbody of the paper. More intricate details for precise replication\nof the study can be included as an appendix or in an open study\nrepository.\n4\n\nFigure 2: Illustration of LLM workflow in our custom no-code tool for doing programmatic analysis with local LLMs.\nBased on the analysis conducted as part of our example, one could\nreport all of the above in a similar way to the following (but including\nIRR values explictly):\nWe applied LLM-Assisted Content Analysis. First, designing a code-\nbook using sections of Simon and Sheard [34] (see Appendix A), and\nrefining this based on the IRR (A modified version of Krippendorff\u2019s\n\ud835\udefcto support multiple codes from each reviewer) achieved by two re-\nviewers coding a random sample of 1,257 publications (10%). We then\nutilised a local Gemma 27B model to analyse each abstract in the\nsample, comparing it to the human codes using the same IRR method\nas before, and achieved a high \ud835\udefc-value, implying agreement between\nhumans and the LLM (\ud835\udefc> 0.80). Then, we conducted the LLM-based\nanalysis on the entire dataset (12,573 publication abstracts), which\nlays the foundation of our findings. The flow of analysis is visualised\nin Figure 1. For the codebook and LLM analysis flow, see Appendix B.\n4\nEXISTING QUALITATIVE APPROACHES\nWITH LLMS\nThe applications of LLMs to qualitative research has unsurprisingly\nbeen widely investigated in the last few years. However, much\nof the work resides outside of computing education research. The\nresearch which does exist in computing education employs complex\nanalysis such as combining multiple existing methods, including\nusing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to extract rationales\nin publications [31]. While Schulte et al. [31] also contribute a\ncustom library to conduct similar analysis to theirs, they do not\nexplicitly incorporate IRR in their method, explicitly consider the\nethical considerations outlined by Schroeder et al. [30], or provide\ninstructional guidelines to recreate their method.3\nThus, we here provide a brief overview of some general areas of\napplication, as well as some ethical and methodological objections.\nWe do not provide a comprehensive report given the large traction\nLLM use has gained in qualitative research. Further, we do not\nreport on \u2018traditional\u2019 NLP approaches, e.g., fine-tuning of BERT\n3While instructional guidelines are not expected, it underlines the need for method-\noriented publications.\nmodels, as the purpose of this research is to make NLP approaches\nmore accessible for researchers.\nSeveral works have tried to integrate LLMs into existing quali-\ntative methods to develop new methodological contributions. An\nexample of this is LATA, or LLM-assisted thematic analysis [37],\nwhich aims to incorporate LLMs into the process of thematic anal-\nysis as defined by Braun and Clarke [4]. LLMs are involved in\ninductively generating open codes, searching for themes, and cod-\ning using the final set of themes. The use of LLMs application to\nTA has similarly been applied by De Paoli and Mathis [7], who look\nto assess valid uses of LLMs. However, the process of inductive\ntheme generation by LLMs is arguably methodologically opposed\nto the principles of reflexive thematic analysis. Researchers\u2019 expe-\nriences, background, and interpretations are key aspects of a TA\nprocedure [5], which LLMs do not possess. Performing interrater\nreliability measures, as these articles do, is also opposed to reflexive\nTA [5]. More generally, we are methodologically opposed to the use\nof LLMs for any inductive code generation that does not involve\nhumans. Inductive code generation requires good understanding of\nthe research questions and immersion in the data. These research\nquestions will evolve based on the analysis, requiring coders to be\nadaptable and reflexive. We believe such creativity in analysis is\nunique to humans.\nMore work investigates the ability of LLMs to deductively code\ndata. That is, where LLMs are provided with a codebook rather\nthan prompted to generate one. In this case, if the codes are reli-\nable enough, LLMs can simply replace the role of a trained coder\nwho has not conducted any of the prior research. Initial research\nshows promise in terms of speed and accuracy. McClure et al. [19]\nfound that LLMs achieved a higher accuracy than humans when\ndeductively coding open-text responses. Other studies have found\nthat, for some codes, LLMs\u2019 \u2018performance\u2019 is similar to humans\n[6, 15, 19]. However, \u2018performance\u2019 is often measured with a confu-\nsion matrix rather than IRR values, which is more of a \u2018traditional\u2019\nNLP approach to evaluation.\n5\n\n5) Import abstracts\n\n4 simplifiedcodedsample json\n\n\u00a9 a Make list of LLM generated codes \u2018Bi\n\nEP)\n\n&)] Import human codings\n\n# simplifiedcodedsample.json 7\n\nS@ J Compare codings x\n\n\\S G Save alpha\n\noutput\n\n\u2014 5 (6 Save LLM codings\n\n& Ilm-simon-analysis\n\n\u00bb /Users/sebni/Documents/Repositories/discussion-paper-analysis/outputs\n\n\u00bb /Users/sebni/Documents/Repositories/discussion-paper-analysis/outputs\n\n5\nAPPLICATIONS, LIMITATIONS, AND\nREFLECTIONS\nWe argue that CER is a fruitful discipline for conducting LACA. Not\nonly is content analysis frequently used within CER, many mem-\nbers of the CER community are intertwining their teaching with\ntheir research, or lack the resources to perform medium-large scale\nanalysis of textual data often collected from participants. LACA\nprovides a method for analysing such data, even when researchers\ndo not have the capacity to manually inspect it all themselves.\nThe sort of data that arises from these experiences varies widely,\nproviding many good applications of LACA within CER. For ex-\nample, educators of large undergraduate courses may have a large\nnumber of students\u2019 written feedback from which they wish to\nidentify students\u2019 struggles or conceptions (e.g., [9, 11, 27]). LACA\ncould be performed to speed up the coding of this process, as well as\nenable aggregation of data over multiple institutions. Alternatively,\nCER researchers may, for example, wish to categorise students\u2019\nprogramming data to understand common patterns in program-\nming behaviour (e.g., [12, 32, 35]). Applying LACA again increases\nthe number of logs which could be analysed [15], complementing\nquantitative data obtained. As another example, tool developers\nmay wish to analyse masses of textual student data inputted into\ntheir tool to, for example, summarise common misconceptions or\ndemonstrate the efficacy of their tool.\nThe purpose of these examples is not to provide an exhaustive\nlist of applications, but rather a starting point to motivate the range\nof CER that LACA enables. In doing this, however, we also acknowl-\nedge a limitation of LACA: the range of data used in CER is much\nmore varied than the textual data that is appropriate for LACA. CER\nresearchers have also analysed visual data [3], video recordings\nof students [21], and even physical data from students [8]. Future\nwork involves expanding the application of LACA beyond textual\ndata to enable a wider range of large-scale analysis.\nAnother limitation of the current version of LACA is the lack of\nclarity around when to stop. While we acknowledge the possibility\nfatigue, we do not know how to reliably verify whether this has\nhappened. In other words, if a researcher(s) has already repeated\nstep 4 five times, should they do it again? We believe certain\nheuristics in future applications of LACA will help to determine\nthis. Either way, continuous iteration and trial-and-error situations\nmay inadvertently make LACA more time-consuming than general\ncontent analysis (depending on the data, codebook, and utilised\nmodel).\nThe final limitation we note is the uncertainty of what data LACA\nperforms well on. While our example in Section 3 includes relatively\nshort-form data which is easy to code, it is not entirely clear what\nsort of data favours the use of LLM coding. Related work indicates\nthat LLMs can code more concrete concepts [15, 19]. However, the\nlack of clarity around suitable data clouds the judgment required\nfor step 1 and step 3 . Based on our current experiments and\nexisting research, we suspect LLMs will perform better on short- to\nmedium-form textual data. The longer the text, the more complex\ncoding becomes, the more interpretation generally required, and\nthe more margin for error. Accurate coding is likely to decrease as\nthe length and importance of context increase.\nAs a consequence of our limitations, a core strand of our further\nwork is the use of LACA in many situations where we envision it\nto be of benefit. As CER researchers, we wish to start with applica-\ntions within our rich field. As well as enabling previously unfeasible\nresearch, each deployment of the LACA method serves as an op-\nportunity to learn more about what sort of textual data it can be\nperformed on. interactive rebase in progress; onto b6e3dafThis\nincludes details about the type of data, the complexity of the code-\nbook, and the amount of contextual knowledge required to perform\ncoding. As we advocate the use of LLMs, results from these studies\ncan also be compared with more traditional natural language pro-\ncessing techniques such as sentiment analysis. These areas of future\nwork will inform both the technical and methodological aspects of\nLACA\n6\nCONCLUSION\nComputing education research (CER) is a healthy community con-\nsisting of researchers from a wide range of disciplines, backgrounds,\nand experiences. However, it is still a young field, with the rigour\nand generalisability of findings within the field often limited by the\nnumber or capacity of people to analyse data. In this discussion\npaper, we have proposed a methodological solution to this problem\nwithin the context of textual data through LLM-assisted content\nanalysis (LACA). Not only does LACA enable researchers to con-\nduct larger-scale analysis quicker, it also encourages this to be done\nin a repeatable and rigorous manner. We hope this paper can be\nused to encourage the responsible and reliable use of LACA, and\nLLMs more generally, within the CER community.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nInclude acknowledgements if you wish\nREFERENCES\n[1] Julian Ashwin, Aditya Chhabra, World Bank, and Vijayendra Rao. 2023.

This paper presents Reflective-\nPrompt1 \u2014 a novel autoprompting method based on evolutionary algorithms that employs a reflective\nevolution approach for more precise and comprehensive search of optimal prompts. ReflectivePrompt\nutilizes short-term and long-term reflection operations before crossover and elitist mutation to en-\nhance the quality of the modifications they introduce. This method allows for the accumulation of\nknowledge obtained throughout the evolution process and updates it at each epoch based on the\ncurrent population. ReflectivePrompt was tested on 33 datasets for classification and text generation\ntasks using open-access large language models: t-lite-instruct-0.1 and gemma3-27b-it. The method\ndemonstrates, on average, a significant improvement (e.g., 28% on BBH compared to EvoPrompt) in\nmetrics relative to current state-of-the-art approaches, thereby establishing itself as one of the most\neffective solutions in evolutionary algorithm-based autoprompting.\nKeywords AutoPrompting \u00b7 LLM \u00b7 NLP \u00b7 Reflective Evolution \u00b7 prompt\n1\nIntroduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant results in solving Natural Language Processing (NLP)\ntasks [34, 11]. Prompting and prompt engineering are universal methods for improving the performance of LLMs\nthat do not require access to model weights and gradients during training. Instead, they enhance the efficiency of\nLLM inference by providing carefully crafted and well-structured instructions (prompts) as input to the model [18].\nCurrently, there are many different prompting techniques, such as Few-Shot [2], Role-Based [33], Chain-of-Thought\n[35], Plan-and-Solve [32], and others. What all these techniques have in common is that they can be time-consuming to\nmanually create, iterate, and optimize, often requiring expert knowledge and experience. The reason for this is that\nmodels are highly sensitive to input data, necessitating careful and precise application of these techniques [14].\nAutoprompting addresses this issue by automating the generation and selection of prompts [28]. It is based on\nvarious optimization methods and principles, including reinforcement learning, evolutionary, gradient-based, and\ngradient-free approaches, among others [28, 13, 8, 22]. In particular, prompt optimization can be either discrete or\ncontinuous [26]. Continuous optimization involves representing the prompt as a numerical tensor, while discrete\noptimization treats the prompt as a sequence of tokens. The latter approach offers several advantages: it does not require\nderivative computations, meaning there is no need to access the model\u2019s internal parameters and gradients. This allows\nworking with black-box models and avoids additional computational overhead [19]. Additionally, it preserves prompt\n1Code available as a part of CoolPrompt framework library: https://github.com/CTLab-ITMO/CoolPrompt/\narXiv:2508.18870v1  [cs.CL]  26 Aug 2025\n\nReflectivePrompt: Reflective evolution in autoprompting algorithms\ninterpretability, enabling humans to analyze and edit them [19], and allows optimization for any metric (including\nnon-differentiable ones) [8, 15, 21, 6].\nHowever, this approach also has challenges: the optimization space for prompts is vast, and prompts generated through\nsearch methods may lack diversity [8]. Nevertheless, there are numerous heuristic optimization algorithms that employ\nstochastic strategies, making the optimization process less sensitive to local optima. Evolutionary algorithms are one\nsuch example [4].\nIn this work, we analyzed the Reflective Evolution algorithm [36] and integrated it to address the problem of automatic\nprompt generation. The resulting solution, called ReflectivePrompt, was tested on 33 datasets to demonstrate its\neffectiveness compared to existing methods.\n1.1\nEvolutionary algorithms\nEvolutionary algorithms are a family of optimization methods based on the principles of biological evolution: natural\nselection, mutation, crossover, and inheritance. These algorithms operate with populations of solutions, gradually\nimproving them according to a given fitness function [18]. Among such algorithms, the genetic algorithm [9] can be\ndistinguished, which works with gene sequences (in our case, sequences of phrases in prompts). Within this algorithm,\nstarting with an initial population of individuals, selection, crossover of selected individuals (creating offspring based on\na combination of parental information), mutation of the offspring (random modification of certain parts), and population\nupdate based on offspring evaluations are performed iteratively.\nThis approach is highly flexible when applied to problems from various domains. The usage of evolutionary operators\n(crossover, mutation) and population-based search reduces the risk of getting stuck in local optima, maintaining a\nbalance between exploring new solutions and exploiting existing ones, thereby leading to a high diversity of individuals\nin the final population while ensuring their quality according to the objective function remains high [8, 15, 21, 6].\n1.2\nRelated works\nOne solution employing genetic algorithms is EvoPrompt [8]. The improvement of the candidate prompt population\noccurs iteratively through selection, evolution (generation of new candidates using evolutionary operators), and\npopulation updates based on the evaluation of new candidates. The implementation of evolutionary operators (mutation\nand crossover) is achieved through queries to an LLM, enabling the utilization of its expertise in solving NLP tasks\nwhile maintaining prompt readability. During new candidate generation, two parents are first selected from the previous\npopulation using roulette-wheel selection (selection phase) [16], followed by the application of crossover and subsequent\nmutation of the resulting offspring. The study also presents a differential evolution algorithm [23], which involves\nmutating different segments of two donor prompts from the same population, combining them with a mutating candidate,\nand performing crossover with the current best prompt. The authors\u2019 position EvoPrompt as a general framework for\nintegrating LLMs into evolutionary algorithms, with experimental results demonstrating that differential evolution\nexhibits superior performance on more complex tasks.\nSPELL [15] employs a genetic algorithm operating iteratively through repeated reproduction and selection steps, where\nselection is performed via roulette-wheel while reproduction involves generating offspring based on a list of parent\nprompts and their corresponding scores. Notably, although reproduction is also conducted through LLM queries, this\nsolution lacks explicit separation between crossover and mutation. Instead, it utilizes a predefined prompt instructing\nmodifications to the parent prompt set (replacing, adding, or deleting words, altering tone) to generate offspring.\nAn alternative approach implemented in Plum [21] is based on metaheuristics. Unlike EvoPrompt\u2019s prompt mu-\ntation methodology, Plum explicitly defines a set of prompt modification operations: adding, deleting, rephrasing\nwords/phrases, or swapping their positions, thereby generating multiple neighboring prompts. The solution architecture\ncomprises: a well-defined set of neighboring prompts for each prompt, a metaheuristic algorithm with its inherent\nhyperparameters, and auxiliary functions (including crossover). The study examines six algorithms: hill climbing\n[10], simulated annealing [25], genetic algorithm (two variants - with mutation and crossover, and mutation-only) [9],\ntabu search [5], and harmony search [31]. Each algorithm performs candidate mutation through the application of\npredefined modification operations, enabling exploration within the discrete prompt space. It should be noted that only\nthe rephrasing operation is executed via LLM queries, while other operations are performed manually. As described by\nthe authors, experimental results demonstrate this approach\u2019s capability to identify novel structural prompt modifications\nthat enhance performance.\nIn Promptbreeder [6] paper, the authors propose an extended genetic algorithm mutation approach incorporating\npredefined mutation prompts and \"thinking styles\" (concise descriptions of cognitive strategies, e.g., \"Let\u2019s think step by\nstep\"), in addition to utilizing Chain-of-Thought [35] and Plan-and-Solve [32] techniques. At each iteration, candidates\n2\n\nReflectivePrompt: Reflective evolution in autoprompting algorithms\nare improved through the application of a randomly selected mutation from a uniform distribution. The authors identify\nfive mutation classes: direct mutation, hypermutation, estimation of distribution mutation [20], Lamarckian mutation\n[24], and prompt crossover/context shuffling. The first two classes further include zero-order and first-order mutations,\ntotaling ten distinct mutations, each implemented through LLM queries. First-order direct mutation modifies candidates\nusing specific mutation prompts, while zero-order mutation utilizes the initial problem statement to address method\ndivergence. When problem specifications lack precision, Lamarckian mutation facilitates prompt reconstruction based\non the last output yielding correct results. The algorithm\u2019s key innovation involves hypermutation, which modifies the\nmutation prompts themselves (via hypermutation prompts), thereby enhancing not only prompt solutions but also the\nimprovement mechanisms. According to the authors, this diversity of operators enables continuous reformulation and\nrepresentation of problems by LLMs, leading to more effective solutions [6]. This approach demonstrates adaptability\nacross various domains while optimizing prompts and preserving their interpretability.\n2\nReflectivePrompt\n2.1\nReflective Evolution\nReflective evolution is an approach described in the article ReEvo: Large Language Models as Hyper-Heuristics with\nReflective Evolution [36]. Its essence lies in using a language model to generate prompts aimed at enhancing the\nefficiency of mutation and crossover operations. The processes of prompt creation are referred to as short-term and\nlong-term reflection. According to the authors, such reflective actions can be interpreted as obtaining a \"verbal gradient\"\nwithin the prompt space. Short-term reflection involves generating crossover prompts based solely on the current parent\npopulation, while long-term reflection, as the name suggests, entails accumulating knowledge, dependencies, and\nmethods for improving efficiency throughout the entire evolutionary operation.\nThe application of reflection helps guide the direction of mutation and crossover operations while also expanding\nthe search space, potentially moving beyond the initial population\u2019s predefined prompt space. In the original article,\nthis approach was successfully applied to solving problems such as Guided Local Search (GLS) [30], Ant Colony\nOptimization (ACO) [3], Electronic Design Automation (EDA) [27], the Decap Placement Problem (DPP) [12], the\nTraveling Salesman Problem (TSP) [7], and other combinatorial optimization tasks.\n2.2\nProposed solution\nIn this study we developed a novel approach that combines methods of reflective evolution with large language models\nfor the automatic generation of higher-quality prompts \u2014 ReflectivePrompt. ReflectivePrompt employs short-term and\nlong-term reflection operations for subsequent use in crossover and elitist mutation. All performed operations and their\ncorresponding queries to the language model were modified and refined to directly optimize prompts.\nSpecifically, the beginning of each instruction was changed to: \"You are an expert in the domain of optimization\nprompts. Your task is to give hints to design better prompts.\" This adjustment is motivated by the specifics of the\nautoprompting task, for which reflective evolution was applied. Techniques describing possible modification operations\nperformed during crossover and mutation, previously used in the SPELL algorithm, were incorporated. Thus, the\nfollowing was added to the model queries defining short-term and long-term reflection: \"For example, you can try to\nrecommend word replacements, active/positive voice conversions, adding words, or deleting words.\" This enables the\nLLM to generate more precise, well-described hints that affect not only the semantic content of prompts but also their\nstructural aspects.\nReflectivePrompt simplifies user interaction by generating an initial population of prompts based on just a single input\nprompt. In this approach, the prompt is rephrased using the LLM and structured output techniques [17].\nA key feature of ReflectivePrompt is delegating the decision on the specifics of mutation to the model itself. In\npreviously described solutions, the mutation type was either predefined and fixed or randomly selected from a uniform\ndistribution. In this approach, however, the model generates hints autonomously and tends to decide whether to apply\nstructural transformations to the prompt or only modify its semantic meaning and phrasing.\nWhen performing crossover and mutation operations, the LLM is provided with a brief task description, which helps\ngenerate more problem-targeted prompts while preserving the logical structure of the instruction. Empirical observations\nhave shown that even large models can achieve decent metric values using prompts that are partially or entirely irrelevant\nto the task. As a result, the final prompts may deviate significantly from the intended meaning. ReflectivePrompt avoids\nthis issue and, in the vast majority of cases, generates semantically correct prompts that are more comprehensible to\nhuman perception and logic.\nThe general scheme of reflective evolution within ReflectivePrompt is illustrated in Figure 1.\n3\n\nReflectivePrompt: Reflective evolution in autoprompting algorithms\nFigure 1: The Reflective Evolution pipeline in ReflectivePrompt\nParticular attention should be paid to the two selection operations. The parent population selection of prompts chooses\npairs of parent prompts from the current population. In this process, each prompt can be included in multiple parent\npairs. The main constraint, which is related to the original reflective evolution algorithm, is that prompts in a parent pair\nmust have different fitness function values. Parent selection is performed using the roulette-wheel method [16]. The\nprobability vector for being selected for each individual is represented by the normalized vector of their fitness scores.\nThe second selection operation, which mimics the survival of the fittest, also employs the roulette-wheel method, but in\nthis case, the probabilities are obtained by applying a softmax operation with a temperature of 0.1 to the fitness function\nvalue vector. This temperature value yields a less uniform distribution in cases where all prompts have approximately\nsimilar scores, thereby increasing the probability of selection for individuals with higher fitness values.\nAnother crucial aspect is the preservation of elite individuals in the population. Before the start of each epoch, the\nindividual that has demonstrated the best performance throughout the entire evolutionary process is reintroduced into\nthe population, even if it was not selected at the end of the previous iteration. This approach enhances the algorithm\u2019s\nconvergence speed, as the best individuals are not lost over time due to unfavorable selection outcomes.\nThe examples of ReflectivePrompt optimization are shown in Figures 2 and 3.\nFigure 2: The optimized prompt for SST-2 dataset\n4\n\nParent population selection}\n\nParent population\n\nPopulation\n\nPrevious long-term\n\nLong-term\n\nreflection\n\nEltist\n\nreflection\n\nNew long-term\nreflection\n\n\u2018 \u2018\n>{ Ranking \u2014)-\u2014(Shorttermreftecion) ( crossover\nx\nShort-term\nreflections\n\nEltist mutation\n\n[Crossed population\n\nMutated population\n\nSelection\n\nPopulation\n\n\nInitial prompt:\n\u201cPlease provide a Sentiment Classification task.\u201d\n\nOptimized prompt:\n\u201cCould you please conduct a Sentiment Classification\nexercise on movie reviews?\u201d\n\n\nReflectivePrompt: Reflective evolution in autoprompting algorithms\nFigure 3: The optimized prompt for BBH/logical_deduction_three_objects\n3\nExperimental Evaluation\n3.1\nExperimental Setup\nReflectivePrompt was evaluated on 33 datasets for text classification and generation tasks. As baselines and reference\npoints for comparison, we used results from EvoPrompt, SPELL, PromptBreeder, and Plum. The autoprompting\nalgorithms were executed using large language models from different families and sizes (t-lite-instruct-0.1, gemma3-\n27b-it [29]). This choice of LLMs was made due to the use of open source white-box models which are more\nuser-friendly and can be utilized by everyone. Also the significant difference in the number of model parameters leads\nto better testing coverage and makes our results more unbiased.\n5\n\nInitial prompt:\n\"Identify the position of each object in a fixed order based on the given statements in\neach input-output pair.\"\n\nOptimized prompt:\n\n\"Determine the order of three objects based on the given statements.

You will be provided with a list of statements\n\nabout the objects, and your task is to analyze these statements to deduce the\n\ncorrect order of the objects.\n\nFor each paragraph, you will find three objects and a set of statements. These\nstatements will describe the objects\" dimensions, weights, or positions relative\nto each other. Use this information to deduce the correct order of the objects.\nFor example, consider the paragraph below:\n\n1. The object on the left is smaller than the object in the middle.\n\n2. The object in the middle is larger than the object on the right.\n\n3. The object on the right is transparent.\n\nBased on these statements, determine the correct order of the objects. The possible\norderings are:\n\nA. Left, Middle, Right\n\nB. Middle, Left, Right\n\nC. Right, Middle, Left\n\nD.

The metric selected for\nevaluation and optimization during evolution was the F1-score. The results of each method are presented in Figures 4-5.\nFigure 4: Histogram of F1-score values.

Across all evaluated datasets, ReflectivePrompt either outperformed or matched the performance of existing\nevolutionary algorithm-based autoprompting methods. The method showed particularly strong results on the BBH\nbenchmark, comprising 23 classification tasks and 4 text generation tasks. For classification tasks, the average F1-score\nimproved by 6.59% on the t-lite-instruct-0.1 model and by 0.96% on the gemma3-27b-it model. In text generation tasks,\nthe average METEOR score increased by 33.34% on the t-lite-instruct-0.1 model (comparisons and improvements\nwere calculated relative to the maximum average metrics achieved by existing solutions). It should be noted that\nReflectivePrompt\u2019s performance significantly depends on the underlying LLM. The effectiveness of reflective evolution\nrelies on the quality of generated hints, and weaker language models may produce suggestions that are not fully relevant\nto the optimization task. This work creates a scope for future research into reflective evolution for autoprompting\napplications. The current ReflectivePrompt implementation could potentially be further refined for more targeted prompt\noptimization. Moreover, the concept of reflective evolution could be generalized and adapted to other metaheuristic\noptimization algorithms, representing a promising direction for future studies. For example, there was a recent research\nwhere reflective prompt evolution outperforms reinforcement learning on a group of benchmarks [1].\n7\n\nMETEOR\n\n05\n\n04\n\n03\n\n02\n\n01\n\n0.218\n\n0.214\n\n0.042\n\n0.027\n0.017,\nBee\n\nGSM8K\nDatasets\n\n0.035\n\n0.028\n\nMethods\n\nEvoPrompt\n\n@ SPELL\n\nPromptBreeder\nPlum\nReflectivePrompt\n\nMETEOR\n\n05\n\n04\n\n03\n\n02\n\n01\n\n0.143 _ 0.150\n\n0.146\nLE a\n\nGSM8K\nDatasets\n\n.\n0.423 _ 0.425\n0.406 .\n=\n=\n\nMethods\n\n0.423 0.426\n\nSamSUM\n\nEvoPrompt\nSPELL\nPromptBreeder\nPlum\nReflectivePrompt\n\nReflectivePrompt: Reflective evolution in autoprompting algorithms\n5\nConclusion\nThe proposed ReflectivePrompt algorithm, which employs reflective evolution for prompt optimization, was evaluated\non 33 datasets covering various natural language processing domains.

However, current LLMs are often observed\nto generate incorrect answers with high confidence\u2014a phenomenon known as\n\u201coverconfidence\u201d. Recent efforts have focused on calibrating LLMs\u2019 verbalized\nconfidence: i.e., their expressions of confidence in text form, such as \u201cI am 80% con-\nfident that...\u201d. Existing approaches either rely on prompt engineering or fine-tuning\nwith heuristically generated uncertainty estimates, both of which have limited effec-\ntiveness and generalizability. Motivated by the notion of proper scoring rules for\ncalibration in classical machine learning models, we introduce ConfTuner, a simple\nand efficient fine-tuning method that introduces minimal overhead and does not\nrequire ground-truth confidence scores or proxy confidence estimates. ConfTuner\nrelies on a new loss function, tokenized Brier score, which we theoretically prove to\nbe a proper scoring rule, intuitively meaning that it \u201ccorrectly incentivizes the model\nto report its true probability of being correct\u201d.

This capability is\nparticularly important in high-stakes domains such as scientific inquiry [1], law [19], and healthcare\n[21], where decision quality and interpretability are essential. However, current LLMs are not\nexplicitly trained to express calibrated uncertainty. As a result, they often report very high confidence\neven when producing hallucinated or incorrect content [14, 28, 13, 32]. This overconfidence problem\nundermines trust and poses serious challenges for the safe deployment of LLMs (Figure 1).\nRecent efforts [30, 32, 22, 33, 29] have focused on improving the elicitation of verbalized confidence\nfrom LLMs. Prompt-based methods rely on carefully crafted instructions [30, 32], but have shown\nlimited effects in improving calibration [30, 32]. Alternatively, training-based approaches fine-tune\n\u2217Corresponding author\nPreprint.

A standard LLM confidently produces an incorrect diagnosis, while a calibrated LLM\nexpresses appropriate uncertainty. Thus, the doctor will prescribe a safer, more reliable action.\nLLMs on synthetic datasets annotated with uncertainty estimates. Due to the lack of ground truth\nconfidence scores, current methods typically rely on heuristically generated proxy scores as targets,\nsuch as the model\u2019s average accuracy over a group of similar questions [22], consistency across\nmultiple responses [33], or model judgment [29]. However, using group-level statistics as a proxy\nfor single-instance confidence relies on the strong assumption that the questions within each group\nare equivalent, sampling-based methods increase both computational costs and random noise, and\nmodel judgment introduces model bias. Consequently, there remains a need for more principled\nand efficient approaches that more directly align an LLM\u2019s verbalized confidence with the actual\nreliability of its responses.\nMotivated by this gap, we pose the central research question: Can LLMs be naturally calibrated\nduring training without relying on ground-truth confidence scores or proxy confidence esti-\nmates? Our approach is inspired by the fact that classical machine learning classifiers naturally\nbecome well-calibrated during training when optimized with loss functions that are proper scoring\nrules [3, 8], such as the Brier score [5], which theoretically encourage the model to make probability\nestimates that reflect the true likelihood of correctness. Building on this insight, we introduce the no-\ntion of proper scoring rules for verbalized confidence, which formalizes the notion of a loss function\nthat encourages LLMs to generate tokens that verbally express the true likelihood of correctness.\nWe propose ConfTuner, a simple and efficient fine-tuning method that optimizes a custom-designed\nloss function, the tokenized Brier score. We show that this loss function has the key property of being\na proper scoring rule for verbalized confidence, thus correctly incentivizing the LLM\u2019s confidence\nexpressions. In theory, fine-tuning using this loss naturally leads to accurate verbalized confidence,\nwhile requiring minimal overhead to existing fine-tuning pipelines, without relying on ground-truth\nconfidence scores, proxy confidence estimates, or repeated sampling.\nConfTuner provides more accurate confidence scores than the best baseline (up to 54.7% improvement\nin ECE and 14.4% in AUROC), and generalizes better across unseen datasets with diverse reasoning\ntasks, different formats of confidence expression, and even implicit confidence expressions. We\nalso assess its effectiveness in calibrating the outputs of black-box models such as GPT-4o [26].\nConfTuner\u2019s strong empirical performance suggests a meaningful alignment between its verbalized\nconfidence and the underlying uncertainty. Beyond standard calibration metrics, we explore its\nbroader utility in enhancing the trustworthiness of LLM-based systems. In particular, we show that\nwell-calibrated confidence enables practical benefits, including improved LLM self-correction and\nbetter model cascade. These findings indicate that accurate confidence estimation not only enhances\nmodel interpretability and downstream performance, but also holds strong promise for advancing\nreliable and collaborative human\u2013AI interaction.\n2\nBackground: Calibration in Classification Settings\nA key motivation behind our work is the intuition that binary classifiers trained using Brier score\nnaturally become calibrated during training, without needing any extra supervision about their\nconfidence [3, 8]. For example, when a binary classifier outputs a probability of 0.8, we often\ninterpret this as predicting with 80% confidence that the true label is 1. We can do this because the\nclassifier is trained using losses that are proper scoring rules [3], such as Brier score. Intuitively, this\nmeans that such losses incentivize the classifier to output probabilities that reflect the model\u2019s true\nlikelihood of correctness. Next, we more formally define the notion of proper scoring rules.\nProper Scoring Rules. Let X represent an input sample, and Y \u2208[0, 1] indicate whether the model\u2019s\nprediction is correct. The conditional correctness probability is the true probability that Y = 1 given\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidence levels (0-100)\nLLM\nPlease\nprovide\nyour\nAnswer\n:\nYes\nConfidence\n:\n...\n99\n...\n...\n...\n0\n1\n100\n99\n2\n3\n4\n98\n97\n96\n...\n...\n...\n100\n99\n98\n97\n96\nFine-tune based on tokenized Brier score\n...\nConfidence token\n5\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n5\nProbability distribution\nAnswer: Yes.\nConfidence: 99 %\nPlese provide your answer and confidence \n(0%-100%) for the question. \nQuestion: Is 1051 larger than 1039 + 15? \nAnswer: Yes.\nConfidence: 5 %\nStandard LLM\nCalibrated LLM\nAfter fine-tuning\nStage 1\nStage 2\nFigure 2: An overview of ConfTuner. In the first stage, we compute the model\u2019s probability\ndistribution over the confidence levels of 0-100. In the second stage, we use the tokenized Brier score\nto calibrate the probability distribution, converting misaligned confidence 99% to 5%.\nX, defined as:\n\u03b7(X) := Pr\n\u0000Y = 1 | X\n\u0001\n.\nA scoring rule \u2113(p, y) : [0, 1] \u00d7 {0, 1} \u2192R\u22650 is called proper if its expected loss (i.e., risk)\nRX(p) := E[ \u2113(p, Y ) | X ]\nis minimized when the prediction probability p matches the true correctness probability p = \u03b7(X)\nalmost surely.\nIn theory, a proper scoring rule encourages the model to make probability estimates that reflect the\ntrue likelihood of correctness [3]. In particular, the Brier score \u2113B(p, y) = (y \u2212p)2 has been proven\nto be a proper scoring rule [3].\n3\nConfTuner: Verbalized Calibration in Language Models\nFrom Classifiers to Language Models. Since LLMs are not explicitly trained to verbalize their\nconfidence, our goal is to enable LLMs to verbalize their confidence in a way that faithfully reflects\ntheir true likelihood of correctness. A typical use case, which we focus on for most of this paper, is\nwhere an LLM is given a question and is asked to provide both its answer and a verbalized expression\nof its confidence (such as a percentage).\nTraditional classifiers are generally fitted using proper scoring rules, providing an important theoretical\nguarantee that the classifiers are correctly incentivized to output numeric confidence p that matches\nthe true conditional probability \u03b7(X). However, we cannot directly apply the theory of proper scoring\nrules to verbalized calibration - the key difference is that in this case, instead of outputting a numeric\nconfidence p, the model outputs a token sequence such as \u201cConfidence: 80%\u201d, and our goal is for the\nmeaning of these tokens to accurately match the model\u2019s true probability of correctness.\nTo fill this gap, ConfTuner fine-tunes the model using a new loss function, the tokenized Brier score.\nThis score is designed to incentivize the language model to generate the confidence token that is as\nclose as possible to the true probability of correctness. For example, if the true conditional probability\nof a model\u2019s answer being correct is 0.667, the LLM should output the confidence token representing\n67%. We will formalize this by defining the notion of a proper scoring rule for verbalized calibration,\nwhich is a loss function that correctly incentivizes the LLM to generate the closest possible token to\nthe true likelihood of correctness. Then, we will show that our score satisfies this condition.\nConfTuner Overview. Our proposed algorithm, ConfTuner, consists of two key steps (see Figure 2):\n1. Compute Probability Distribution Over Confidence Tokens: Given a prompt that asks the LLM\nto output the answer and its confidence for a question, this step extracts the model\u2019s probability\ndistribution over a predefined set of confidence tokens.\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Fine-Tune Based on Tokenized Brier Score: The probability distribution is used to compute\na tokenized Brier score against the ground truth correctness of the generated answer, effectively\npenalizing miscalibrated confidence. We fine-tune the LLM based on the tokenized Brier score.\n3.1\nCompute Probability Distribution over Confidence Tokens\nOur ultimate goal is to ensure that the confidence tokens generated by the LLM align with the true\ncorrectness of its prediction. Concretely, given an input question x, we use a prompt that asks the\nLLM to output its answer, followed by expressing its confidence like \u201cConfidence: 80%\u201d. This token\nsequence consists of a fixed prefix (\u201cConfidence: \u201d), followed by a token from a predefined set of\nconfidence tokens TN := {0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N}. For simplicity, we assume that these tokens correspond to\nthe uniformly spaced probabilities of 0, 1/N, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 1 respectively. In the above example, we ask the\nmodel to express its confidence as a percentage, so our token set is T100 = {0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 100}. Another\nnatural choice would be to express confidence using a smaller number of confidence levels, such as\nT9 = {0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 9}. Our overall approach is not specific to any choice of N, but in practice we focus\non T100 and T9, as we consider these levels to be well-aligned with confidence expressions used in\nhuman communication, and are sufficiently fine-grained while being easy to interpret.\nOur goal is to encourage the model to assign the highest probability to the confidence level that best\nmatches the actual correctness of its generated answer. The first step toward this goal is to compute\nthe model\u2019s probability distribution over confidence tokens. We first instruct the LLM to generate its\nconfidence score over TN: e.g., for T100, we ask it for a percentage c%, where c \u2208{0, 1, . . . , 100}.\nWhen generating the token representing c, the model outputs a full logit vector f \u2208R|V| before the\nsoftmax layer. The logit vector f assigns a prediction score (logit) to each token in the vocabulary.\nWe then extract the logits for tokens in TN, denoted as f0, f1, . . . , fN. We then compute the softmax\nof these selected logits: qi =\nexp(fi)\nPN\nj=0 exp(fj), where qi represents the model\u2019s probability to generate\nthe confidence token i. This results in the probability vector q that we are interested in:\nq = (q0, . . . , qN) \u2208\u2206N+1,\n\u2206N+1 :=\nn\nq \u2208RN+1\n\u22650\n:\nN\nX\ni=0\nqi = 1\no\n.\n3.2\nFine-Tune Based on Tokenized Brier Score\nWe want to design a loss function applicable to LLMs that ensures that the loss-minimizing classifier\nis well-calibrated. To do so, we adapt the classical Brier score [5] to the tokenized setting: for a\nprediction vector q and correctness indicator y, define the tokenized Brier score:\n\u2113(q, y) :=\nN\nX\ni=0\nqi\n\u0000y \u2212i\nN\n\u00012.\n(1)\nHere (y \u2212i/N)2 is the squared error for the current sample that would be incurred if the model were\nto predict i as its confidence token. Since the model has a qi probability to generate confidence token\ni, this summation computes the model\u2019s error in expectation over its predictive distribution.\nThe Brier loss penalizes both overconfident and underconfident predictions. For example, as shown\nin Figure 2, the answer is incorrect (y = 0); thus, in Equation (1), the term (y \u2212i/N)2 becomes\n(0 \u2212i/N)2. This term is minimized (equals 0) when i = 0 and maximized (equals 1) when i = N.\nTherefore, to minimize \u2113(q, y), the model is incentivized to assign a high probability to the logit q0\nrepresenting 0 confidence and low probabilities to the logit qN representing N. Similarly, for other\nconfidence levels, the model will also encourage high probability for low confidence levels and low\nprobability for high confidence levels. Conversely, if the answer is correct (y = 1), the term becomes\n(1 \u2212i/N)2, which is minimized (equals 0) for i = N and maximized (equals 1) for i = 0.\nThe tokenized Brier score guides the fine-tuning process, iteratively adjusting the model\u2019s parameters\nto produce better-calibrated confidence assessments alongside answers.\n3.3\nProper Scoring Rules for Verbalized Calibration\nIn this section, we define the notion of a proper scoring rule for verbalized calibration, which is a\nloss function that correctly incentivizes the LLM to generate the closest possible token to the true\nlikelihood of correctness. Then, we will show that the tokenized Brier score satisfies this condition.\n4\n\nLet X be a random variable representing the input question, and Y be an indicator random variable\nY \u2208{0, 1} for whether the LLM answers the question correctly (1) or incorrectly (0). We consider\ni.i.d. training examples (x, y) drawn from an unknown distribution D with density p(x, y) = p(y |\nx)p(x). Like before, for a fixed input x, the conditional probability that the model is correct is:\n\u03b7(x) := Pr\n\u0000Y = 1 | X = x\n\u0001\n\u2208[0, 1].\nIn what follows we fix a single input x and denote \u03b7 = \u03b7(x) for brevity.\nDefinition 1 (Proper Scoring Rule for Verbalized Confidence). Fix an input x with Bayesian correct-\nness probability \u03b7 = Pr(Y = 1 | X = x). Consider the conditional risk\nRx(q) := E[ \u2113(q, Y ) | X = x ],\nq \u2208\u2206N+1,\n(2)\nLet\nk :=\narg min\ni\u2208{0,...,N}\n\f\f\u03b7 \u2212i\nN\n\f\f,\nThe loss \u2113(q, y) is a proper scoring rule for verbalized confidence if its risk is minimized when the\nLLM\u2019s output probability distribution, q, is a deterministic distribution putting all its mass on the\ntoken k: i.e., qk = 1 and qj = 0 for all j \u0338= k.\nTheorem 1 (Tokenized Brier Score correctly incentivizes verbalized confidence). The tokenized\nBrier score \u2113(q, y), as defined in (1), is a proper scoring rule for verbalized confidence.\nThe proof can be found in Appendix B. Theorem 1 indicates that the tokenized Brier score is a\nproper scoring rule, i.e., an LLM fine-tuned on this score will place all its probability mass on the\ntoken whose confidence value is closest to the true conditional correctness probability.\n4\nExperiments\nIn this section, we first provide the experimental setup, then investigate whether ConfTuner learns\neffective verbalized confidence estimation and how this capability enables more trustworthy LLM\nsystems. Finally, we compare the training/inference time and training data size, demonstrating the\nefficiency of ConfTuner.\n4.1\nExperimental Setup\nDatasets. Following [33], we use HotpotQA [35] for training, which typically requires multi-step\nreasoning to derive the answer. For evaluation, besides the evaluation set of HotpotQA, we also adopt:\n1) TriviaQA [15], which includes open-domain trivia questions and source documents; following\n[29], we sample 1,000 for evaluation. 2) StrategyQA [9], where the required reasoning steps are\nimplicit in the question, and should be inferred strategically. 3) GSM8K [6], a benchmark comprising\nlinguistically diverse and high-quality mathematics questions designed for grade school students.\nHere we sample 1,000 for evaluation. 4) TruthfulQA [23], which evaluates how models balance\nfactual accuracy against response utility, using questions that commonly mislead humans.\nBaselines. We evaluate ConfTuner on top of three base LLMs: Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct [10], Qwen2.5-\n7B-Instruct [34], Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410 [24] (An enhanced variant of Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3).\nFor brevity, we refer to these models as LLaMA, Qwen, and Ministral, respectively, throughout the\npaper. We compare ConfTuner against the following baselines: 1) Base: The original, unmodified\nLLM. 2) Ensemble: The LLM is prompted three times to generate top-k answers with confidence,\nand the verbalized confidence scores are averaged to produce the final confidence estimate. 3)\nTwo training-based methods: SaySelf [33] and LACIE [29]. For LACIE, we constructed training\ndatasets following their original implementations. For SaySelf, we directly use their training dataset\n(constructed based on HotpotQA). We ensure fair comparison by: i) using the same inference-time\nprompting strategy, and ii) re-training SaySelf and LACIE using the same base LLMs on HotpotQA.\nFor inference, we use greedy decoding for all the methods, except for Ensemble, which requires\nsampling multiple responses.\nEvaluation Metrics. To assess the quality of confidence estimates, we employ two metrics following\nprevious works [32, 18, 33, 29]: Expected Calibration Error (ECE) [25] and Area Under the ROC\nCurve (AUROC) [4]. ECE measures the gap between a model\u2019s predicted confidence and its empirical\n5\n\nTable 1: ECE scores (\u2193) of all the methods.

Lower ECE indicates better calibration.\nFurther details, such as implementation details, evaluation environments, details of evaluation metrics,\nhyperparameter settings, and prompts, are available in Appendix C and D.\n4.2\nCan ConfTuner Learn Effective Verbalized Confidence Estimation Capabilities?\nTo investigate whether ConfTuner shows good performance for verbalized confidence estimation, we\nconduct experiments to assess its generalization across novel datasets, different forms of confidence\nrepresentation, and its adaptation to black-box models.\nGeneralization to Unseen Datasets. To assess ConfTuner\u2019s generalization, we evaluate its perfor-\nmance on the in-distribution dataset HotpotQA [35] and four out-of-distribution datasets: GSM8K\n[6], TriviaQA [15], StrategyQA [9], and TruthfulQA [23]. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, ConfTuner\nconsistently achieves higher AUROC and lower ECE values across all three base models, indicating\nits robust generalization. Overall, training-based methods, SaySelf and LACIE, outperform the\nprompt-based method, Ensemble. This is primarily because even though Ensemble utilizes multiple\nsampling strategies, the model inherently lacks the capacity to provide reliable confidence estimates.\nWe also illustrate ConfTuner\u2019s accuracy among different confidence levels in Figure 3, where Conf-\nTuner shows minimal accuracy-confidence gaps (red bars). Accuracy results and comparison to the\nlogit-based method can be found in Appendix F.\nGeneralization to Different Format of Confidence Scores. We further investigate whether Conf-\nTuner learns format-agnostic confidence estimation. We train ConfTuner on numerical confidence\n(0%-100%) and test it on linguistic confidence expressions (high/medium/low) across five datasets.\nBecause the exact confidence probabilities corresponding to high, medium, and low are undefined, we\nfocus only on AUROC, which only evaluates whether the model assigns higher confidence to correct\npredictions than incorrect ones. The results in Table 3 report AUROC scores on ConfTuner and\nbaselines (excluding Ensemble, which cannot produce linguistic confidence). ConfTuner consistently\nachieves superior AUROC scores, indicating that ConfTuner can also adapt to other formats of\nconfidence levels, highlighting its potential for practical applications, where intuitive confidence\ncommunication is critical. Compared to directly utilizing numerical confidence, the slight drop in\nAUROC might be attributed to the inherently coarse-grained nature of linguistic confidence. Accuracy\ncomparison can be found in Appendix F.\nGeneralization to Implicit Confidence Expressions. We conduct experiments to investigate whether\nConfTuner could also provide implicit confidence expressions. In the inference stage, instead of\n6\n\nTable 2: AUROC scores (\u2191) of all the methods.\nIn-distribution\nOut-of-distribution\nLLM\nMethod\nHotpotQA\nGSM8K TriviaQA StrategyQA TruthfulQA Average\nLLaMA\nBase\n0.6884\n0.5028\n0.6023\n0.6249\n0.5433\n0.5923\nEnsemble\n0.6035\n0.5210\n0.6323\n0.6022\n0.6038\n0.5926\nLACIE\n0.7233\n0.5117\n0.6818\n0.6525\n0.5452\n0.6229\nSaySelf\n0.6596\n0.5425\n0.6202\n0.5493\n0.5890\n0.5921\nConfTuner\n0.7383\n0.7007\n0.6821\n0.6750\n0.5739\n0.6740\nQwen\nBase\n0.6863\n0.5114\n0.6224\n0.6059\n0.6517\n0.6155\nEnsemble\n0.6259\n0.5683\n0.6287\n0.5959\n0.6460\n0.6130\nLACIE\n0.7141\n0.5473\n0.6951\n0.6312\n0.6397\n0.6455\nSaySelf\n0.6972\n0.5247\n0.6133\n0.6265\n0.6312\n0.6186\nConfTuner\n0.7180\n0.5841\n0.7664\n0.6692\n0.6926\n0.6861\nMinistral\nBase\n0.5198\n0.5133\n0.5078\n0.5129\n0.5541\n0.5216\nEnsemble\n0.5679\n0.6696\n0.5004\n0.6222\n0.6153\n0.5951\nLACIE\n0.6505\n0.5126\n0.5128\n0.6134\n0.6098\n0.5798\nSaySelf\n0.6482\n0.5133\n0.5477\n0.5555\n0.6060\n0.5740\nConfTuner\n0.7907\n0.6700\n0.7389\n0.5147\n0.6906\n0.6810\n(a) Base\n(b) LACIE\n(c) SaySelf\n(d) Ensemble\n(e) ConfTuner\nFigure 3: Reliability diagrams of all the methods on HotpotQA and TriviaQA. For perfect calibration,\nthe accuracy should align with the predicted confidence, i.e., the blue bars should align with the red\nline. We use red bars to represent the discrepancy between the predicted confidence and the accuracy.\nConfTuner has fewer red bars, indicating its better calibration.\nprompt ConfTuner (based on LLaMA) to generate confidence levels from 0 to 100%, we prompt\nConfTuner: \u201cPlease express your uncertainty when providing the answer\u201d. Under this instruction,\nConfTuner also produces implicit confidence expressions, such as \u201cI\u2019m fairly certain, but there\u2019s a\nchance I could be mistaken\u201d or \u201cThis is a tough one, so I\u2019d say it\u2019s likely but not guaranteed.\u201d We\nevaluate these implicit confidence by inputting them to GPT-4o to assess the implied confidence\nlevels (0-100%). The results of AUROC and ECE are shown in Table 4, demonstrating that implicit\nconfidence calibration of ConfTuner is comparable to explicit confidence calibration.\nCalibration for Other Models. ConfTuner also offers a solution to calibrate confidence for answers\nof black-box models (e.g., GPT-4o), which is hard to train. We train ConfTuner (based on LLaMA)\nto provide confidence levels for GPT-4o\u2019s responses. As shown in Table 5, ConfTuner achieves\nhigher AUROC and lower ECE scores, indicating improved calibration. This proxy calibration has\nthe potential to effectively assess and mitigate overconfidence risks in black-box systems.

We specifically investigate whether ConfTuner enables better\nself-correction ability, and whether ConfTuner enables better reliability-cost balance.\nConfTuner Improves the Self-correction Ability of LLM. Self-correction offers a straightforward\nmethod to enhance LLM reliability by directly instructing the model to refine its answers [7].\nWe conduct self-correction experiments on HotpotQA and TruthfulQA, where LLMs demonstrate\nhigh error rates and low confidence. Specifically, we first instruct LLM to generate answers and\nconfidences, then retain initial responses with high confident (larger than 0.5) answers, and instruct\nLLM to refine low-confident (smaller than 0.5) answers. As presented in Figure 4, ConfTuner (based\non Qwen) achieves larger improvements on both datasets. In contrast, baselines show marginal gains\nor even degradation. This is because baselines are more likely to provide low confidence for correct\nanswers, misleading LLMs to modify correct responses into incorrect ones. The detailed accuracy\nresults can be found in Appendix F.\nConfTuner Achieves Higher Performance Gain at Same Cost in Confidence-Based Model\nCascade Systems. One important application of accurate confidence estimation is in confidence-\nbased model cascades, where a base model\u2019s low-confidence outputs trigger selective intervention by\na stronger model to improve reliability while keeping the overall cost low. We evaluate whether the\nconfidence estimates produced by ConfTuner can better support this process. Specifically, we compare\nLLaMA and its fine-tuned version, ConfTuner, by using their confidence scores to select 100 to 400\nlow-confidence samples for further refinement by GPT-4o [26]. As shown in Figure 5, ConfTuner\nconsistently achieves higher refined accuracy, with improvements of up to 9.3% on HotpotQA and\n8\n\nTable 5: AUROC (\u2191) and ECE (\u2193) of GPT-4o and ConfTuner.

Prior works [18, 16, 2] have explored\ncalibrating confidence scores based on the logits of LLM-generated answers, but these logits are often\ninaccessible to users, hindering practical use. To address this, recent studies [32, 30, 29, 33, 22] have\nfocused on eliciting verbalized confidence directly from LLM outputs. Initial approaches [32, 30]\nleveraged prompt strategies to guide LLMs to directly output confidence levels. While flexible, these\nmethods often yield poorly calibrated verbalized confidence. Recent efforts [22] have shifted toward\n9\n\nAccuracy Change Rate (%)\n\nBase\n\nHotpotQA\n\nLACIE SaySelf\n\nConfTuner\n\nAccuracy Change Rate (%)\n\nBase\n\nTruthftulQA\n\nLACIE SaySelf\n\nConfTuner\n\n06 HotpotQA TruthfulQA\n\n\u2014@\u2014 Base +9. 3%\n\u2014\u2122\u2014 ConfTuner | +7.5%\n\n+5.9%\n\n+5 5%\n\n\u00a9\noO\n\noO\niN\n\nAccuracy\n+\nIS\n(oY)\nxe\n\n0.3\n100 200 300 400 100 200 300 400\n\nModified Samples Modified Samples\n\nfine-tuning LLMs to produce verbalized confidence scores, typically by training models to map\nentire question categories to predefined confidence values. However, this category-level calibration\nassumes the same uncertainty scores across all questions within a class, an unrealistic premise that\nignores question-level variations in difficulty or ambiguity. To overcome this, SaySelf [33] proposes\nquestion-level calibration, where confidence is estimated for individual questions. Yet, it often\nrequires sampling multiple responses per question to infer confidence levels, which is suboptimal and\nincurs significant computational costs. LACIE [29] utilizes a preference dataset where responses are\nlabeled for confidence levels. Its training objective is to encourage models to produce correct and\nconfident or incorrect and unconfident responses. However, a key limitation of this approach is its\nreliance on model judgment for the initial confident/unconfident labeling, which is not accurate.\nMore related work for traditional calibration methods can be found in Appendix A\n6\nConclusion and Future Work\nIn this work, we focus on the critical challenge of LLM overconfidence, which is especially important\nin high-risk applications. We address this issue by calibrating the verbalized confidence of LLMs.\nWe propose a tokenized Brier score to fine-tune the LLM on the probability distribution of different\nconfidence levels, and theoretically prove that this score is a proper scoring rule, ensuring that it\ncorrectly incentivizes the verbalized confidence during training. We further propose our ConfTuner\nframework to fine-tune the LLM. Experimental results demonstrate that ConfTuner has learned\neffective verbalized confidence estimation, and this ability can enable more trustworthy LLM systems.\nLimitations and Future Work. Looking ahead, several considerations remain in fully realizing the\npotential of ConfTuner: 1) Generalization to Complex Contexts. Though experiments demonstrate\nthat ConfTuner trained with a fixed set of confidence tokens generalizes to alternative expressions,\nit remains an open question as to how far we can extend it toward more complex conversational\ncontexts and more diverse confidence expressions. However, ConfTuner represents a meaningful\ninitial step toward integrating uncertainty awareness into LLMs through the proper scoring rule,\noffering advantages over heuristic methods. In the future, we plan to extend ConfTuner to more\nflexible and context-aware uncertainty expressions. 2) Practical Calibration Challenges. While\nproper scoring rules provide a principled objective for calibration, achieving well-calibrated models\nin practice often depends on many other factors, including data quality, model architecture, and\noptimization dynamics [11], which we plan to analyze in order to better align theoretical guarantees\nwith real-world performance.\n10\n\nReferences\n[1] Akari Asai, Jacqueline He*, Rulin Shao*, Weijia Shi, Amanpreet Singh, Joseph Chee Chang,\nKyle Lo, Luca Soldaini, Sergey Feldman, Tian, D\u2019arcy Mike, David Wadden, Matt Latzke,\nMinyang, Pan Ji, Shengyan Liu, Hao Tong, Bohao Wu, Yanyu Xiong, Luke Zettlemoyer, Dan\nWeld, Graham Neubig, Doug Downey, Wen-tau Yih, Pang Wei Koh, and Hannaneh Hajishirzi.\nOpenScholar: Synthesizing scientific literature with retrieval-augmented language models.\nArxiv, 2024.\n[2] Amos Azaria and Tom M.

PMLR, 2020.\n13\n\nA\nRelated Works\nTraditional Confidence Calibration.\nTraditional confidence calibration methods largely fall\ninto two categories: scaling-based and binning-based methods. Scaling-based techniques, such\nas temperature scaling [11], modify predicted probabilities by applying a learned scalar to all\nsamples, while more advanced variations like parameterized temperature scaling [31] introduce\ninput-dependent adjustments for greater expressiveness, and Mix-n-Match [38] employs ensemble\nand composition strategies for data-efficient and accuracy-preserving estimates. On the other hand,\nbinning-based methods, including classic histogram binning [36], mutual-information-maximization-\nbased binning [27], and isotonic regression [37], group samples into multiple bins according to their\nconfidence scores and then calibrate each bin individually. Despite these varied approaches, existing\ncalibration methods cannot be directly used for verbalized confidence calibration.\nB\nProof of Theorem 1\nProof. Conditioned on the fixed x, the quantity pi is deterministic while Y \u223cBernoulli(\u03b7). Using\nlinearity of expectation and Y 2 = Y for binary labels,\nE[(Y \u2212pi)2 | X = x] = E[Y 2 \u22122Y pi + p2\ni | X = x]\n= \u03b7(1 \u2212pi)2 + (1 \u2212\u03b7)p2\ni .\nFor compactness, we set\nfi(\u03b7) := \u03b7(1 \u2212pi)2 + (1 \u2212\u03b7)p2\ni ,\n(3)\nso that Eq. (2) becomes Rx(q) = P100\ni=0 qi fi(\u03b7).\nObserve that Rx(q) is a linear function of q. Because the feasible set \u2206101 is the convex hull of its\nvertices (the standard basis vectors), the minimum of a linear function over \u2206101 is always attained at\na vertex. Hence it suffices to look for a deterministic solution, which places probability 1 on a single\nindex and 0 on all others.\nIt remains to identify the best index. Extend the grid {0, 1/N, . . . , 1} to the closed interval [0, 1] and\ndefine for a continuous variable p \u2208[0, 1]\ng(p) := \u03b7(1 \u2212p)2 + (1 \u2212\u03b7)p2 = \u03b7 \u22122\u03b7p + p2.\nThis is a convex quadratic. Differentiating, we obtain g\u2032(p) = 2(p \u2212\u03b7), which vanishes only at\np = \u03b7. Because the second derivative g\u2032\u2032(p) = 2 > 0, this point is the global minimizer of g. Since\nthe quadratic is strictly convex and symmetric about its minimum point \u03b7, on the discrete grid the\nminimum is achieved by whichever grid point is closest to \u03b7. Formally,\nmin\ni\u2208{0,...,100} fi(\u03b7) = fk(\u03b7),\nwhere k is chosen as in the statement.\nCombining these two observations, (i) that the risk minimizer must be deterministic, and (ii) that\namong deterministic predictions the chosen index must be k, establishes the claim.\nC\nPrompts\nWe provide the prompts for all the tasks in our experiments in Table 7 and Table 8.\nD\nReproducibility Information\nD.1\nEvaluation Environments\nThe experiments are run with 6 Nvidia A40 GPUs.\nThe models are implemented with the\nHuggingface Transformers (https:// huggingface.co/) library.

Here we set B to\n10. AUROC evaluates the model\u2019s ability to separate correct from incorrect predictions through\nconfidence scores by examining whether correct predictions systematically receive higher confidence\nvalues than errors.\nAUROC can be calculated as:AUROC =\nR 1\n0 TPR(t) dFPR(t), where true positive rate TPR(t) and\nfalse positive rate FPR(t) are functions of the threshold t of confidence scores.\nD.3\nBaselines\n\u2022 SaySelf (MIT license): https://github.com/xu1868/SaySelf\n\u2022 LACIE (MIT license): https://github.com/esteng/pragmatic_calibration\n\u2022 Ensemble (MIT license): https://github.com/MiaoXiong2320/llm-uncertainty\nD.4\nImplementation Details\nWe train the models employing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [12] with rank of 8, the alpha value is\nset to 32, with adapters applied to all layers - specifically attached to the query and value projection\nmodules. Answer correctness is assessed as follows: for HotpotQA and TruthfulQA, we use GPT-4o\n[26] to judge the correctness. For other datasets, the model is instructed to extract the final answer,\nwhich is further compared to the ground truth. For ConfTuner and training-based baselines, the\ninference temperature was set to 0. For prompt-based baselines requiring non-deterministic generation,\nwe used the temperature specified in [32]. For LLaMA, we additionally add a regularization term and\ndiscuss the effect of it in Appendix E. We train LLaMA with T100 and train Qwen and Ministral with\nT9.\nD.5\nOptimal Parameters\nFor LLaMA, the optimal configuration was determined to be a learning rate of 1e-5, 2 training epochs,\nand a batch size of 16. The Ministral achieved peak performance with a slightly higher learning rate\nof 3e-5, 2 epochs, and the same batch size of 16. Meanwhile, the Qwen model required an extended\ntraining regimen of 3 epochs and a larger batch size of 24, paired with a learning rate of 1e-5.\nE\nAblation Study\nRegularization Term.\nWe additionally introduce a regularization term to encourage low divergence\nbetween the prediction of the fine-tuned model and the base model. This term is exactly the same as\nthe supervised fine-tuning loss Lsft = \u2212PT\nt=1 log P(yt|y<t, X; \u03b8), where X is the input of LLM, yt\nis the true token occur at time t, \u03b8 is the parameter of the LLM. We do an ablation study to show the\ninfluence of the regularization term. As shown in Table 9, the performance of LLaMA w/o con is\nworse than that of LLaMA w/ con. This is primarily because, after training, LLaMA w/ con sometimes\nomits confidence scores or generates repetitive text. Conversely, Qwen and Ministral-based model\ndemonstrated robust performance even without this regularization.\nTraining Data Size.\nTo investigate the impact of training data size on model performance, we train\nConfTuner (based on LLaMA) using datasets ranging from 500 to 10,000 samples. We evaluate\nConfTuner\u2019s average AUROC and ECE across five distinct datasets. As illustrated in Figure 6,\nConfTuner achieves good performance with as few as 2,000 training samples. This result highlights\nthat ConfTuner develops robust calibration capabilities even from limited data.\nImpact of Confidence Forms During Training.\nTo assess the impact of confidence representation\nduring training, we compare two approaches for LLaMA: using a continuous 0%-100% confidence\n17\n\nTable 9: ECE and AUROC metrics for dif-\nferent base models with (w/ reg) and without\nregularization (w/o reg).\nLLM\nContext\nECE \u2193\nAUROC \u2191\nLLaMA\nw/o reg\n0.0722\n0.7043\nw/ reg\n0.0405\n0.7383\nQwen\nw/o reg\n0.4212\n0.718\nw/ reg\n0.4359\n0.7242\nMinistral\nw/o reg\n0.1027\n0.7907\nw/ reg\n0.1797\n0.7338\nFigure 6: Impact of training data size on average\nAUROC and ECE on five datasets across three base\nmodels.

The results, presented in Table 10, demonstrate that the\n0%-100% scale lead to a marginal improvement in performance.\nE.1\nAblation on Training Distribution Shifts\nWe further train LLaMA on GSM8K (math problems) instead of HotpotQA (general knowledge from\nWikipedia). As shown in Table 11. ConfTuner trained on GSM8K performs better on GSM8K and\nStrategyQA, but worse on HotpotQA, TriviaQA, and TruthfulQA.\nTable 11: ECE and AUROC metrics for ConfTuner trained on GSM8K and HotpotQA.\nMetric\nMethod\nHotpotQA\nGSM8K\nTriviaQA\nStrategyQA\nTruthfulQA\nAverage\nECE \u2193\nConTuner (GSM8K)\n0.2308\n0.0753\n0.1000\n0.1075\n0.2257\n0.1479\nConTuner (HotpotQA)\n0.0405\n0.1276\n0.0388\n0.1387\n0.1955\n0.1082\nAUROC \u2191\nConTuner (GSM8K)\n0.6552\n0.7035\n0.5978\n0.6826\n0.5822\n0.6408\nConTuner (HotpotQA)\n0.7383\n0.7007\n0.6821\n0.6750\n0.5739\n0.6740\nF\nAdditional Experimental Results\nF.1\nThe Impact of the Hidden States of the Answer\nWe prompt ConfTuner (based on LLaMA) to generate the confidence score prior to providing\nthe answer. The results of AUROC and ECE are presented in Table 12. Our findings indicate\nthat outputting confidence before the answer yields poorer performance compared to outputting it\nafterward, suggesting that the hidden states of the answer tokens are informative about the certainty\nof the response. And ConfTuner still outperforms Base model when outputting confidence first.\nF.2\nComparison between ConfTuner and a classifier\nWe do a precise comparison between (A) ConfTuner, and (B) an LLM with an external linear\nclassifier with the same architecture as the model\u2019s original output projection layer. Specifically, this\nconfidence classifier is a linear transformation layer, whose input dimension matches the dimension\nof the model\u2019s hidden states, and its output dimension equals the size of the model\u2019s vocabulary.

(2) ConfTuner still performs better than the classifier initialized with LLM\u2019s\noriginal embedding matrix (C). This is because the classifier infers only based on the hidden state of\nthe LLM. If the final hidden state does not capture sufficient information about the model\u2019s confidence,\nthe classifier will be less effective at confidence estimation. In contrast, ConfTuner trains the LLM\nitself\u2019s parameters, so the LLM can be trained to preserve the necessary confidence information in\nthe final hidden state.\nTable 13: Comparison between ConfTuner, a classifier with random initialization, and a classifier\ninitialized with LLM\u2019s original embedding matrix.\nMetric\nMethod\nHotpotQA\nGSM8K\nTriviaQA\nStrategyQA\nTruthfulQA\nAverage\nAUROC \u2191\nConTuner (A)\n0.7383\n0.7007\n0.6821\n0.6750\n0.5739\n0.6740\nclassifier+random init (B)\n0.6817\n0.6025\n0.6442\n0.5961\n0.5428\n0.6335\nclassifier+llm init (C)\n0.7356\n0.6518\n0.6873\n0.6420\n0.5626\n0.6559\nECE \u2193\nConTuner (A)\n0.0405\n0.1276\n0.0388\n0.1387\n0.1955\n0.1082\nclassifier+random init (B)\n0.0865\n0.2983\n0.1582\n0.2057\n0.2493\n0.1996\nclassifier+llm init (C)\n0.0581\n0.1685\n0.0621\n0.1459\n0.2206\n0.1310\nF.3\nAccuracy Comparison\nTable 14 presents the experimental accuracies for the 0%-100% confidence assessments, while\nTable 15 details the accuracies for classifications of high, low, or medium confidence.

Recent studies demonstrate that training LLMs on math-\nematical data enhances this capacity [3, 15, 16]. However, with\nconventional mathematical corpora (e.g., web pages and textbooks)\nbecoming progressively depleted, current approaches increasingly\nrely on either manual annotation [18] or more advanced LLMs\nto acquire consumable training data [5, 13, 17, 20]. Despite their\neffectiveness, these approaches face significant challenges in cost\nand quality, posing non-negligible risks to LLM development: (1)\nManual annotation necessitates high-caliber annotators and incurs\nsubstantial costs when handling complex problem sets; (2) Existing\nLLM-synthesized corpora frequently exhibit unreliable correctness,\nwith our random sampling revealing a 40% error rate in existing\nsynthetic datasets. Though such data may temporarily boost model\nperformance, these quality issues undermine the long-term, sus-\ntainable enhancement of this capability.\nIn this work, we aim to construct a scalable data synthesis\npipeline to generate high-quality mathematical data with ensured\ndiversity, complexity, and correctness for training LLMs. Our core\napproach leverages a systematic mathematical knowledge frame-\nwork and mathematical tools to guarantee data quality through\nbilateral verification mechanisms. Unlike prior approaches that\nintegrate tools or use program-of-thought paradigms, our frame-\nwork leverages mathematical tools not to enhance models\u2019 tool-\ninvocation capabilities, but to systematically generate natural lan-\nguage corpora for improving the mathematical reasoning abilities.\narXiv:2508.18824v1  [cs.CL]  26 Aug 2025\n\nCIKM \u201925, November 10\u201314, 2025, Seoul, Republic of Korea\nChen and Tian, et al.\nHowever, synthesizing high-quality mathematical corpora poses\nmultifaceted challenges: (1) Diversity and Systematic Coverage:\nTraditional methods relying on web corpora or benchmark-driven\nsynthesis often overfit existing data distributions, failing to ensure\nboth systematic coverage and sufficient diversity. (2) Complexity-\nCorrectness Tradeoff: While generating complex mathematical\nproblems is crucial, increased problem complexity inherently ampli-\nfies unreliability in generated outputs and verification challenges.\nTo address these dilemmas, we propose a novel program-assisted\ngeneration approach that leverages executable programs to produce\nhigh-quality mathematical data. For systematicity and diversity, we\nfirst construct a three-tier mathematical knowledge system (\u201cedu-\ncation stage, subject, topic\u201d) and associate each knowledge topic\nwith mathematical tools. Through the combinatorial integration\nof knowledge topics and their corresponding tools, we generate\nexecutable programs that comprehensively cover the knowledge\nsystem. These programs are then combined with those derived\nfrom seed corpora to form a systematic and diverse collection of\nmath programs. To balance complexity and correctness, we employ\nfour mutation strategies (constraint, variable, constant, and code\nvariations) on a mathematical program set, enhancing complex-\nity and quantity. The mutated programs are translated back into\nnatural language questions with corresponding solutions. Next,\na bilateral validation mechanism ensures synthesis quality: LLM-\ngenerated solutions are verified against program execution outputs,\neffectively eliminating errors from the generation pipeline and en-\nsuring program-problem consistency. Using our approach, AMD,\nwe synthesized over 12 million high-quality mathematical data\nsamples. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs\nwith our data significantly enhances their reasoning abilities, often\nsurpassing state-of-the-art methods on various evaluation datasets.\nOur contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We explore a\nnovel mathematical data synthesis paradigm that leverages exter-\nnal tools to ensure the complexity and correctness of the synthetic\ncorpus. (2) We construct a comprehensive mathematical knowledge\nsystem and a corresponding mathematical toolkit to enable system-\natic synthesis of math reasoning data. (3) We develop a scalable syn-\nthesis approach that simultaneously considers diversity, complexity,\nand correctness, generating over 12 million high-quality mathe-\nmatical reasoning samples. (4) Extensive experiments demonstrate\nboth the effectiveness of our synthetic data and the superiority of\nour synthesis approach over conventional approaches.\n2\nApproach\nDifferent from tool-integrated LLM approaches [5, 21], we focus on\nsynthesizing a correctness-guaranteed math corpus to enhance the\nLLM\u2019s intrinsic mathematical reasoning, rather than its function-\ncalling abilities. As shown in Fig. 1, we first construct a knowledge\nsystem that maps mathematical concepts to tools. These tools are\nintegrated into executable programs, forming a diverse program\nset along with those derived from a seed mathematics corpus. We\nthen mutate these programs to generate more complex variations\nand translate them into natural language questions. Finally, we\nsolve these questions using LLMs and conduct bilateral verification\nbetween the LLM-generated solutions and the program execution\nresults to filter out a correctness-guaranteed corpus.\nFormally, our goal can be summarized as: Based on a compre-\nhensive mathematical knowledge system K and seed questions S, we\nconstruct a diverse and complex set of math programs C = {\ud835\udc50}. From\nthis, we create a correctness-guaranteed math corpus D = {(\ud835\udc50,\ud835\udc5e,\ud835\udc4e)},\nwhere \ud835\udc50is a synthetic math program, \ud835\udc5eand \ud835\udc4eare the corresponding\nmath question and solution, respectively.\n2.1\nKnowledge System-driven Mathematical\nPrograms Synthesis.\nTo construct the knowledge system, we integrate two foundational\nresources: K-12 mathematics textbooks and the mathematical tax-\nonomy from the Chinese Library Classification System. We then\nexploit the integration capabilities of GPT-4 as well as the knowl-\nedge of human experts to develop a comprehensive knowledge\nsystem. As a result, our knowledge system K organizes more than\n250 key topics in mathematics into a three-tier hierarchy of educa-\ntion stage, subject and topic (such as College \u2192Linear Algebra \u2192\nEigenvalues), ensuring curricular alignment and academic rigor.\nConstructing Systematic Mathematical Toolkit. Building upon\nthe knowledge system K, we create an automated pipeline to map\nmathematical topics to tools. For each topic \ud835\udc58\u2208K, we select 10-50\nrepresentative problems from curricular materials and open-source\nmath corpora. GPT-4 generates programs to solve these problems\nusing scientific computing libraries (e.g., SymPy), ensuring standard\nAPI usage and step-by-step derivations. We then extract the related\nAPIs, {\ud835\udc61}\ud835\udc58, from these programs through syntax pattern mining,\nestablishing a mapping from topic \ud835\udc58to tools {\ud835\udc61}\ud835\udc58. Finally, we ag-\ngregate the related APIs from all knowledge topics to obtain the\ntool set T = \u00d0\n\ud835\udc58\u2208K{\ud835\udc61}\ud835\udc58, where T consists of over 100 APIs. These\nAPIs form a Mathematical Toolkit, organized by Topic (e.g., Matrix\nDiagonalization) and Atomic Operation (e.g., numpy.linalg.qr),\nbridging the knowledge system with computational practice.\nSynthesizing Programs via Tool Combinations. Inspired by\n\u201cSentence Building Games\u201d, we combine tools from different math\ntopics in K to construct executable programs. Specifically, each\ngeneration process begins by sampling 1-3 mathematical topics\nfrom our structured knowledge system K through stratified random\nsampling, forming a topic combination (\ud835\udc581,\ud835\udc582, ...), which maintains\ncurriculum coherence through constraint-based selection. Each\ntopic \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc56is then mapped to its corresponding code tools through\nour toolkit, generating a tool combination (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc581,\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc582, ...). Finally, the\nprogram generator LLM\ud835\udc43uses the topic and tool combinations, along\nwith a prompt, to generate a program as follows:\nC\ud835\udc3e=\n\u00d8\n(\ud835\udc581,...)\u223cK\nLLM\ud835\udc43((\ud835\udc581, ...), (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc581, ...), \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5d)\nwhere C\ud835\udc3eare programs generated from our knowledge system\nand \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5dis the program generation prompt. Additionally, to enhance\nreal-world relevance, we sample about 100 thousand problems from\nstandard benchmarks to form a seed question set S. These problems\nare solved using programs to generate an additional program set:\nC\ud835\udc46=\n\u00d8\n\ud835\udc5e\u2032\u2208\u02c6S\nLLM\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc5e\u2032, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5d\u2032),\nwhere \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5d\u2032 denotes the program solution generation prompt.By\nmerging the above program sets, the final program set C = C\ud835\udc3e\u222aC\ud835\udc46\n\nArrows of Math Reasoning Data Synthesis for Large Language Models: Diversity, Complexity and Correctness\nCIKM \u201925, November 10\u201314, 2025, Seoul, Republic of Korea\nQuestion\nOutput\nCorrectness-Guaranteed \nMathematical Corpus Synthesis\nDiverse Math Programs\nAccurate Math Corpus\nAnswer\nQuestion\nAnswer &\nVerification\nQuestion \nBacktranslation \nQuestion \nSolving \nProgram \nExecution\nProgram Mutating \nDriven by LLMs\nDriven by the Python Compiler\nKnowledge System-Driven \nMathematical Programs Synthesis \nMath Knowledge System\nGrade\nMiddle\nHigh\nCollege\nKnowledge Point Mix\nMath Seed Corpus\nConvert Question \nto Program\nConvert Tools Mix \nto Program\n\u2026\nTools Mix\nDerived from Seed Corpus\nDerived from Knowledge System\n\u2026\nMATH\n\u2026\n\u2026\nWEB\nFigure 1: The pipeline of our approach. We first develop a mathematical knowledge system mapping concepts to tools, then\nsynthesize diverse math programs by integrating these tools with a seed corpus. Next, these programs are mutated for increased\ncomplexity and translated into natural language questions. Finally, an LLM generates solutions using Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\nreasoning, which are then verified against program execution results for correctness.\nis a diverse collection that fulfills two key objectives: 1) systematic\ncoverage through knowledge graph traversal, 2) empirical ground-\ning via real-world problem distribution matching.\n2.2\nProgram-driven Mathematical Corpus\nSynthesis.\nInstead of augmenting data directly, we first enhance program\ncomplexity through mutation and then translate these programs\ninto new question-solution pairs. The correctness of these pairs\nis then ensured through bilateral validation, comparing program\nexecution results against the LLM-generated solutions.\nMutating Programs for Greater Complexity. Our synthesized\nprogram set C combines two generation sources (the knowledge\nsystem and seed questions) to ensure both systematic coverage and\ndiversity. However, empirical result reveals inherent limitations in\ndirect LLM-generated programs C = {\ud835\udc50}, which often suffer from\noversimplification and insufficient quantity. To overcome these\nlimitations, we develop a mutation strategy with four specialized\noperators: 1) Constraint Mutation: deepens problem complexity\nby adding/modifying constraints (e.g., \u201c0 < \ud835\udc65\u201d \u2192\u201c0 < \ud835\udc65< 5\u201d).\n2) Variable Mutation: introduces new variables or substitutes\nexisting ones (e.g., linear \u2192multivariate equations). 3) Constant\nMutation: perturbs numerical constants or reformat expressions\n(e.g., 10% to 300%). 4) Code Mutation: inserts control structures or\nreplaces API calls. Formally, our mutation model LLM\ud835\udc40processes\neach program \ud835\udc50\u2208C through \ud835\udc58iterative refinements:\nC\ud835\udc40=\n\u00d8\n\ud835\udc50\u2208C\n\ud835\udc58\u00d8\n\ud835\udc5a=1\nLLM\ud835\udc40(\ud835\udc50, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5a)\nwhere \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5adenotes mutation templates guiding specific complex-\nity enhancements. Finally, we combine the original and mutated\nprograms to form the final program set bC = C \u222aC\ud835\udc40, which not\nonly ensures the diversity of the programs but also significantly\nenhances their complexity and quantity.\nGuaranteeing Correctness via Bilateral Verification. The pro-\ngrams in C can be translated back into question-solution pairs,\nconstructing a mathematical corpus in natural language. However,\nthis strategy raises challenges from two aspects: 1) Consistency: the\nreverse-engineered natural language problem should align with the\ncode. 2) Validity: the problem should be clearly defined and solvable.\nDue to the current limitations of LLMs, these issues cannot be fully\nresolved. Moreover, our mutation strategy for mathematical pro-\ngrams exacerbates these challenges, leading to unreliable synthetic\ndata. To address this, we adopt a bilateral verification mechanism to\nensure the correctness of the synthesized data, i.e., execute the pro-\ngrams and compare the outputs with the LLM-generated solutions.\nOur verification mechanism operates through three core steps for\neach program \ud835\udc50\u2208C: (1) Question Generation: produce question\n\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc50via LLMs, i.e., \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc50= LLM\ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc50, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5e). (2) Answer Extraction: derive\nanswers through dual channels:\n\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc50= LLM\ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc50, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc60)\n\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50= regex_extract(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc50)\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc50= Interpreter(\ud835\udc50).\nIn practice, we sample multiple solutions for each question to scale\nthe quantity of data. (3) Cross-Verification: construct verified\ncorpus: D = {(\ud835\udc50,\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc50,\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc50) | \ud835\udc50\u2208bC \u2227\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\u2261\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc50}. Note that errors at\nany step from \u201c\ud835\udc50\u2192\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc50\u2192\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc50\u2192\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\u201d can lead to inconsistencies\nbetween \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50and \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc50. Thus, our two-sided verification mechanism\nnot only ensures the correctness of semantic translation (code \u2192\nquestion) and logical derivation (question \u2192solution). This process\nultimately results in a correctness-guaranteed math corpus D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n\nCIKM \u201925, November 10\u201314, 2025, Seoul, Republic of Korea\nChen and Tian, et al.\nTable 1: Performance comparison among our method and\nother mathematical data synthesis methods.\nBase\nModels\nGSM8K\nMATH\nMinerva\nSVAMP\nLLaMA3-8B\n-\n55.5\n17.3\n18.2\n69.1\nMathGenie\n23.7\n19.1\n17.8\n30.5\nAMD\n58.5\n23.5\n19.2\n76.1\nMistral-7B\n-\n39.8\n11.8\n11.4\n63.9\nMathGenie\n45.8\n14.5\n13.6\n71.3\nAMD\n45.7\n16.6\n18.2\n71.6\nDeepseek-Math-7b\n/\n63.7\n32.3\n29.4\n74.0\nMathGenie\n66.9\n34.9\n30.6\n82.8\nAMD\n66.6\n37.7\n32.6\n80.8\n2.3\nFine-tuning using Synthetic Data\nOur pipeline produces 12.3 million program-question-solution triples,\nwith 2.6 million derived from the knowledge system and 9.7 million\nfrom seed corpus expansion. Among these samples, there are 1.8\nmillion unique program-question pairs, averaging about 6.8 solu-\ntions per pair. Following established methodologies, we filter out\ninstances with 10-gram overlaps in both inputs and outputs from\nthe test sets of downstream evaluation tasks. The filtered synthesis\ndata are then used to fine-tune open-source LLMs, enabling them\nto predict solutions based on the given problems.\n3\nExperiments\n3.1\nExperimental Settings\nWe follow existing work [10], applying LoRA to perform supervised\nfine-tuning on three pre-trained models: LLaMA3-8B [6], Mistral-\n7B [8], and Deepseek-Math-7B [15]. To evaluate the effectiveness\nof AMD, we assess the accuracy before and after fine-tuning on\nfour benchmarks: GSM8K [4], MATH [7], Minerva_Math [9], and\nSVAMP [14]. We use existing mathematical data synthesis methods,\nMathGenie [12], as comparative methods. To ensure a fair evalua-\ntion of data quality, we randomly sample 50,000 instances from the\npublicly available training datasets of each method for fine-tuning.\n3.2\nOverall Performance\nTable 1 presents a comprehensive performance comparison between\nAMD and the baseline mathematical data synthesis approach across\nthree base models and four mathematical reasoning benchmarks.\nThe results demonstrate that AMD consistently outperforms Math-\nGenie in most settings, particularly showing significant gains on\nweaker base models like LLaMA3-8B. While MathGenie occasion-\nally achieves marginal advantages in specific configurations, AMD\nexhibits more robust performance across different model architec-\ntures and task domains. The consistent superior performance across\nheterogeneous evaluation metrics confirms AMD\u2019s effectiveness in\ngenerating high-quality mathematical training data.\n3.3\nAblation Study\nThe ablation studies of two data synthesis pathways and two lan-\nguages are shown in Table 2 and Table 3. When combining knowl-\nedge system-derived data and seed corpus expansion, all models\nachieve optimal or near-optimal performance across benchmarks.\nThe ablation study of different languages shows that our method\nis effective in both Chinese and English, and combining data from\nboth languages will not reduce the performance of the model.\nTable 2: Ablation study of our data derived from the knowl-\nedge system/seed corpus.\nBase\nKnowledge\nSystem\nSeed\nCorpus\nGSM8K\nMATH\nMinerva\nSVAMP\nLLaMA3-8B\n\u2713\n\u2713\n58.5\n23.5\n19.2\n76.1\n\u2713\n56.1\n23.1\n19.2\n76.5\n\u2713\n57.8\n23.1\n19.0\n77.8\nMistral-7B\n\u2713\n\u2713\n45.7\n16.6\n18.2\n71.6\n\u2713\n45.3\n16.2\n17.8\n70.1\n\u2713\n46.1\n16.8\n17.8\n69.1\nDeepseek-Math-7B\n\u2713\n\u2713\n66.6\n37.7\n32.6\n80.8\n\u2713\n66.3\n38.3\n32.6\n79.9\n\u2713\n68.1\n38.1\n35.4\n78.6\nTable 3: Ablation study of our data with different languages.\nBase\nEN\nCN\nGSM8K\nMATH\nMinerva\nSVAMP\nLLaMA3-8B\n\u2713\n\u2713\n58.5\n23.5\n19.2\n76.1\n\u2713\n56.1\n23.2\n17.6\n75.5\n\u2713\n57.8\n22.0\n20.2\n76.5\nMistral-7B\n\u2713\n\u2713\n45.7\n16.6\n18.2\n71.6\n\u2713\n45.3\n15.4\n17.8\n69.2\n\u2713\n45.5\n16.7\n19.6\n69.6\nDeepseek-Math-7B\n\u2713\n\u2713\n66.6\n37.7\n32.6\n80.8\n\u2713\n66.3\n37.8\n34.0\n79.8\n\u2713\n67.7\n38.2\n33.4\n79.7\n4\nRelated Work\nLarge language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable ca-\npabilities in many fields [1, 16, 22], but their performance in math-\nematical reasoning remains inconsistent [2, 11]. To improve their\nperformance on mathematical reasoning, current methods often\nemploy chain of thoughts (CoT) hints on general models [19], or\nenhance models by pre-training or fine-tuning with specialized\nmathematical datasets to improve their performance [3, 15]. How-\never, the large amount of mathematical data required by these\nmethods is difficult to collect manually, so there has been a surge in\nmethods for automatically synthesizing high-quality mathematical\ndatasets in recent years. Jiuzhang [23] creates a knowledge distil-\nlation dataset to train a small LLM for generating mathematical\ncontent. MathGenie [12] generates mathematical problems with\ncorresponding codes to verify the correctness of the solutions, but\nit lacks diversity because its data is not combined and developed\nfrom a mathematical perspective. Neuro-Symbolic Data Genera-\ntion [10] introduces a symbolic system to convert and mutate the\noriginal text into new symbolic problems, enhancing the diversity\nof the problems with correctness by verifying the solutions with\ntheir symbolic representation. However, its mutation methods are\nconfined to some pre-defined patterns, limiting the complexity of\nthe generated content.\n5\nConclusion\nIn this work, we propose a novel mathematical data synthesis para-\ndigm, build a comprehensive mathematical knowledge system and\na corresponding mathematical toolkit. We implement knowledge\nsystem-driven mathematical program synthesis and correctness-\nguaranteed mathematical corpus synthesis, replacing traditional\ncorpus synthesis that completely relies on LLMs with external tool\ngeneration that considers diversity, complexity, and correctness. Ex-\nperiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our synthetic data\nand that our synthesis method is superior to traditional methods.\n\nArrows of Math Reasoning Data Synthesis for Large Language Models: Diversity, Complexity and Correctness\nCIKM \u201925, November 10\u201314, 2025, Seoul, Republic of Korea\nReferences\n[1] Josh Achiam, Steven Adler, Sandhini Agarwal, Lama Ahmad, Ilge Akkaya, Floren-\ncia Leoni Aleman, Diogo Almeida, Janko Altenschmidt, Sam Altman, Shyamal\nAnadkat, et al. 2023.

Existing approaches of-\nten struggle with capturing long-range dependencies, com-\nplex semantic relations, and the social dynamics influenc-\ning news dissemination. Furthermore, these methods re-\nquire extensive labelled datasets, making their deployment\nresource-intensive. In this study, we propose a novel self-\nsupervised misinformation detection framework that inte-\ngrates both complex semantic relations using Abstract Mean-\ning Representation (AMR) and news propagation dynamics.\nWe introduce an LLM-based graph contrastive loss (LGCL)\nthat utilizes negative anchor points generated by a Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) to enhance feature separability in a\nzero-shot manner. To incorporate social context, we employ\na multi view graph masked autoencoder, which learns news\npropagation features from social context graph. By combin-\ning these semantic and propagation-based features, our ap-\nproach effectively differentiates between fake and real news\nin a self-supervised manner. Extensive experiments demon-\nstrate that our self-supervised framework achieves superior\nperformance compared to other state-of-the-art methodolo-\ngies, even with limited labelled datasets while improving gen-\neralizability.\nIntroduction\nThe spread of misinformation has become a significant prob-\nlem in the digital age. It can lead to social unrest, foster ha-\ntred, erode trust, and ultimately impede the overall progress\nand stability of the society (Dewatana and Adillah 2021).\nHence, effectively detecting misinformation has become an\nessential challenge to solve.\nThe concept of the \u201cveracity problem on the web\u201d was\nfirst introduced by (Yin, Han, and Yu 2008) by designing\na solution called TruthFinder. This method verified news\ncontent by cross-referencing it with information from rep-\nutable websites. Later, (Feng, Banerjee, and Choi 2012) em-\nployed manually crafted textual features for detecting mis-\ninformation. However, manually crafted features are time-\nconsuming to create and fail to capture the complex se-\nmantic relations present in the text. Subsequently, many\nresearchers turned to more advanced techniques, utilizing\n*These authors contributed equally.\nCopyright \u00a9 2026, Association for the Advancement of Artificial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org).

For example, RNNs\nare employed to capture local and temporal dependencies\nwithin text data (Ma et al. 2016a; Li et al. 2022) and BERT\nhas been increasingly utilized to improve the comprehen-\nsion of contextual relationships in news articles (Devlin et al.\n2019). Key limitations of these approaches are their struggle\nto maintain longer text dependencies and they do not capture\ncomplex semantic relations, such as events, locations, and\ntrigger words. (Gupta, Rajora, and Kundu 2025) solves this\nproblem but requires supervision. Additionally, these mod-\nels often neglect the social context and dynamics that influ-\nence news propagation (Yuan et al. 2019). Acknowledging\nthis, researchers have introduced graph-based approaches\nthat integrate social context into the detection process (Min\net al. 2022; Sun et al. 2022; Li et al. 2024). Despite their\neffectiveness, these methods rely heavily on large, labelled\ndatasets for training. Collecting and annotating such exten-\nsive datasets is time-consuming and resource-intensive, lim-\niting their practical implementation. To address this (Yin\net al. 2024) propose a model to generate unsupervised fea-\ntures from the social context graph but do not consider the\nsemantic relationship within the text. Therefore, we require\na model that is capable of incorporating semantic text fea-\ntures, a social context propagation graph and also perform\narXiv:2508.18819v1  [cs.CL]  26 Aug 2025\n\nwell with minimal labelled data as highlighted in Table 1.\nThis paper proposes a novel self-supervised misinforma-\ntion detection methodology that considers complex semantic\nrelations among entities in the news and the propagation of\nthe news as a social context graph. In order to identify the se-\nmantic relations, this method incorporates a self-supervised\nAbstract Meaning Representation (AMR) encoder using the\nproposed graph contrastive loss. This loss creates feature\nseparation by sampling negative anchor points using LLM.\nThe use of negative anchor points from LLM helps in in-\ncreasing the separation between fake and real classes in the\nlatent space. In order to integrate the social context and cap-\nture the propagation of the news, our methodology also in-\ntegrates a multi-view Graph Masked Autoencoder that em-\nploys the context and content of the news propagation pro-\ncess as the self-supervised signal to enhance the final fea-\nture space. These features, even with limited labelled data,\nachieve performance comparable or better than supervised\ncounterparts using a simple linear SVM layer. The key con-\ntributions of our research are as follows:\n\u2022 A novel self-supervised learning based on AMR and so-\ncial context graph is introduced in order to validate the\nveracity of news articles, eliminating dependence on la-\nbelled data.\n\u2022 In order to segregate the feature space among real and\nfake classes, graph contrastive loss is proposed. An\nLLM-based negative sampler is designed to handle neg-\natives in the loss.\n\u2022 To capture the social context and propagation feature of\nthe news, we propose an augmentation-based multi-view\nmasked graph autoencoder module.\n\u2022 Comprehensive evaluation with SOTA methods, demon-\nstrating its superior performance.\nRelated Work\nIn this section, we provide a concise overview of the ap-\nproaches utilized for detecting misinformation. The rele-\nvant studies are categorized into two main components:\nmisinformation detection and self-supervised graph learning\nmethodologies.\nMisinformation Detection Methods\nEarly research on misinformation detection focused on man-\nually crafted linguistic features (Feng, Banerjee, and Choi\n2012; Ma et al. 2016b; Long et al. 2017), requiring sig-\nnificant effort for evaluation. EANN (Wang et al. 2018) is\nproposed to effectively extract event-invariant features from\nmultimedia content, thereby enhancing the detection of mis-\ninformation on newly arrived events. In this line of work,\nrecently, FakeFlow (Ghanem et al. 2021) classified news us-\ning lexical features and affective information. In a separate\nline of work, external knowledge was integrated to improve\nmodel performance. Different source of external knowledge\nwas used. For example, Popat et al. (Popat et al. 2017) re-\ntrieved external articles to model interactions; KAN (Dun\net al. 2021) and CompareNet (Hu et al. 2021) leveraged\nWikidata for domain expansion, while KGML (Yao et al.\n2021) bridged meta-training and meta-testing using knowl-\nedge bases. Further, researchers have developed graph-based\nmethods that incorporate social context into the detection\nprocess, for example, authors of GTUT (Gangireddy et al.\n2020) construct a graph for initial fake news spreader iden-\ntification, (UMD)2 (Silva et al. 2024) considers user credi-\nbility and propagation speed, GACL (Sun et al. 2022) con-\nstructs a tree of tweets for contrastive learning. All these\nmethods do not leverage the complete propagation graph,\nand GACL requires supervision. Other graph-based meth-\nods like (Min et al. 2022; Li et al. 2024) rely heavily on\nmanual annotation and external data.\nRecently, Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR)-\nbased methods emerged to mitigate long-text dependency.\nAbstract Meaning Representation (AMR), as introduced\nby (Banarescu et al. 2013), captures relationships between\nnodes using PropBank framesets. Recently, Zhang et al.\n(Zhang et al. 2023) utilized AMR to detect out-of-context\nmultimodal misinformation by identifying discrepancies be-\ntween textual and visual data. In (Gupta et al. 2023), authors\nencoded textual information using AMR and explored how\nits semantic relations influence the veracity assessment of\nnews. However, this study lacked sufficient evidence or jus-\ntification for entity relationships within the AMR graph. Fur-\nther, in the integration of evidence in AMR, EA2N (Gupta,\nRajora, and Kundu 2025) is proposed that effectively cap-\ntures evidence among entities present in AMR. All of these\napproaches rely on supervised data for AMR training and\nhave not explored the potential of unsupervised methods.\nSelf-Supervised Graph Learning\nSelf-supervised graph learning harnesses the structured rich-\nness of graph data to derive meaningful representations\nwithout relying on explicit labels (Wu et al. 2023). A Graph\nAuto-Encoder (GAE) based model proposed that learns low-\ndimensional graph representations (Kipf and Welling 2016).\nLater studies improved GAEs by focusing on reconstruct-\ning masked node features to enhance self-supervised learn-\ning for classification (Hou et al. 2022). Further, (Hou et al.\n2023) improved the performance by introducing multi-view\nrandom remasking. Recently, an unsupervised method for\ndetecting misinformation GAMC (Yin et al. 2024) has been\nproposed by leveraging both the context and content of news\npropagation as self-supervised signals. However, GAMC\ndoes not effectively handle complex semantic relations for\nlonger text dependencies.\nMethodology\nThe overall methodology is presented in Figure 1. In this\nsection we present these in more detail.\nSelf-supervised AMR Graph Learning\nGiven an input text T, we first create the AMR graph\nGamr(Vamr, Eamr) capturing the relationships between dif-\nferent entities. AMR generation process involves parsing the\nsentences to extract linguistic information, including seman-\ntic roles, relations, and core events.

Gamr is then linked to\nexternal evidences from Wikipedia represented as GW ikiAMR. This GW ikiAMR graph is then converted to latent space features\nHGamr by the graph transformer E\u03b4 based on Llgcl optimization. The propagation graph of the same news article is then\nextracted and multiple augmentations are created. These augmented graphs are then passed to our multi-view remasked graph\nautoencoder which is optimized using Lprop. The propagation graph feature HGprop for each news is extracted from the trained\nGNN encoder. The final features for misinformation classification are obtained by concatenating HGamr and HGprop.\nevidence by using the Evidence Linking Algorithm (ELA)\nused in (Gupta, Rajora, and Kundu 2025). The graph af-\nter applying ELA is referred to as WikiAMR, represented\nas GW ikiAMR. In the paper, authors have shown the impor-\ntance of WikiAMR over AMR. WikiAMR comprises inter-\nconnected undirected paths between entity nodes in Gamr\ngenerated from the text. The WikiAMR representation helps\nto distinguish the difference between real and fake articles.\nAMR Graph Learning with Path Optimization:\nThis\nmodule plays an important role in extracting meaningful fea-\ntures from the given WikiAMR graph. Features extracted\nhere capture essential semantic relationships, enabling a\ndeeper understanding of the underlying textual data. At the\ncore of this module is a Graph Transformer (Cai and Lam\n2020), which employs various attention mechanisms to ef-\nfectively process the graph representation. This allows the\nmodel to reason about and learn from the text more compre-\nhensively.\nThe WikiAMR graph is first passed through a node ini-\ntialization and relation encoder to transform it into a repre-\nsentation in Rn\u00d7k\u00d7d, where n, k, and d denote the batch\nsize, maximum sequence length, and the dimensionality of\nthe graph encoding, respectively. To facilitate the model in\nidentifying specific paths within GW ikiAMR, the relation en-\ncoder computes the shortest path between two entities. This\nsequence of the path is subsequently converted into a rela-\ntion vector using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based RNN\n(Cho et al. 2014). qt is the sequence encoding extracted from\nGRU to get the relation vector ruv. The mathematical formu-\nlation for this encoding is given by:\n\u2212\u2192q t = GRUf(\u2212\u2192q t\u22121, spt)\n\u2190\u2212q t = GRUb(\u2190\u2212q t+1, spt)\nHere, spt represents the shortest path between two\nentities. Formally, the shortest relation path spi\u2192j =\n[e(u, k1), e(k1, k2), . . . , e(kn, v)] between the node u and\nthe node v, where e(\u00b7, \u00b7) indicates the edge label and k1:n are\nthe relay nodes. To compute the attention scores, the final re-\nlational encoding ruv is split into two distinct components,\nru\u2192v and rv\u2192u, via a linear transformation with a parameter\nmatrix Wr:\nruv = [\u2212\u2192q n; \u2190\u2212q 0],\n[ru\u2192v; rv\u2192u] = Wrruv\nSubsequently, attention scores \u03b2uv are calculated by in-\ncorporating both entity and relation representations from the\ngraph GW ikiAMR:\n\u03b2uv = h(eu, ev, ruv)\n= (eu + ru\u2192v)W \u22a4\np Wk(ev + rv\u2192u)\n= euW \u22a4\np Wkev\n|\n{z\n}\na\n+ euW \u22a4\np Wkrv\u2192u\n|\n{z\n}\nb\n+ ru\u2192vW \u22a4\np Wkev\n|\n{z\n}\nc\n+ ru\u2192vW \u22a4\np Wkrv\u2192u\n|\n{z\n}\nd\n(1)\n\nThe attention weights computed here guide the focus on\nentities according to their relationships. Each term in Equa-\ntion 1 serves a distinct purpose: (a) models content-based\nattention, (b) captures biases related to the source of the re-\nlationship, (c) addresses biases from the target, and (d) en-\ncodes a general relational bias, providing a comprehensive\nview of entity interactions. Finally, the Graph Transformer\n(E\u03b4) encodes GW ikiAMR, producing the final graph repre-\nsentation as follows:\nHGamr = E\u03b4(GW ikiAMR) \u2208Rn\u00d7k\u00d7d\n(2)\nHere, HGamr represents the output graph embeddings\ngenerated by the Graph Transformer, and d is the feature\ndimensionality.\nGraph Contrastive Loss:\nOur proposed LLM-based\ngraph contrastive loss (LGCL) function comprises two pri-\nmary objectives. The first objective aims to ensure that the\ngraph embedding remains close to its original embedding\nspace by minimizing the reconstruction error between the\npredicted feature and the original feature. The second objec-\ntive seeks to maximize the divergence between the predicted\nfeature and the negative sample feature. To quantify the sim-\nilarity between features, we utilize the Scaled Cosine Error\n(SCE) (Hou et al. 2022). Formally, given the original feature\nY and the reconstructed output Y \u2032, SCE is defined as:\nLSCE =\n1\n|N|\nX\nn\u2208N\n\u0012\n1 \u2212\nyT\ni y\u2032\ni\n\u2225yi\u2225\u00b7 \u2225y\u2032\ni\u2225\n\u0013\u03b3\n,\n\u03b3 \u22651\n(3)\nHere, \u03b3 is a scaling factor. When predictions have high con-\nfidence, the resulting cosine errors are generally less than 1\nand diminish more quickly towards zero as the scaling factor\n\u03b3 > 1.\nThe contrastive loss requires both a positive sample fea-\nture ypos and a negative sample feature yneg to compare\nagainst the predicted feature. In the proposed formulation,\nHGamr is used as y\u2032, ypos is the original BERT-derived fea-\nture of the input text, while yneg is a negative sample fea-\nture generated using an LLM-based negative sampler. The\nfinal contrastive loss for graph-based self-supervised learn-\ning (SSL) is formulated as follows:\nLlgcl =LSCE(y\u2032, ypos)\n+ \u03bb \u00b7 max (0, m \u2212LSCE(y\u2032, yneg))\n(4)\nHere, \u03bb is a weighting factor, and m is the margin to ensure\nnegatives are pushed apart in cosine space.\nLLM-based Negative Sampler:\nWe employ a large lan-\nguage model (LLM) in zero-shot to facilitate effective con-\ntrastive learning. Specifically, LLaMA3-7B is used to gener-\nate negative samples (yneg). This approach leverages the rea-\nsoning capabilities of the LLM to distinguish between real\nand fake input samples, assigning them pseudo labels for the\nselection of the negative feature for the contrastive learning\ntask.\nLet X = {x1, x2, . . . , xn} denote the set of input fea-\ntures. The input prompt and output format used for the\nLLM is mentioned in the end of the section. For each in-\nput xi \u2208X, the LLM assigns a pseudo label eyi \u2208{0, 1},\nwhere:\neyi =\n\u001a1\nif xi is labelled as real,\n0\nif xi is labelled as fake.\nUsing the LLM\u2019s output labels, we partition the input\nsamples into two groups:\nXreal = {xi | eyi = 1},\nXfake = {xi | eyi = 0}.\nWe compute the centroids of the real and fake samples as,\ncreal =\n1\n|Xreal|\nX\nxi\u2208Xreal\nfi,\ncfake =\n1\n|Xfake|\nX\nxi\u2208Xfake\nfi.\nwhere a feature vector fi \u2208Rn\u00d7k\u00d7d is the initial BERT fea-\nture corresponding to xi. The negative sample (yneg) is cho-\nsen to maximize the contrastive loss. In particular, we use\ncfake as the representative negative sample for the real input\nsample, while creal is used as the negative sample for the fake\ninput sample. By leveraging the LLM to reason over input\nsamples and compute these centroids, our approach effec-\ntively selects meaningful negative samples, enhancing the\ndiscriminative power of the contrastive learning model.\nLLM\u2019s Zero Shot Input Prompt:\nWrite in one word among \u2018real\u2019 or \u2018fake\u2019 whether given\ntext is real or fake. {text}\nLLM\u2019s Output: fake/real\nMulti-View Social Context and Propagation Graph\nLearning\nEach news article is converted into a propagation graph\nGprop = (V, E, F) as in (Dou et al. 2021). Nodes in V\nrepresent one news article and users who forward that arti-\ncle. An edge in E exists between two nodes if there exists a\nforwarding relationship between them. The features for the\nnews node are generated by passing the news article to a\npre-trained language model (BERT), and the features for the\nuser nodes are generated based on their recent 200 posts.\nThe news and user node features are collectively referred to\nas F.\nGraph Augmentation:\nWe use two augmentation strate-\ngies: 1 feature masking and 2 random edge removal for\ncreating augmentations of the input graph as suggested in\n(Yin et al. 2024). For input feature masking, we randomly\nselect 50% nodes in the graph and replace their features with\na masked token. For 2 , we randomly remove 20% edges\nfrom the graph. Each augmented graph for Gprop is denoted\nas Gprop\ni\n.\nGraph Encoding:\nWe encode each Gprop\ni\ninto a latent\nspace representation using a GNN encoder. For this, we use\nGIN (Xu et al. 2019) represented using Equation 5 as it is\ntheoretically proven to distinguish between graph structures.\nf (k)\nv\n= MLP\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed(1 + \u03f5) \u00b7 f (k\u22121)\nv\n+\nX\nu\u2208N(v)\nf (k\u22121)\nu\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n(5)\n\nHere, f (k)\nv\nis embedding of node v at layer k, N(v) contains\nneighbors of node v and \u03f5 is a learnable scalar controlling\nresidual connections. The final node embeddings from the\nencoder for each Gprop\ni\nis represented as F\nGprop\ni\nenc\n.\nFor downstream classification tasks on Gprop we use the\ngraph embedding HGprop calculated as:\nHGprop =\n1\n|V |\nX\nv\u2208V\nfv \u2208FGprop\nenc\n(6)\nMulti-View Graph Decoding:\nNow, from the encoded\nnode representations F\nGprop\ni\nenc\n, we decode the input node fea-\ntures F using GIN as a decoder. In (Yin et al. 2024) the\nauthors use a single stage remasking for each F\nGprop\ni\nenc\nto re-\nconstruct the input features. But authors in (Hou et al. 2023)\nhave shown that feature reconstruction is susceptible to con-\ngruence among the input features, which single remasking\ncannot address. To address this, we introduce multi-view\nfeature remasking of each augmented graph F\nGprop\ni\nenc\n. Each\nremasked encoded feature is denoted by F\nGprop\ni\nencj . It acts as\na regularizer for the decoder, making it robust against un-\nexpected noises in input and helping to avoid overfitting.\nThe final objective of the decoder is to reconstruct the actual\nnode features F from these masked encoded node features\nusing the multi-view autoencoder loss described next.\nMulti-View Autoencoder Loss:\nGiven k augmentations\nof the input graph Gprop represented as Gprop\n1\n, . . . , Gprop\nk\n,\nand m remasked decoded output for each augmented graph\nrepresented as F\nGprop\n1\ndec1 , . . . , F\nGprop\n1\ndecm , . . . , F\nGprop\nk\ndecm , we define\nthe multi-view reconstruction loss as\nLmrec =\nk\nX\ni=1\nm\nX\nj=1\n(F \u2212F\nGprop\ni\ndecj )\n(7)\nTo minimize the divergence across the views of the decoded\nfeatures, we define the multi-view cosine similarity loss as\nLmcos =\nM\n\u2200l,i,j; if l=l\u2032 then i\u0338=j\nl\u2264k,i\u2264m,j\u2264m\nF\nGprop\nl\ndeci .F\nGprop\nl\u2032\ndecj\n\f\f\f\n\f\f\fF\nGprop\nl\ndeci\n\f\f\f\n\f\f\f.\n\f\f\f\n\f\f\fF\nGprop\nl\u2032\ndecj\n\f\f\f\n\f\f\f\n(8)\nHere, M is the mean operation. Our final propagation loss\nis Lprop = Lmrec + Lmcos.\nFinal Loss\nWe combine the AMR and Propagation loss as L = Llgcl +\nLprop. We train our model using this loss, and the final fea-\ntures of our model are HGamr \u00b7 HGprop. These features are\nthen used for misinformation classification.\nExperiments and Results\nWe perform experiments on the publicly available datasets\nFakeNewsNet (Shu et al. 2020) in order to assess the effec-\ntiveness of the model. This repository contains two separate\nbenchmark datasets, namely, PolitiFact and GossipCop. Fur-\nther details on the datasets and implementation of our model\nare provided in the supplementary document.\nBaselines:\nIn our evaluation, we contrast our model\nwith various state-of-the-art baselines, categorized into two\ngroups. The first group utilizes only unsupervised methods\n(TruthFinder (Yin, Han, and Yu 2008), UFNDA (Li et al.\n2021), UFD (Yang et al. 2022), GTUT (Gangireddy et al.\n2020), (UMD)2 (Silva et al. 2024), GraphMAE (Hou et al.\n2022), GAMC (Yin et al. 2024)), while the second incorpo-\nrates supervised methods (SAFE (Zhou, Wu, and Zafarani\n2020), EANN (Wang et al. 2018), dEFEND (Shu et al.\n2019), GACL (Sun et al. 2022), EA2N (BERT) (Gupta, Ra-\njora, and Kundu 2025)).\nResults\nWe conducted a comparative analysis of our model against\nvarious unsupervised and supervised baselines on the Poli-\ntiFact and GossipCop datasets. As shown in Table 2, our\nmodel achieved the highest accuracy (0.919), precision\n(0.933), recall (0.903), and F1-score (0.918) among the\nunsupervised baselines. Compared to GAMC, the existing\nbenchmark, our model outperforms it by a margin of 8.1%\nin accuracy and 8.7% in F1-score (on the absolute scale).\nAlso, our model surpasses GTUT and (UMD)2 by signifi-\ncant margins, 12 \u223c14% in accuracy and 14 \u223c15% in the\nF1-score, indicating a superior ability to differentiate be-\ntween fake and real news. In a similar context, as shown in\nTable 3, our model significantly outperforms existing unsu-\npervised baselines on the GossipCop dataset. It achieves the\nhighest accuracy (0.968), precision (0.965), recall (0.967),\nand F1-score (0.966), outperforming GAMC, which attained\nan accuracy of 0.946 and an F1-score of 0.943. This repre-\nsents a 2.2% improvement in accuracy and a 2.3% improve-\nment in the F1-score. This improvement can be attributed\nto the proposed model, which leverages a combination of\nself-supervised AMR semantic features and news propaga-\ntion features from multi-view social context graph learning.\nWhen we compare our model to supervised baselines on\nboth PolitiFact and GossipCop datasets (Table 4), it con-\nsistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms\nof accuracy, while comparable results on F1 score are ob-\nserved. On PolitiFact, our model achieves an accuracy of\n0.919 and an F1-score of 0.933, surpassing EA2N with\nBERT (0.911 accuracy, 0.915 F1-score), GACL (0.867 ac-\ncuracy, 0.866 F1-score), and EANN (0.804 accuracy, 0.798\nF1-score). However, it shows comparative performance with\ndEFEND in F1-score. On GossipCop, our model outper-\nforms all supervised baselines, achieving the highest ac-\ncuracy (0.968) and F1-score (0.966). It notably surpasses\nGACL (0.907 accuracy, 0.905 F1-score) and EA2N (0.844\naccuracy, 0.872 F1-score), as well as dEFEND, which lags\nsignificantly behind with 0.808 accuracy and 0.755 F1-\nscore. These results highlight that while supervised models\nperform well, our self-supervised approach not only com-\npetes effectively on PolitiFact but outperforms all super-\nvised baselines on GossipCop, demonstrating superior per-\nformance across datasets. Our self-supervised pipeline may\nyield stronger representations than shallow supervised mod-\nels trained only on labels. One reason is that the datasets\nhave known issues with label reliability. In such cases, su-\npervised models can overfit to spurious correlations or un-\n\nreliable labels and unsupervised models often rely on rep-\nresentation learning, which can be more robust to noise and\ngeneralize better in low-label regimes.\nTable 2: Comparative study of our model w.r.t. different un-\nsupervised baselines on PolitiFact dataset.\nMethods\nAcc\nPre\nRec\nF1\nTruthFinder\n0.581\n0.572\n0.576\n0.573\nUFNDA\n0.685\n0.667\n0.659\n0.670\nUFD\n0.697\n0.652\n0.641\n0.647\nGTUT\n0.776\n0.782\n0.758\n0.767\n(UMD)2\n0.802\n0.795\n0.748\n0.761\nGraphMAE\n0.643\n0.658\n0.641\n0.649\nGAMC\n0.838\n0.836\n0.827\n0.831\nOurs\n0.919\n0.933\n0.903\n0.918\nvariance\n\u00b1 0.019\n\u00b1 0.045\n\u00b1 0.058\n\u00b1 0.020\nTable 3: Comparative study of our model w.r.t. different un-\nsupervised baselines on GossipCop dataset.\nMethods\nAcc\nPre\nRec\nF1\nTruthFinder\n0.668\n0.669\n0.672\n0.669\nUFNDA\n0.692\n0.687\n0.662\n0.673\nUFD\n0.662\n0.687\n0.654\n0.667\nGTUT\n0.771\n0.770\n0.731\n0.744\n(UMD)2\n0.792\n0.779\n0.788\n0.783\nGraphMAE\n0.802\n0.781\n0.793\n0.787\nGAMC\n0.946\n0.941\n0.946\n0.943\nOurs\n0.968\n0.965\n0.967\n0.966\nvariance\n\u00b1 0.015\n\u00b1 0.026\n\u00b1 0.039\n\u00b1 0.015\nTable 4: Comparative study of our model with supervised\nmethods on PolitiFact and GossipCop datasets.\nDataset\nPolitiFact\nGossipCop\nAcc\nF1\nAcc\nF1\nSAFE\n0.793\n0.775\n0.832\n0.811\nEANN\n0.804\n0.798\n0.836\n0.813\ndEFEND\n0.904\n0.928\n0.808\n0.755\nGACL\n0.867\n0.866\n0.907\n0.905\nEA2N\n0.911\n0.915\n0.844\n0.872\nOurs\n0.919\n0.918\n0.968\n0.966\nAblation Study\nChange in classification result with different values of \u03bb:\nFigure 2 shows the change in classification accuracy of the\nmethod with the change in weightage to negative samples in\nEquation 4.

The results clearly demonstrate\nthat the classification accuracy improves with larger train-\ning data, which is consistent with expectations. Notably, our\nproposed model consistently outperforms traditional unsu-\npervised baselines even with limited training samples, par-\nticularly in low-resource settings. With just 10% of the train-\ning data, our model achieves superior performance on both\nthe GossipCop and PolitiFact, highlighting its effectiveness\nin data-scarce scenarios. This showcases the robustness and\ngeneralization ability of the learned representations.\nChange in results with varying number of augmentations\nk and multi-view remaskings m:\nWe study the change in\nclassification accuracy with different numbers of augmen-\ntations and remaskings for the PolitiFact dataset (Figure 3).\nWe can infer from the figure that the best results are obtained\nwhen we set k = 2 and m \u22646. This shows that multi-view\nremaskings help the model achieve superior performance,\nbut more than three remaskings do not bring considerable\nimprovements.\nChange in classification results with different compo-\nnents of our model:\nIn Table 6, we show the importance\nof different components of our model.

As we can see from the table, Llgcl and Lprop individu-\nally produce comparable results. But we get significant im-\nprovements in classification accuracy when we combine fea-\ntures generated using L = Llgcl + Lprop. We also compare\nthe performance of our model with varying versions of the\nLLM. We use two popular models, Mistral-7B and LLaMA-\n7B. We show the results when we use the LLMs indepen-\ndently for zero-shot classification. Our model significantly\nimproves the classification results using information from\nthe LLM. One must also note that there is a significant dif-\nference between the results from the two LLMs when used\nindependently. But, when used with any component of our\nmodel, this difference reduces, thus showing the robustness\nof the extracted features by the proposed method.\nQualitative results at different stages of our proposed\npipeline\nIn Figure 4 we show the feature separation be-\ntween the real and fake news at different stages of our pro-\nposed pipeline. In the first row of the Figure we see the\nresults of PolitiFact dataset and the second row we show\nthe results of the GossipCop dataset. The first column of\neach row shows the TSNE embedding of the initial fea-\ntures. The second column shows the TSNE plot of the\noriginal features after a single fully connected linear layer\n(MLP). The third column shows the TSNE plot of the fea-\ntures obtained after the self-supervised AMR graph learning\n(HGamr) phase trained with a linear layer. The last columns\nshows the TSNE plot of the final concatenated features after\nself-supervised AMR graph learning and multi-view propa-\nFigure 4: The TSNE plots showing the embeddings of Poli-\ntiFact (Row1) and GossipCop (Row2).\ngation graph learning (HGamr.HGprop) with a linear layer. In\nall the cases we train the MLP with 80% labelled data.\nTo quantify the clustering quality, we compute the silhou-\nette score at each stage. For the PolitiFact dataset, the sil-\nhouette scores are 0.33, 0.54, 0.62, and 0.64, respectively,\nindicating progressively better separation between real and\nfake news as the pipeline advances. Similarly, for the Gos-\nsipCop dataset, the silhouette scores are 0.16, 0.34, 0.38, and\n0.40, again demonstrating consistent improvement. These\nquantitative results further support the visual evidence, con-\nfirming that our model increasingly enhances feature dis-\ncriminability at each stage of the pipeline.\nConclusion\nThis study presents a novel self-supervised approach for\nmisinformation detection. The LLM-based contrastive self-\nsupervised AMR learning framework captures complex se-\nmantic relationships in text. This method enhances fea-\nture separation between real and fake news by leverag-\ning an LLM-based negative sampler. Additionally, we in-\ntroduce a multi-view graph-masked autoencoder that in-\ntegrates social context and news propagation patterns for\nmore robust detection. Through extensive experiments, the\nproposed method is found to produce state-of-the-art per-\nformance. Beyond misinformation detection, our method-\nology has broader applications in NLP. For instance, self-\nsupervised AMR graph learning can be applied to tasks like\nquestion-answering and event detection, while multi-view\nsocial context and propagation graph learning can be lever-\naged for hate speech and aggression detection, etc. This\nwork not only advances misinformation detection but also\nlays the groundwork for tackling various NLP challenges us-\ning graph-based learning in constraint settings.\nReferences\nBanarescu, L.; Bonial, C.; Cai, S.; Georgescu, M.; Griffitt,\nK.; Hermjakob, U.; Knight, K.; Koehn, P.; Palmer, M.; and\nSchneider, N. 2013.

These documents typically interleave\nnatural language with domain-specific syntax,\nsuch as mathematical equations, tables, figures,\nand cross-references, all of which must be accu-\nrately preserved to maintain semantic integrity\nand compilability. In this paper, we introduce\nLaTeXTrans, a collaborative multi-agent sys-\ntem designed to address this challenge. LaTeX-\nTrans ensures format preservation, structural\nfidelity, and terminology consistency through\nsix specialized agents: 1) a Parser that decom-\nposes LaTeX into translation-friendly units via\nplaceholder substitution and syntax filtering; 2)\na Translator, Validator, Summarizer, and Ter-\nminology Extractor that work collaboratively\nto ensure context-aware, self-correcting, and\nterminology-consistent translations; 3) a Gener-\nator that reconstructs the translated content into\nwell-structured LaTeX documents. Experimen-\ntal results demonstrate that LaTeXTrans can\noutperform mainstream MT systems in both\ntranslation accuracy and structural fidelity, of-\nfering an effective and practical solution for\ntranslating LaTeX-formatted documents.\nSystem\nVideo\n1\nIntroduction\nLaTeX is a widely adopted macro package sys-\ntem built on top of TeX, designed to facilitate the\ntypesetting of complex and structured documents.\nIt has become the de facto standard for scholarly\npublications across a wide range of scientific disci-\nplines. According to recent statistics, nearly 98%\nof scientific papers are published in English, while\nonly about 3% of the global population speaks En-\nglish as their first language (Kleidermacher and\n*Authors contributed equally.\n\u2020Corresponding author.\nZou, 2025). This linguistic disparity places con-\nsiderable pressure on non-native English speak-\ners, who are frequently required to read or write\nLaTeX-formatted documents in English. As a re-\nsult, the technical barriers to academic learning and\nresearch are significantly increased.\nA straightforward approach to ease this burden is\nto translate LaTeX documents into the user\u2019s native\nlanguage by processing the compiled PDF version,\na process referred to as PDF translation. However,\nthis approach often results in incomplete formatting\ndue to errors in PDF parsing. In contrast, a more\npromising alternative is to translate directly at the\nLaTeX source level and then compile the translated\ncontent into a target-language PDF document. This\napproach can preserve structural information and\nallows better control over formatting.\nHowever, translating LaTeX source files presents\nunique challenges not encountered in plain-text\ntranslation. LaTeX documents interleave natural\nlanguage with domain-specific markup, such as\nmathematical equations, citation commands, and\nformatting environments, all of which must be pre-\ncisely preserved to ensure semantic correctness and\nsuccessful compilation. Naively applying standard\nMT systems to LaTeX code typically leads to bro-\nken syntax, semantic errors, or formatting loss, ul-\ntimately hindering rather than helping the user.\nTo address these challenges, in this paper, we\nintroduce LaTeXTrans, a collaborative multi-agent\nsystem designed to directly translate LaTeX source\nfiles while preserving their structural and semantic\nintegrity. Our LaTeXTrans operates on raw LaTeX\ncode and maintains the full syntactic and semantic\nstructure of the document throughout the entire\ntranslation pipeline. Specifically, it comprises three\nmodules and six specialized agents:\n\u2022 Parsing Module: Responsible for fine-grained\nanalysis of LaTeX-formatted documents. To\nhandle the structural complexity of LaTeX, we\n1\narXiv:2508.18791v1  [cs.CL]  26 Aug 2025\n\n\n\ndesign a Parser agent equipped with a place-\nholder mechanism and a syntax filter, which\ntogether decompose the source into manage-\nable translation units.\n\u2022 Translation Module: This module leverages\na team of collaborative agents, including a\nTranslator, Validator, Summarizer, and Termi-\nnology Extractor, which work together to per-\nform context-aware and self-correcting trans-\nlation of the parsed units.\n\u2022 Generation Module: A Generator agent recon-\nstructs the translated document by reinserting\nthe translated content into the original LaTeX\nstructure, producing well-formatted LaTeX\nsource in the target language.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of LaTeXTrans, we\nfirst construct a LaTeX source test set using TeX\nfiles collected from arXiv papers. We then compare\nLaTeXTrans with a range of MT and LLM-based\ntranslation baselines. Experimental results demon-\nstrate that LaTeXTrans consistently outperforms\nall baselines in both translation accuracy and for-\nmat fidelity. Notably, LaTeXTrans achieves an im-\nprovement of 13.20 points on FC-score, along with\nsignificant gains in COMETkiwi and LLM-score\nwhen compared to GPT-4o.\n2\nRelated works\nLLM-based Machine Translation.\nThe emer-\ngence of LLMs has introduced a new paradigm\nfor MT, shifting away from traditional supervised\nlearning on parallel corpora toward more flexible,\ngeneral-purpose language understanding\n(Gain\net al., 2025). LLMs like GPT-3 (Brown et al.,\n2020), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), and GPT-4\ndemonstrate strong multilingual capabilities with-\nout explicit training on translation tasks. LLM-\nbased translation leverages in-context learning,\nwhere the model is prompted with examples or\ninstructions to perform translation on the fly. This\napproach has shown competitive performance in\nzero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios (Vilar\net al., 2023), especially for high-resource language\npairs. Unlike traditional neural machine translation\n(NMT), which requires retraining or fine-tuning\nfor each new domain or language, LLMs can gen-\neralize across tasks and languages with minimal\nadditional data.\nMulti-Agent Systems.\nMore recently, the emer-\ngence of LLMs has opened new possibilities for\nMulti-Agent Systems (MAS). In LLM-based multi-\nagent systems, each agent is instantiated as an\nLLM-powered entity capable of natural language\nreasoning, planning, and collaboration. Systems\nsuch as AutoGPT (Yang et al., 2023), CAMEL (Li\net al., 2023), and AutoGen (Dibia et al., 2024)\ndemonstrate that LLM agents can simulate di-\nverse roles and complete complex tasks through\ndialogue-based coordination. A growing number\nof studies explore the use of multi-agent systems\nfor translation-related tasks. Notably, MAS has\nemerged as a promising solution for document-\nlevel translation (Wang et al., 2024), a long-\nstanding challenge in MT.\nFormatted Text Translation.\nFormatted text\ntranslation involves translating documents that con-\ntain structural or semantic markup, such as La-\nTeX and XML. These formats often interleave\nnatural language with commands, tags, or tokens\nthat encode formatting, layout, or semantic anno-\ntations. Although some recent efforts have been\nmade in this direction (Kleidermacher and Zou,\n2025; Khan, 2025), formatted text translation still\nfaces two major challenges. The first is the lack of\na robust, general-purpose system specifically de-\nsigned for translating formatted content. Currently,\nonly a few proprietary tools, such as Youdao and\nBaidu, offer relatively effective solutions. While\nopen-source tools like MathTranslate* and GPT-\nAcademic\u2020 have received positive feedback, they\nstill lag behind commercial systems in overall per-\nformance. The second is the lack of a sound, for-\nmatted text translation evaluation technique. As\ntraditional BLEU or COMET scores do not cover\nformat correctness or tag retention. Therefore, it is\nimperative to develop a new evaluation technique\nfor structure-aware translation.\n3\nSystem Design\nThe key architecture of LaTeXTrans is a multi-\nagent coordination designed for translating struc-\ntured LaTeX documents. It consists of three mod-\nules: the Parser, the Translation Module, and the\nGeneration Module. The design and functionality\nof each component are described in detail below.\n*https://github.com/SUSYUSTC/MathTranslate\n\u2020https://github.com/binary-husky/gpt_academic\n2\n\n1.

To address these challenges,\nwe introduce the Parser module, which serves as\nthe first stage of the LaTeXTrans pipeline. Its basic\nidea is to transform complex LaTeX documents\ninto clean, structured translation units that are eas-\nier for LLMs to process. Specifically, we design a\nplaceholder substitution strategy to temporarily re-\nplace LaTeX-specific commands and environments,\nand implement a filtering mechanism to remove\ncomponents that do not require translation.\nPlaceholder Substitution Strategy.\nFor a com-\nmon LaTeX document, our placeholder substitu-\ntion strategy is shown in Figure 2. We consider\nthat the original mathematical formulas and charts\nare retained during translation. The first step is to\nreplace the captions in the chart with placeholders.\nThe second step is to replace the environment with\nplaceholders, which will include the vast majority\nof mathematical formulas, charts, and other parts\nthat do not need to be translated. Finally, we split\nthe replaced text into sections (including subsec-\ntions and subsubsections). For a LaTeX project\ncomposed of multiple tex files, we first merge the\nnecessary tex files into the main file and then insert\nplaceholders at the beginning and end of the merge\nfor future restoration. The subsequent placeholder\nreplacement rules and segmentation methods are\nthe same as before. From the placeholder substi-\ntution strategy, we obtain translation units of two\ngranularities: context (i.e., section and environ-\nment) and sentence (i.e., caption).\nTranslation Unit Filter.\nWhile non-translatable\ncomponents are replaced with placeholders, we\nnotice that LaTeX allows users to define custom\nenvironments, making it infeasible to rely solely\non exhaustive rule-based approaches to identify all\nsuch segments. To address this issue, we comple-\nment a predefined list of protected environments\nwith a Filter agent powered by an LLM, which\ndynamically determines whether a given environ-\nment requires translation. Each extracted environ-\nment is annotated with a binary label: True or\nFalse. The translation module subsequently pro-\ncesses only those segments labeled as True.\n3.2\nTranslation Module\nThe translation module comprises four agents: the\nTranslator, Validator, Summarizer, and Terminol-\nogy Extractor.

The mapping files are the mapping of placeholders\nand the replaced content, and they are also translation units of different granularities.\ntranslation of all designated units, the output is\npassed to the Validator, which generates an error\nreport and returns it for revision if necessary. The\nSummarizer and Terminology Extractor assist the\nTranslator by providing a summary of the preced-\ning content and a domain-specific terminology dic-\ntionary, respectively, thereby enhancing contextual\ncoherence and ensuring terminology consistency\nthroughout the translation process.\nTranslator-Validator Iteration.\nWhen utilizing\nlarge-context windows for document translation,\nlarge language models (LLMs) often prioritize cap-\nturing the overall meaning of the text, which can\nresult in the omission or mistranslation of individ-\nual sentences (Wang et al., 2024). This issue is\nparticularly pronounced in LaTeX document trans-\nlation, where LLMs may neglect or incorrectly\nrender LaTeX commands. For example, the com-\nmand \u201c\\textbf{}\u201d may be omitted, or \u201c\\left\u201d\nmay be incorrectly translated as \u201c\\\u5de6\u201d. Due to\nthe structured and sensitive syntax of LaTeX, such\nerrors are frequent and can lead to compilation fail-\nures. To address this issue, we introduce a Transla-\ntor\u2013Validator iterative framework, which performs\nmultiple rounds of verification to progressively im-\nprove LaTeX command preservation for each trans-\nlation unit. This iterative refinement significantly\nenhances the usability and reliability of the over-\nall translation system. Specifically, as illustrated\nin Figure 1, after the Translator has completed the\ntranslation of all translation units, the Validator will\nverify the quality of the translation from three di-\nmensions and eventually generate an error report.\nWhen conducting the next round of translation, the\nerroneous translation units, together with the error\nreports, will form the prompt for the Translator to\nguide them in generating the correct translation.\nSummarizer and Terminology Extractor.\nIn-\nspired by Wang et al. (2024)\u2019s work, we design a\nSummarizer and Terminology Extractor to enhance\nthe contextual coherence and terminology consis-\ntency of translation. Specifically, the Summarizer\nis responsible for constantly generating and updat-\ning the summary of the previous text during the\ntranslation process. When each translation unit is\ncompleted, the Summarizer will combine the previ-\nous summary with the original text of the current\ntranslation unit to generate a new summary. The\nTerminology Extractor is responsible for maintain-\ning a terminology dictionary and adding it to the\nprompt of the Translator to provide a reference for\nterminology translation for the Translator. When\nthe Translator finishes the translation of a transla-\ntion unit, the Terminology Extractor extracts term\npairs from the original text and the translation and\nupdates the term dictionary in real-time.\n3.3\nGeneration Module\nThe generation module is responsible for reassem-\nbling the translation units into structured LaTeX\ndocuments and compiling the structured LaTeX\ndocuments into PDF files using specific compilers\n(e.g. pdfLATEX and XeLATEX).\n4\nExperiment\n4.1\nSettings\nDatasets.\nSince no publicly available LaTeX doc-\nument dataset currently exists, we constructed our\ntest set by selecting the TeX sources of 50 English\nacademic papers from the arXiv repository. The\nchosen papers include both long and short articles,\nmany of which contain complex formulas and fig-\nures, ensuring structural diversity and complexity\nin the LaTeX content.

For the former, we selected Ni-\nuTrans and Google Translate as representative sys-\ntems. For the latter, we evaluated five strong LLMs,\nincluding both open-source and proprietary models:\nLLaMA-3.1-8B (Grattafiori et al., 2024), Qwen-3-\n8B (Yang et al., 2025), Qwen-3-14B, DeepSeek-V3\n(Liu et al., 2024), and GPT-4o (Hurst et al., 2024).\nAmong these, Qwen-3-14B, DeepSeek-V3, and\nGPT-4o were further used as the backbone models\nfor agents in LaTeXTrans.\n4.2\nEvaluation Metrics\nWe conducted a comprehensive assessment of our\nsystem from two dimensions: translation quality\nand format retention ability.\nTranslation Quality.\nBecause high-quality ref-\nerence translations for LaTeX documents re-\nquire expert-level annotation, we adopted wmt22-\ncometkiwi-da (Rei et al., 2022), a reference-free\nevaluation metric (denoted as Cometkiw), to assess\nthe translation quality of LaTeX documents. Fur-\nthermore, we employed GPT-4o as an automatic\nevaluator to further assess translation quality across\nmultiple dimensions, guided by carefully designed\nsystem prompts. The evaluation covered four as-\npects: Faithfulness, Fluency, Terminology Consis-\ntency, and Coherence, where each was rated on a\nscale from 0 to 10. An overall score was then syn-\nthesized by GPT-4o based on the individual scores\nacross these dimensions (denoted as LLM-score).\nFormat Retention Ability.\nWhether the labels\nare completely retained is an important manifes-\ntation of the ability of the formatted text transla-\ntion system. However, at present, there is no uni-\nversal indicator to evaluate the format retention\nability of models or systems during the transla-\ntion process. Therefore, for LaTeX documents, we\nhave designed a new evaluation metric, Format\nConsistency Score (denoted as FC-score), to as-\nsess the retention ability of our system for LaTeX\nlabels during the translation process. We can com-\npute the FC-score by\nFC-score = S0 \u2212\u03b1Ne \u2212\u03b2Nw + \u03b3C\n(1)\nwhere S0 is the initial score before the rewards\nand penalties, \u03b1 is the penalty coefficient per error,\n\u03b2 is the penalty coefficient per warning, \u03b3 is the\nreward for successful compilation. Ne and Nw\nare numbers of errors and warnings, C \u2208{0, 1}\nindicates whether the LaTeX document compiled\nsuccessfully. We then clip the score to the valid\nrange [Smin, Smax], Smax and Smin are the upper\nbound and lower bound of the score (e.g. 0~100).\n4.3\nResults\nWe evaluate our LaTeXTrans system on two trans-\nlation tasks:\nEnglish-to-Chinese (En-Zh) and\nEnglish-to-Japanese (En-Ja). The results, shown\nin Table 1, demonstrate that LaTeXTrans consis-\ntently outperforms both the NMT and Single-Agent\nbaselines across all evaluation metrics, including\nCOMETkiwi and FC-score. In terms of transla-\ntion quality, LaTeXTrans demonstrates substantial\nimprovements in FC-score (71.52 vs. 58.32 for\nthe En-Zh task and 70.52 vs. 63.68 for the En-\nJa task), indicating significantly better preserva-\ntion of LaTeX formatting during translation.

We hypothesize\nthat this is due to the Validator enforcing strict tag\nretention through iterative checks, which may re-\nstrict the Translator and slightly impact fluency. Fi-\nnally, incorporating the Summarizer and Terminol-\nogy Extractor improves the LLM-score, reflecting\nbetter cross-paragraph coherence. However, slight\ndeclines in COMETkiwi and FC-score suggest that\nthese improvements may not be fully captured by\nCOMETkiwi.

In this case, the\nterminology translation of LaTeXTrans remains\nconsistent across the three sections. In contrast,\nthe baseline method finds it difficult to maintain\nsuch consistency. This indicates that our system\ncan maintain excellent consistency throughout the\nentire translation process.\n5\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we propose LaTeXTrans, a multi-\nagent system for translating structured LaTeX doc-\numents. LaTeXTrans consists of three collabora-\ntive modules, each responsible for a specific stage\nof the translation pipeline. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that LaTeXTrans can outperform base-\nline systems and offer a reliable solution for LaTeX\ndocument translation.\n6\n\nLimitations\nAny instruction-following LLM can be integrated\ninto our LaTeXTrans system. However, due to the\nlarge number of available models, it is impractical\nto evaluate each one individually. Therefore, we\nselect a representative subset of commonly used\nLLMs for our experiments. We believe this se-\nlection sufficiently demonstrates the practicality\nand effectiveness of LaTeXTrans for LaTeX docu-\nment translation. Additionally, although commer-\ncial systems such as Baidu and Youdao offer La-\nTeX translation services, they are not open-source.\nAs a result, we are unable to compute metrics\nlike COMETkiwi and FC-score for these systems.\nTherefore, we do not include a comprehensive com-\nparison with them in our main experiments.\nReferences\nTom B.

Specifically, the structured LaTeX docu-\nments were segmented into section-level translation\nunits to make them manageable for translation.\nHyperparameter Setting.\nIn the experiments,\nwe evaluated both open-source and closed-source\nmodels separately. For the closed-source models,\nwe accessed them via a third-party API. In the\nbaseline approach, we set the maximum number of\nnew tokens to 16,384 and the temperature to 0.7,\nwhile keeping all other hyperparameters at their\ndefault values. For our system, the temperature in\nthe Filter was set to 0 with a maximum of 50 new\ntokens, while all other agents were configured with\na maximum of 8,192 new tokens; the remaining\nhyperparameters were kept at their defaults.\nEvaluation.\nWhen computing COMETkiwi and\nLLM-scores, we used pylatexenc\u2021 to convert\neach LaTeX translation unit into plain text. Al-\nthough LaTeXTrans parses structured LaTeX doc-\numents into fine-grained translation units, we fol-\nlowed the baseline\u2019s evaluation protocol by using\nsection-level translation units for computing both\nCOMETkiwi and LLM-scores. Furthermore, to\nassess contextual consistency in the LLM-score\nevaluation, we concatenated section-level transla-\ntion units into paired paragraphs and then scored\nthem using GPT-4o. The prompt template used\nfor scoring is illustrated in Figure 12. When calcu-\nlating the FC-score, we set the initial score S0 to\n100. Since errors have a greater impact on the final\nPDF format scheduling effect than warnings, in the\nexperiment, we set the value of \u03b1 (10) to be sig-\nnificantly greater than \u03b2 (2). Ultimately, whether\nthe compilation is successful is the most intuitive\nfactor for evaluating the compilation. Therefore, in\nthe experiment, we set the \u03b3 to 20.\nDatasets\nWe selected the LaTeX source files of\n50 academic papers in the field of computer sci-\nence from arXiv as our test set. The distribution of\npaper lengths is shown in Figure 4. Additionally,\nwe analyzed the topics of the papers and visualized\nthem as a word cloud in Figure 5. This result shows\n\u2021https://github.com/phfaist/pylatexenc\nthat the test set exhibits a diverse range of paper\nlengths, covering both short and long documents,\nwhich helps ensure robustness across different doc-\nument sizes. Moreover, the word cloud reveals a\nwide variety of research topics within the computer\nscience domain, confirming the topical diversity\nof the test set and enhancing the generality of our\nevaluation.\n2.5k\n5k\n7.5k\n10k\n12.5k\n15k\n17.5k\n20k\nWord Count\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\nPercentage of Papers (%)\nFigure 4: Distribution of paper lengths (in word count)\nin our test set.\nFigure 5: Word cloud visualization of topics covered in\nour test set.\nB\nSystem Performance Display\nWe select six cases to visually demonstrate the\ntranslation performance of our system, focusing\non En-Zh and En-Ja translation tasks, as illustrated\nin Figure 6 to Figure 11.

We systematically integrate techniques from prior work, such as Clip-Higher and Token-level Loss from\nDAPO [29], Value-Pretraining and Decoupled-GAE from VC-PPO [30], self-imitation learning from SIL\n[14], and Group-Sampling from GRPO [22]. Additionally, we further validate their necessity through\nablation studies.\nVAPO is an effective reinforcement learning system that brings together these improvements. These enhance-\nments work together smoothly, leading to a combined result that\u2019s better than the sum of the individual parts.\nWe conduct experiments using the Qwen2.5-32B pre-trained model, ensuring no SFT data is introduced in any\nof the experiments, to maintain comparability with related works (DAPO and DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B).\nThe performance of VAPO improves from vanilla PPO a score of 5 to 60, surpassing the previous SOTA\nvalue-model-free methods DAPO [29] by 10 points. More importantly, VAPO is highly stable \u2014 we don\u2019t\nobserve any crashes during training, and the results across multiple runs are consistently similar.\n2\nPreliminaries\nThis section presents the fundamental concepts and notations that serve as the basis for our proposed algorithm.\nWe first explore the basic framework of representing language generation as a reinforcement learning task.\nSubsequently, we introduce Proximal Policy Optimization and Generalized Advantage Estimation.\n2.1\nModeling Language Generation as Token-Level MDP\nReinforcement learning centers around the learning of a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward for\nan agent as it interacts with an environment. In this study, we cast language generation tasks within the\nframework of a Markov Decision Process (MDP) [17].\nLet the prompt be denoted as x, and the response to this prompt as y. Both x and y can be decomposed into\nsequences of tokens. For example, the prompt x can be expressed as x = (x0, . . . , xm), where the tokens are\ndrawn from a fixed discrete vocabulary A.\nWe define the token-level MDP as the tuple M = (S, A, P, R, d0, \u03c9). Here is a detailed breakdown of each\ncomponent:\n\u2022 State Space (S): This space encompasses all possible states formed by the tokens generated up to a given\ntime step. At time step t, the state st is defined as st = (x0, . . . , xm, y0, . . . , yt).\n\u2022 Action Space (A): It corresponds to the fixed discrete vocabulary, from which tokens are selected during the\ngeneration process.\n\u2022 Dynamics (P): These represent a deterministic transition model between tokens. Given a state st =\n(x0, . . . , xm, y0, . . . , yt), an action a = yt+1, and the subsequent state st+1 = (x0, . . . , xm, y0, . . . , yt, yt+1),\nthe probability P(st+1|st, a) = 1.\n\u2022 Termination Condition: The language generation process concludes when the terminal action \u03c9, typically\nthe end-of-sentence token, is executed.\n\u2022 Reward Function (R(s, a)): This function offers scalar feedback to evaluate the agent\u2019s performance after\ntaking action a in state s. In the context of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) [18, 23],\nthe reward function can be learned from human preferences or defined by a set of rules specific to the task.\n\u2022 Initial State Distribution (d0): It is a probability distribution over prompts x. An initial state s0 consists of\nthe tokens within the prompt x.\n2.2\nRLHF Learning Objective\nWe formulate the optimization problem as a KL-regularized RL task. Our objective is to approximate the\noptimal KL-regularized policy, which is given by:\n\u03c0\u2217= arg max\n\u03c0\nE\u03c0,s0\u223cd0\n\" H\nX\nt=0\n\u0000R(st, at)

1.\nIn this equation, H represents the total number of decision steps, s0 is a prompt sampled from the dataset,\nR(st, at) is the token-level reward obtained from the reward function, \u03b2 is a coefficient that controls the\nstrength of the KL-regularization, and \u03c0ref is the initialization policy.\nIn traditional RLHF and most tasks related to LLMs, the reward is sparse and is only assigned at the terminal\naction \u03c9, that is, the end-of-sentence token <eos>.\n2.3\nProximal Policy Optimization\nPPO [21] uses a clipped surrogate objective to update the policy. The key idea is to limit the change in the\npolicy during each update step, preventing large policy updates that could lead to instability.\nLet \u03c0\u03b8(a|s) be the policy parameterized by \u03b8, and \u03c0\u03b8old(a|s) be the old policy from the previous iteration.\nThe surrogate objective function for PPO is defined as:\nLCLIP (\u03b8) = \u02c6Et\nh\nmin\n\u0010\nrt(\u03b8) \u02c6At, clip(rt(\u03b8), 1 \u2212\u03f5, 1 + \u03f5) \u02c6At\n\u0011i\n(2)\nwhere rt(\u03b8) =\n\u03c0\u03b8(at|st)\n\u03c0\u03b8old(at|st) is the probability ratio, \u02c6At is the estimated advantage at time step t, and \u03f5 is a\nhyperparameter that controls the clipping range.\nGeneralized Advantage Estimation [20] is a technique used to estimate the advantage function more accurately\nin PPO. It combines multiple-step bootstrapping to reduce the variance of the advantage estimates. For a\ntrajectory of length T, the advantage estimate \u02c6At at time step t is computed as:\n\u02c6At =\nT \u2212t\u22121\nX\nl=0\n(\u03b3\u03bb)l\u03b4t+l\n(3)\nwhere \u03b3 is the discount factor, \u03bb \u2208[0, 1] is the GAE parameter, and \u03b4t = R(st, at) + \u03b3V (st+1) \u2212V (st) is the\ntemporal-difference (TD) error. Here, R(st, at) is the reward at time step t, and V (s) is the value function.\nSince it is a common practice to use discount factor \u03b3 = 1.0 in RLHF, to simplify our notation, we omit \u03b3 in\nlater sections of this paper.\n3\nChallenges in Long-CoT RL for Reasoning Tasks\nLong-CoT tasks present unique challenges to RL training, especially for methods that employ a value model\nto reduce variance. In this section, we systematically analyze the technical issues arising from sequence length\ndynamics, value function instability, and reward sparsity.\n3.1\nValue Model Bias over Long Sequences\nAs identified in VC-PPO [30], initializing the value model with a reward model introduces significant\ninitialization bias. This positive bias arises from an objective mismatch between the two models. The reward\nmodel is trained to score on the <EOS> token, incentivizing it to assign lower scores to earlier tokens due to\ntheir incomplete context. In contrast, the value model estimates the expected cumulative reward for all tokens\npreceding <EOS> under a given policy. During early training phases, given the backward computation of GAE,\nthere will be a positive bias at every timestep t that accumulates along the trajectory.\nAnother standard practice of using GAE with \u03bb = 0.95 might exacerbates this issue. The reward signal\nR(sT , <EOS>) at the termination token propagates backward as \u03bbT \u2212tR(sT , <EOS>) to the t-th token. For\nlong sequences where T \u2212t \u226b1, this discounting reduces the effective reward signal to near zero. Consequently,\nvalue updates become almost entirely bootstrapped, relying on highly biased estimates that undermine the\nvalue model\u2019s role as a reliable variance-reduction baseline.\n4\n(c) The

Introduction\nIn recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been undergoing rapid iteration and\nevolution (Anthropic, 2024; Google, 2024; OpenAI, 2024a), progressively diminishing the gap\ntowards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).\nRecently, post-training has emerged as an important component of the full training pipeline.\nIt has been shown to enhance accuracy on reasoning tasks, align with social values, and adapt\nto user preferences, all while requiring relatively minimal computational resources against\npre-training. In the context of reasoning capabilities, OpenAI\u2019s o1 (OpenAI, 2024b) series models\nwere the first to introduce inference-time scaling by increasing the length of the Chain-of-\nThought reasoning process. This approach has achieved significant improvements in various\nreasoning tasks, such as mathematics, coding, and scientific reasoning. However, the challenge\nof effective test-time scaling remains an open question for the research community. Several prior\nworks have explored various approaches, including process-based reward models (Lightman\net al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), reinforcement learning (Kumar et al., 2024),\nand search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and Beam Search (Feng et al., 2024; Trinh\net al., 2024; Xin et al., 2024). However, none of these methods has achieved general reasoning\nperformance comparable to OpenAI\u2019s o1 series models.\nIn this paper, we take the first step toward improving language model reasoning capabilities\nusing pure reinforcement learning (RL). Our goal is to explore the potential of LLMs to develop\nreasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through\na pure RL process. Specifically, we use DeepSeek-V3-Base as the base model and employ\nGRPO (Shao et al., 2024) as the RL framework to improve model performance in reasoning.\nDuring training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting\nreasoning behaviors. After thousands of RL steps, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits super performance\non reasoning benchmarks. For instance, the pass@1 score on AIME 2024 increases from 15.6% to\n71.0%, and with majority voting, the score further improves to 86.7%, matching the performance\nof OpenAI-o1-0912.\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language\nmixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce\nDeepSeek-R1, which incorporates a small amount of cold-start data and a multi-stage training\npipeline. Specifically, we begin by collecting thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the\nDeepSeek-V3-Base model. Following this, we perform reasoning-oriented RL like DeepSeek-R1-\nZero. Upon nearing convergence in the RL process, we create new SFT data through rejection\nsampling on the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data from DeepSeek-V3 in domains\nsuch as writing, factual QA, and self-cognition, and then retrain the DeepSeek-V3-Base model.\nAfter fine-tuning with the new data, the checkpoint undergoes an additional RL process, taking\ninto account prompts from all scenarios. After these steps, we obtained a checkpoint referred to\nas DeepSeek-R1, which achieves performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217.\nWe further explore distillation from DeepSeek-R1 to smaller dense models. Using Qwen2.5-\n32B (Qwen, 2024b) as the base model, direct distillation from DeepSeek-R1 outperforms applying\nRL on it. This demonstrates that the reasoning patterns discovered by larger base models are cru-\ncial for improving reasoning capabilities. We open-source the distilled Qwen and Llama (Dubey\net al., 2024) series. Notably, our distilled 14B model outperforms state-of-the-art open-source\nQwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a) by a large margin, and the distilled 32B and 70B models set a\nnew record on the reasoning benchmarks among dense models.\n3\n(a) The first part of the English PDF of case 2.\n1. \u4ecb\u7ecd\n\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u6b63\u5728\u7ecf\u5386\u5feb\u901f\u8fed\u4ee3\u548c\u6f14\u53d8(Anthropic, 2024;

It achieves an impressive\nlength-controlled win-rate of 87.6% on AlpacaEval 2.0 and a win-rate of 92.3% on Are-\nnaHard, showcasing its strong ability to intelligently handle non-exam-oriented queries.\nAdditionally, DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates outstanding performance on tasks requiring\nlong-context understanding, substantially outperforming DeepSeek-V3 on long-context\nbenchmarks.\n2. Approach\n2.1. Overview\nPrevious work has heavily relied on large amounts of supervised data to enhance model\nperformance. In this study, we demonstrate that reasoning capabilities can be significantly\nimproved through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), even without using supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start. Furthermore, performance can be further enhanced with\nthe inclusion of a small amount of cold-start data. In the following sections, we present: (1)\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero, which applies RL directly to the base model without any SFT data, and\n(2) DeepSeek-R1, which applies RL starting from a checkpoint fine-tuned with thousands of\nlong Chain-of-Thought (CoT) examples. 3) Distill the reasoning capability from DeepSeek-R1 to\nsmall dense models.\n2.2. DeepSeek-R1-Zero: Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\nReinforcement learning has demonstrated significant effectiveness in reasoning tasks, as ev-\nidenced by our previous works (Shao et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023). However, these works\nheavily depended on supervised data, which are time-intensive to gather. In this section, we\nexplore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data,\nfocusing on their self-evolution through a pure reinforcement learning process. We start with a\nbrief overview of our RL algorithm, followed by the presentation of some exciting results, and\nhope this provides the community with valuable insights.\n2.2.1. Reinforcement Learning Algorithm\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization\nIn order to save the training costs of RL, we adopt Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), which foregoes the critic model that is\ntypically the same size as the policy model, and estimates the baseline from group scores instead.\nSpecifically, for each question \ud835\udc5e, GRPO samples a group of outputs {\ud835\udc5c1, \ud835\udc5c2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc3a} from the old\npolicy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc51and then optimizes the policy model \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03by maximizing the following objective:\nJ\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc42(\ud835\udf03) = E[\ud835\udc5e\u223c\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc44), {\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56}\ud835\udc3a\n\ud835\udc56=1 \u223c\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc51(\ud835\udc42|\ud835\udc5e)]\n1\n\ud835\udc3a\n\ud835\udc3a\n\u2211\ufe01\n\ud835\udc56=1\n\u0012\nmin\n\u0012 \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56|\ud835\udc5e)\n\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc51(\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56|\ud835\udc5e) \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc56, clip\n\u0012 \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56|\ud835\udc5e)\n\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc51(\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56|\ud835\udc5e) , 1 \u2212\ud835\udf00, 1 + \ud835\udf00\n\u0013\n\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc56\n\u0013\n\u2212\ud835\udefdD\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3f\n\u0000\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03||\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc53\n\u0001\u0013\n,\n(1)\nD\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3f\n\u0000\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03||\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc53\n\u0001 =\n\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56|\ud835\udc5e)\n\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56|\ud835\udc5e) \u2212log\n\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56|\ud835\udc5e)\n\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56|\ud835\udc5e) \u22121,\n(2)\nwhere \ud835\udf00and \ud835\udefdare hyper-parameters, and \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc56is the advantage, computed using a group of\nrewards {\ud835\udc5f1, \ud835\udc5f2, . . . , \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc3a} corresponding to the outputs within each group:\n\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc56= \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\u2212m\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b({\ud835\udc5f1, \ud835\udc5f2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc3a})\ns\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc51({\ud835\udc5f1, \ud835\udc5f2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc3a})\n.\n(3)\n5\n(c) The second part of the English PDF of case 2.\n\u2022 \u5176\u4ed6: DeepSeek-R1 \u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u3001\u4e00\u822c\u95ee\u7b54\u3001\u7f16\u8f91\u3001\u603b\u7ed3\n\u7b49\u3002\u5728AlpacaEval 2.0 \u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e8687.6% \u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u80dc\u7387\uff0c\u5728ArenaHard \u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e8692.3%\n\u7684\u80dc\u7387\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5176\u667a\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u975e\u8003\u8bd5\u5bfc\u5411\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cDeepSeek-R1 \u5728\u9700\u8981\u957f\u4e0a\n\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86DeepSeek-V3\u3002\n2. \u65b9\u6cd5\n2.1. \u6982\u8ff0\n\u4ee5\u5f80\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5728\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5373\u4f7f\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\n\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u5c11\u91cf\n\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5728\u63a5\u4e0b\u6765\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4ecb\u7ecd\uff1a(1) DeepSeek-R1-Zero\uff0c\u5b83\u76f4\n\u63a5\u5c06RL \u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u800c\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u4f55SFT \u6570\u636e\uff0c(2) DeepSeek-R1\uff0c\u5b83\u4ece\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u957f\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\n\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u793a\u4f8b\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u5f00\u59cb\u5e94\u7528RL\uff0c(3) \u5c06DeepSeek-R1 \u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u70bc\u5230\u5c0f\u578b\u7a20\u5bc6\u6a21\n\u578b\u4e2d\u3002\n2.2.\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero : \u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\n\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u8bc1\u5b9e(Shao et al.,\n2024;

Classical 2D MUSIC Algorithm\nThe MUSIC algorithm is widely used for AoA estimation\nthrough eigenvalue decomposition. Based on the model in (9),\nthe covariance matrix of the received signals is given by\nR = E[Y Y H]\n= ARssAH + \u03c32I,\n(10)\nwhere Rss = E[SSH] is the correlation matrix of the source\nsignals. The eigenvectors of R associated with the largest D\neigenvalues span the signal subspace ES, while the remaining\neigenvectors span the noise subspace EN. The 2D MUSIC\nAoA pseudo-spectrum is defined as\nPM(\u03b8, \u03d5) =\naH(\u03b8, \u03d5)a(\u03b8, \u03d5)\naH(\u03b8, \u03d5)ENEH\nNa(\u03b8, \u03d5)\n.\n(11)\nThe angles corresponding to the peaks in this pseudo-spectrum\nprovide estimates of the directions of the incident signals.\nC. I-SSMUSIC for 3D AoA\nIn contrast to 2D AoA estimation, 3D AoA estimation\ndemands significantly higher computational complexity. More-\nover, 3D localization tasks are further challenged by the\nincreased severity of multipath propagation. A well-known\nlimitation of subspace-based methods is their degraded per-\nformance in the presence of correlated sources, primarily due\nto rank deficiency in the covariance matrix. A notable solution\nto mitigate this issue is the spatial smoothing technique.\nWe now present an improved MUSIC algorithm with 2D\nspatial smoothing, referred to as I-SSMUSIC, designed for\nURAs. Based on (9), the (m1, m2)-th smoothed subarrays of\nsize M1 \u00d7 M2 is formally expressed as\nY m1m2 = A1Dm1\u22121\nx\nDm2\u22121\ny\n\u00b7 S + N m1m2,\n(12)\nwhere\nDx = diag[u(\u03b81, \u03d51), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , u(\u03b8L, \u03d5L)],\nDy = diag[v(\u03b81, \u03d51), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , v(\u03b8L, \u03d5L)].\n(13)\nHere N m1m2 is the noise matrix at the (m1, m2)-th subar-\nray and A1 = [a1(\u03b81, \u03d51) a1(\u03b82, \u03d52) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 a1(\u03b8L, \u03d5L)] is the\nsteering matrix, where each a1(\u03b8l, \u03d5l) is given by\na1(\u03b8l, \u03d5l) = ay,M1 (\u03b8l, \u03d5l) \u2297ax,M1 (\u03b8l, \u03d5l) ,\nax,M1(\u03b8, \u03d5) =\n\u0002\n1\nu\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nuM1\u22121\u0003\u22a4,\nay,M2(\u03b8, \u03d5) =\n\u0002\n1\nv\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nvM2\u22121\u0003\u22a4.\n(14)\nx\ny\nz\nMx\nMy\nM1\nM2\nSubarrary 1\nSubarrary m\nForward smoothing\nBackward smoothing\nFig. 6. I-SSMUSIC of URA with forward-backward spatial smoothing applied\nto each subarray.\nUsing (12), we can reformulate the expression in (10). The\ncovariance matrix of the (m1, m2)-th subarray is therefore\ngiven by\nRf\nm1m2 = A1Dm1\u22121\nx\nDm2\u22121\ny\nRss\n\u0000Dm2\u22121\ny\n\u0001H\n\u00d7\n\u0000Dm1\u22121\nx\n\u0001H AH\n1 + \u03c32I.\n(15)\nIn the spatial smoothing scheme, the forward smoothed co-\nvariance matrix Rf is obtained by averaging the covariance\nmatrices of all forward subarrays, yielding\nRf =\n1\nHxHy\nHx\nX\nm1=1\nHy\nX\nm2=1\nRf\nm1m2 = A1Rf\nsAH\n1 + \u03c32I, (16)\nwhere Hx = Mx \u2212M1 +1 and Hy = My \u2212M2 +1. Similarly,\nwe denote the forward-smoothed source covariance matrix by\nRf\ns, which is defined by\nRf\ns =\n1\nHxHy\nHx\nX\nm1=1\nHy\nX\nm2=1\nDm1\u22121\nx\nDm2\u22121\ny\nRss\n\u00d7\n\u0000Dm2\u22121\ny\n\u0001H \u0000Dm1\u22121\nx\n\u0001H .\n(17)\nThe spatially smoothed covariance matrix enables the appli-\ncation of eigenstructure-based methods for AoA estimation,\neven in the presence of coherent signals.\nOne limitation of the spatial smoothing algorithm is its\ntendency to reduce the effective array aperture, which may\ndegrade sensing performance [17]. To mitigate this issue, we\nintroduce a forward-backward spatial smoothing scheme for\nURAs, as illustrated in Fig. 6. This bidirectional smoothing\napproach preserves the aperture size by exploiting the conju-\ngate symmetry property of the covariance matrix.\nMathematically, the forward-backward spatially

7. Spatial spectrum of four correlated sources generated using a 3 \u00d7 4\nantenna array. (a), (b) and (c) show the 2D spatial spectrums computed by\nMUSIC, SS-MUSIC and I-SSMUSIC, respectively.\nof correlated signals while mitigating the effects of rank\ndeficiency.\nBy examining (16) and (18), we observe that the number\nof forward-only smoothed subarrays, denoted by H, deter-\nmines the maximum number of resolvable correlated sources,\nwhereas forward-backward smoothing effectively doubles this\nlimit to 2H. In typical indoor environments, where the number\nof multipath components is usually fewer than five [13], [17],\na single forward-backward smoothing operation (H = 2) can\ndecorrelate signals from up to four distinct angles.\nWe now present a comparative evaluation of conventional\nMUSIC, MUSIC with forward-only spatial smoothing (SS-\nMUSIC), and the proposed I-SSMUSIC for estimating the an-\ngles of four correlated signals under identical conditions. The\nURA consists of 3\u00d74 antennas. Four correlated signal sources\nemit continuous signals with an SNR of 15 dB, arriving from\nthe following angles: (21.8\u25e6, 90\u25e6), (32\u25e6, 56\u25e6), (15\u25e6, \u221260\u25e6)\nand (60\u25e6, \u2212150\u25e6), respectively. The spatial spectra are illus-\ntrated in Fig. 7, from which it is evident that the proposed\nI-SSMUSIC outperforms the other methods. The estimated\nAoAs using I-SSMUSIC are (21.8\u25e6, 90.8\u25e6), (32.4\u25e6, 57.2\u25e6),\n(16.4\u25e6, \u221259.6\u25e6) and (60.2\u25e6, \u2212150.6\u25e6), respectively. In com-\nparison, while SS-MUSIC is capable of estimating correlated\nsignals, it exhibits notably lower resolution. Its estimated\nAoAs are (22.8\u25e6, 82.2\u25e6), (37.2\u25e6, 50.8\u25e6), (15.2\u25e6, \u221262\u25e6) and\n(58.8\u25e6, \u2212149.6\u25e6). The standard MUSIC algorithm, by con-\ntrast, fails to resolve the correlated sources, resulting in an\nambiguous and inaccurate AoA spectrum.\nD. Closest Geometric Point Estimation\nWith AoA estimations obtained from multiple URAs dis-\ntributed across space, the specific location of the signal source\ncan be determined. Ideally, the estimated AoA vectors intersect\nat the true position of the source. However, due to measure-\nment errors, a robust closest-point estimation algorithm is\nrequired to approximate the actual point of intersection. The\nproposed geometric positioning (GP) method first identifies\nthe closest points between each pair of AoAs, as illustrated in\nStage 1 of Fig. 8. The final position estimate is then computed\nas the mean of these closest points.\nLet li denote the estimated arrival ray associated with the i-\nth URA. Each ray can be represented by a parametric equation\nof the form\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nr1 = c1 + t1d1,\n...\nri = ci + tidi,\n...\nru = cu + tudu,\n(20)\nwhere ci \u2208R3 denotes the center of the i-th URA, and di \u2208\nR3 is the direction vector of the arrival ray li. To identify the\nvector th,i = [th ti]\u22a4that best approximates the intersection\nof the h-th and i-th AoA rays, we solve the following equation\n\u0014\u2212d\u22a4\nh dh\nd\u22a4\ni dh\n\u2212d\u22a4\nh di\nd\u22a4\ni di\n\u0015 \u0014th\nti\n\u0015\n=\n\u0014(ch \u2212ci) \u00b7 di\n(ch \u2212ci) \u00b7 dh\n\u0015\n.\n(21)\nIf there is no exact intersection, the least-squares solution t\u2217=\n[t\u2217\nh,i t\u2217\ni,h]\u22a4determines the pair of closest points on the two\nrays. The coordinates of these points are given by\nc\u2217\nh,i = ch + t\u2217\nh,idh, c\u2217\ni,h = ci + t\u2217\ni,hdi.\n(22)\nFinally, the estimated position of the source based on all u\nURAs is computed as\nc\u2217=\n1\nu(u \u22121)\nu\u22121\nX\nh=1\nu\nX\ni=h+1\n(c\u2217\nh,i + c\u2217\ni,h) = [x\u2217, y\u2217, z\u2217].\n(23)\nIV. COLLABORATIVE 3D DIRECT POSITION\nDETERMINATION\nFor the previously described closest geometric point ap-\nproach, collaboration is performed at the level of estimated\nAoAs, as the involved URAs are not synchronized with\neach other. Given that signal synchronization among ele-\nments within each array has now been implemented, a nat-\nural question arises: can this synchronization mechanism be\nfurther extended to the inter-array level to enable greater\ncooperative gains? In this section, we develop an inter-array\nsynchronization framework designed to facilitate direct po-\nsition determination (DPD) [38], [39]. Unlike the preceding\nclosest point estimation method, DPD bypasses intermediate\nparameter estimation, such as AoA, and instead computes the\nsource position directly in a single step.\nTo reduce the spatial sampling overhead of the proposed\nDPD algorithm, we first employ the I-SSMUSIC and closest\npoint estimation approaches to define a compact localized\nspace of interest (LSoI). By discretizing the LSoI, we derive a\nmeasurement model that characterizes the observation process\nacross multiple synchronized URAs. Synchronization among\nthese arrays is achieved by measuring phase differences rel-\native to a common reference signal. Once synchronization is\nestablished, the distributed URAs effectively form a virtual\nlarge-scale array, enabling the computation of the MUSIC\npseudo-spectrum at the spatial sampling points within the\nLSoI. To further expand the LSoI and enhance estimation\nfidelity, we introduce a progressive local traversal strategy. The\noverall process is illustrated in Fig. 8.\nFor simplicity, the LSoI is configured as a sphere of radius\nR, centered at the closest geometric point c\u2217estimated via the\nI-SSMUSIC algorithm. The sphere is discretized with a voxel\n(c) The second part of the English PDF of case

The AirRoom coarse-to-fine pipeline. The pipeline begins with the Global Feature Extractor, which captures global context\nfeatures to retrieve the top-5 reference images. Instance segmentation then generates object masks, followed by the Receptive Field\nExpander, which extracts object patches. The Object Feature Extractor processes both object and patch features. The Object-Aware\nScoring module narrows the selection to the top-2 candidates, and Fine-Grained Retrieval identifies the most suitable reference image.\nHowever, the high performance of most VPR approaches\nis largely attributed to large-scale training on VPR-specific\ndatasets [16]. Collecting extensive data for outdoor scenes\nis relatively straightforward due to natural variations in day-\nlight, weather, and seasons. However, such data collection\nis more challenging in indoor rooms, making large-scale\ntraining on indoor datasets difficult and potentially limit-\ning their effectiveness. Our approach effectively tackles this\nchallenge by focusing on object-oriented feature represen-\ntations, allowing us to leverage mature, pre-trained models\nfor object feature learning. This design enables AirRoom to\ndeliver robust performance without requiring any additional\ntraining or fine-tuning on specific datasets.\n3. Proposed Approach\nWe propose a simple yet highly effective pipeline, Air-\nRoom, for room reidentification that leverages multi-level\nobject-oriented information, as shown in Figure 2. We will\nnow systematically introduce each module of the pipeline,\nfollowing the sequence of stages in which they are executed.\n3.1. Global Stage\nIn this stage, we utilize the Global Feature Extractor to cap-\nture global context features, which are derived from the col-\nlective presence of objects within the room. These features\nare then used for Global Retrieval, coarsely selecting se-\nmantically similar candidate rooms from the database.\n3.1.1. Global Feature Extractor\nIndoor rooms exhibit fewer variations compared to out-\ndoor environments. They lack diverse topographies, such as\naerial, subterranean, or underwater features, and do not ex-\nperience temporal changes like day-night or seasonal vari-\nations. Consequently, collecting large datasets for each in-\ndoor room is challenging, complicating large-scale training\nas seen in many VPR methods [1, 2, 13].\nHowever, indoor rooms are inherently rich in objects,\neach contributing to the room\u2019s overall semantic context.\nBy leveraging this global context information, we can re-\nfine the reference search to specifically focus on rooms with\nsimilar semantic features to those in the query image. For\nthis purpose, we prefer backbones pretrained on large im-\nage datasets, as they provide strong generalizability and ef-\nfectively capture informative global context features [17].\nOur model selections, therefore, include pretrained CNN-\nbased models such as ResNet [14] and transformer-based\nself-supervised models like DINOv2 [25].\n3.1.2. Global Retrieval\nUsing the Global Feature Extractor, we extract global con-\ntext features for M query and N reference images. Let\nQ \u2208RM\u00d7Dg and R \u2208RN\u00d7Dg denote the query and refer-\nence features, respectively, where Dg is the feature dimen-\nsion. The cosine similarity matrix S is then computed as:\nSij =\nQi \u00b7 Rj\n\u2225Qi\u2225\u2225Rj\u2225.\n(1)\nFor each query, we select the top-5 most similar reference\ncandidates using the following formula:\nTop5(Si,:) = argsort(\u2212Si,:)[: 5],\n(2)\nwhere Si,: represents the cosine similarity for the i-th query.\n3.2. Local Stage\nGlobal context features provide valuable semantic informa-\ntion that helps narrow down the candidate list. However,\nwhen faced with many semantically similar rooms, rely-\ning solely on global context is insufficient, and local fea-\ntures become increasingly essential. In this stage, we adopt\na local perspective by first applying instance segmentation\nand the Receptive Field Expander to identify objects and\npatches. We then use the Object Feature Extractor to ex-\ntract features from both objects and patches, followed by\nObject-Aware Scoring to further refine the candidate list.\n3\n(a) The first part of the English PDF of case 4.\nQuery\nReference\nDatabase\nGlobal\nFeature\nExtractor\nGlobal\nRetrieval\nInstance\nSegmentation\nPatches\nObject\nFeature\nExtractor\nObject-Aware\nScoring\nFine-Grained\nRetrieval\nReceptive\nField\nExpander\nObjects\nTop-5\nTop-2\nTop-1\nGlobal \nStage\nLocal\nStage\nFine-Grained\nStage\nFigure 2.

The first part of the Japanese PDF of case 4.\n3.2.1. Instance Segmentation\nFor each query image and its corresponding five candidates,\nwe employ instance segmentation methods, such as Mask\nR-CNN [15] and Semantic-SAM [20], to identify and delin-\neate individual objects. This process generates each object\u2019s\nmask and bounding box. Next, we calculate the center point\nc of each object using its bounding box, as shown below:\nc = (x + W\n2\n, y + H\n2\n).\n(3)\nIn this equation, x and y represent the pixel coordinates of\nthe top-left corner of the bounding box, while W and H de-\nnote the width and height of the bounding box, respectively.\n3.2.2. Receptive Field Expander\nSingle object information alone is not sufficiently discrim-\ninative. For example, although different desks may have\ndistinct appearances, they can be found in both dining halls\nand offices. However, when an object is connected with its\nneighboring items\u2014such as a desk alongside a computer,\nkeyboard, or notebook\u2014it suggests that the room is more\nlikely to be an office rather than a dining hall. This insight\nmotivates us to expand the receptive field from a single ob-\nject to a patch containing multiple objects.\nGiven the center points of all objects in an image, we em-\nploy Delaunay triangulation [6] to generate a triangulated\ngraph of object relationships. Specifically, Delaunay trian-\ngulation is applied to the set of object centers, ensuring that\nno object centers are inside the circumcircle of any triangle.\nThis method maximizes the minimum angle of the triangles,\npreventing narrow, elongated triangles and ensuring more\nuniform object adjacency. By analyzing the adjacency re-\nlationships among the resulting triangles, we can construct\nthe object adjacency matrix, which encodes the spatial and\nrelational proximity of objects within the room.\nFigure 3. The Receptive Field Expander broadens the receptive\nfield from individual objects to patches rich in contextual infor-\nmation. Leveraging the object adjacency matrix and each object\u2019s\nbounding box, it expands single objects such as a cupboard, win-\ndow pane, and chair into object patches like a modular kitchen,\nmulti-pane window, and dining set, respectively.\nGiven the object adjacency matrix and bounding boxes in\nan image, for each object, we consider the bounding boxes\nof its neighboring objects and enlarge the current object\u2019s\nbounding box to encompass all adjacent objects. This ex-\npansion increases the receptive field, enabling us to capture\nricher contextual information, as illustrated in Figure 3. We\nthen apply Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to select the\nhighest confidence bounding boxes, removing overlapping\nones based on their Intersection over Union (IoU) scores.\nThis results in a set of clean, informative object patches.\n3.2.3. Object-Aware Refinement\nThe Object-Aware Refinement module is composed of three\nkey submodules: Object Feature Extractor, Mutual Nearest\nNeighbors, and Object-Aware Scoring.\nObject Feature Extractor\nTo effectively leverage object\npatches and object segmentation information, we prioritize\nglobal features over local feature aggregation. The latter\napproach may fail to capture object characteristics effec-\ntively and can significantly increase computational com-\nplexity and storage demands [49]. As discussed in Sec-\ntion 3.1.1, we continue to rely on models pre-trained on\nlarge image datasets. Using the Object Feature Extractor,\nwe obtain features for both query and reference patches and\nobjects. Let Qp = {pq\ni }nqp\ni=1 and Qo = {oq\ni }nqo\ni=1 represent\nthe query patch and object feature sets, respectively. For\neach reference image among the query\u2019s five candidates,\nwe define the reference patch and object feature sets as\nRp = {pr\ni }nrp\ni=1 and Ro = {or\ni }nro\ni=1.\nMutual Nearest Neighbors\nGiven a set of query features\n{f q\ni }nq\ni=1 and reference features {f r\ni }nr\ni=1, we obtain fea-\nture pairs by identifying mutual nearest neighbor matches\nthrough exhaustive comparison of the two sets. Let P de-\nnote the set of cosine similarity scores for these mutual near-\nest neighbor matches, then we have\nP = {cos(f q\ni , f r\nj ) | i = NNr(f r\nj ), j = NNq(f q\ni )}\n(4)\nwhere\nNNq(f q\ni ) = arg max\nj\n \nf q\ni \u00b7 f r\nj\n\u2225f q\ni \u2225\u2225f r\nj \u2225\n!\n,\n(5)\nNNr(f r\ni ) = arg max\nj\n \nf r\ni \u00b7 f q\nj\n\u2225f r\ni \u2225\u2225f q\nj \u2225\n!\n,\n(6)\ncos(f q\ni , f r\nj ) =\nf q\ni \u00b7 f r\nj\n\u2225f q\ni \u2225\u2225f r\nj \u2225.\n(7)\nBy utilizing mutual nearest neighbors, we can significantly\nimprove retrieval accuracy, simultaneously narrowing the\nsearch space and enhancing overall retrieval efficiency [50].\nObject-Aware Scoring\nThe object-aware score s is the\nsum of the global score sglobal (calculated in Equation 1),\nthe patch score spatch, and the object score sobject:\ns = sglobal + spatch(Qp, Rp) + sobject(Qo, Ro).\n(8)\n4\n(c) The second part of the English PDF of case

patch embedding, resulting in\nE0 \u2208RM\u00d7dv, where M represents the number of patches\nand dv the embedding dimension. The initial patch embed-\ndings E0 are combined with a learnable class token c0 and\npositional encodings, forming the input sequence for the\ntransformer layers. Each layer processes this sequence as\n[ci, Ei] = Vi([ci\u22121, Ei\u22121])\ni = 1, 2, . . . , L\nAfter passing through all transformer layers, a patch pro-\njection layer, P c\nv, projects the output of the class token, cL,\ninto a shared V-L latent space,\nf = P c\nv(cL)\nwhere f \u2208Rd.\nText Encoding: For an input text, e.g., \u201cA photo of a\n[CLASS].\u201d, it is tokenized and converted into embeddings\nT0 \u2208RN\u00d7dt, where N is the token length and dt the em-\nbedding dimension. Beginning-of-text (BOT) and end-of-\ntext (EOT) tokens, denoted b0 and e0, mark the sequence\nboundaries. These token embeddings, with positional en-\ncodings, are passed through the text encoder\u2019s L trans-\nformer layers, {Wi}L\ni=1, as follows,\n[bi, Ti, ei] = Wi([bi\u22121, Ti\u22121, ei\u22121])\ni = 1, . . . , L\nAfter the final layer, the output of the EOT token, eL, is\nprojected into the shared V-L space using Pt,\nw = Pt(eL)\nwhere w \u2208Rd.\nClassification with CLIP: With the image feature f and\ntext features {wc}C\nc=1 for C classes, CLIP calculates the\ncosine similarity between f and each wc,\nsim(f, wc) = f \u00b7 wc\n|f||wc|,\nwhere | \u00b7 | represents the L2 norm. Class probabilities are\nthen computed using the softmax function,\np(y = c | f) =\nexp(sim(f, wc)/\u03c4)\nPC\ni=1 exp(sim(f, wi)/\u03c4)\nwhere \u03c4 is a temperature parameter. The final predicted\nclass is selected as the one with the highest probability\nscore.\n3.2.\nMulti-Modal\nRepresentation\nLearning\n(MMRL)\nOur proposed MMRL aims to address the challenges of\nadapting pre-trained VLMs using few-shot data while main-\ntaining generalization to new tasks. The training and infer-\nence frameworks of MMRL are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3,\nrespectively. In the following, we describe the specifics of\nthe methodology.\n3.2.1. Learnable Representation Space\nMMRL establishes a shared, learnable representation space\nR to facilitate multimodal interactions, initialized through\nsampling from a Gaussian distribution. Using a learnable\nmapping function F(\u00b7), implemented as a linear layer, we\nproject the tokens R \u2208RK\u00d7dr in this space\u2014where K is\nthe number of tokens and dr is the dimension of the repre-\nsentation space\u2014into both visual and textual modalities,\nRv = {Rv\ni }L\u22121\ni=J\u22121\nRv\ni = Fv\ni (R)\nRt = {Rt\ni}L\u22121\ni=J\u22121\nRt\ni = Ft\ni (R)\nwhere Rv\ni \u2208RK\u00d7dv and Rt\ni \u2208RK\u00d7dt represent the rep-\nresentation tokens for visual and textual modalities, respec-\ntively, in the (i + 1)-th transformer layer. The index J in-\ndicates the starting layer from which these representation\ntokens are integrated into the encoders.\n3.2.2. Integration into Higher Encoder Layers\nTo preserve the generalized knowledge in the lower layers\nof the pre-trained CLIP model, the representation tokens Rv\nand Rt are integrated into the higher layers of the image\nencoder V and the text encoder W, beginning from the J-th\nlayer.\nFor the image encoder V,\n[ci, Ei] = Vi([ci\u22121, Ei\u22121])\ni = 1, . . . , J \u22121\n[ci, , Ei] = Vi([ci\u22121, Rv\ni\u22121, Ei\u22121])\ni = J, . . . , L \u22121\n[ci, Rv\ni , Ei] = Vi([ci\u22121, Rv\ni\u22121, Ei\u22121])\ni = L\nFor the text encoder W, while previous prompt learn-\ning [17] involves replacing parts of Ti to incorporate deep\nprompts, we retain the entire Ti and insert Rt\ni before it, aim-\ning to preserve the original textual information,\n[bi, Ti, ei] = Wi([bi\u22121, Ti\u22121, ei\u22121])\ni = 1, . . . , J \u22121\n[bi, , Ti, ei] = Wi([bi\u22121, Rt\ni\u22121, Ti\u22121, ei\u22121])\ni = J, . . . , L \u22121\n[bi, Rt\ni, Ti, ei] = Wi([bi\u22121, Rt\ni\u22121, Ti\u22121, ei\u22121])\ni = L\nNote that due to the autoregressive nature of the text en-\ncoder, we adjust the attention mask matrix to accommodate\nthe increased embedding length.\n3.2.3. Representation Learning\nRepresentation learning is designed to leverage representa-\ntion tokens for dataset-specific adaptation, while the class\ntoken preserves the pre-trained knowledge of the original\nCLIP. Through a set of strategies aimed at retaining general-\nization during both training and inference, MMRL enables\nflexible inference for different tasks, as detailed below.\n\u2022 Training Phase: We optimize the features of both the\nrepresentation tokens and the original class token, with\n4\n(a) The first part of the English PDF of case 5.\n3.

MMRL inference process, where different tasks utilize distinct features.\nthe primary focus on representation features to preserve\npre-trained knowledge. Specifically, the projection layer\nfor the representation tokens is trainable, while that for\nthe class token remains fixed. For the image encoder V,\nafter passing through L transformer layers, we obtain the\noutput cL \u2208Rdv for the class token and Rv\nL \u2208RK\u00d7dv\nfor the K representation tokens. The final output of the\nrepresentation tokens, rL, is derived by averaging across\nthe K tokens,\nrL = Mean(Rv\nL)\nwhere rL \u2208Rdv. We then apply the patch projection\nlayers to map the outputs of both the class and represen-\ntation tokens into the common V-L latent space, yielding\nthe class features fc and representation features fr.\nfc = P c\nv(cL)\nfr = P r\nv (rL)\nHere, P c\nv is the original, frozen patch projection layer of\nCLIP for class features, while P r\nv for representation fea-\ntures is trainable.\nFor the text encoder W, following the sequential nature of\ntext, we map the EOT token eL\u2014as in the original CLIP\nmodel\u2014after processing through L transformer layers\ninto the common V-L space, yielding the text features.\nw = Pt(eL)\nWith the image features fc, fr, and the text classifiers\n{wc}C\nc=1 for C classes, we apply cross-entropy loss to\nseparately optimize the class and representation features,\nLc\nce = \u2212\nC\nX\nc\nyc log p(y = c | fc)\nLr\nce = \u2212\nC\nX\nc\nyc log p(y = c | fr)\nwhere yc = 1 if the image x belongs to class c, and\nyc = 0 otherwise. To further preserve the generaliza-\ntion of class features, we maximize the cosine similarity\nbetween (fc, w) and the frozen CLIP features (f0, w0),\nexplicitly guiding the training trajectory,\nLv\ncos = 1 \u2212fc \u00b7 f0\n|fc||f0|\nLt\ncos = 1 \u22121\nC\nC\nX\nc\nwc \u00b7 wc\n0\n|wc||wc\n0|,\nThe final MMRL loss function is\nLMMRL = \u03b1Lc\nce + (1 \u2212\u03b1)Lr\nce + \u03bb(Lv\ncos + Lt\ncos)\nwhere \u03b1 controls the balance between the features, and \u03bb\nis the penalty coefficient.\n\u2022 Testing on Base Classes: For in-distribution classes seen\nduring training, we combine the dataset-specific represen-\ntation features with the class features that preserve gener-\nalizability. The probability of an in-distribution test sam-\nple x belonging to the c-th class is\np(y = c | x) = \u03b1 \u00b7 p(y = c | fc) + (1 \u2212\u03b1) \u00b7 p(y = c | fr)\nwhere fc and fr are features extracted from the class to-\nken and representation tokens, respectively.\n\u2022 Testing on Novel Classes: For classes unseen during\ntraining or for new datasets, we rely solely on the class\ntokens, which retain generalized knowledge.\np(y = c | x) = p(y = c | fc)\n4. Experiments\nDetails on implementation, datasets, and computational\ncost are provided in the Supplementary Materials.\n4.1. Tasks and Datasets\nWe conduct four core evaluations to comprehensively as-\nsess MMRL\u2019s performance: base-to-novel generalization,\ncross-dataset evaluation, domain generalization, and few-\nshot learning. Except for few-shot learning, all experiments\nutilize a 16-shot setting, i.e., only 16 training examples per\ncategory.\nBase-to-Novel Generalization: In this evaluation, dataset\nclasses are equally divided into base and novel classes. The\nmodel is trained exclusively on base classes and tested on\nboth base and novel classes, allowing us to examine its\ntransfer learning effectiveness on base classes as well as its\nability to retain the inherent generalization or zero-shot ca-\npabilities of pre-trained VLMs for novel classes. We con-\nduct this evaluation across 11 diverse image classification\ndatasets: ImageNet [7], Caltech101 [9], OxfordPets [32],\nStanfordCars [19], Flowers102 [29], Food101 [3], FGV-\nCAircraft [27], SUN397 [45], UCF101 [30], DTD [6], and\nEuroSAT [11].\n5\n(c) The second part of the Chinese PDF of case 5.\nRepresentation \nFeatures\nClass Features\nText Features\nSim\nSim\nInference on Base Classes\nClass Features\nText Features\nSim\nInference on New Tasks\n\ud835\udefc\u0d49\ud835\udc5d\u123a\ud835\udc66|\ud835\udc53\u0bd6\u123b\n\u123a1 \u0d46\ud835\udefc\u123b\u0d49\ud835\udc5d\u123a\ud835\udc66|\ud835\udc53\u0be5\u123b\n\ud835\udc5d\u123a\ud835\udc66|\ud835\udc65\u123b\n\ud835\udc5d\u123a\ud835\udc66|\ud835\udc65\u123b\nFigure 3.

(a) The BEV-Centric paradigm. (b) The\nproposed Sparse-Centric paradigm. (c) Performance and efficiency comparison between (a) and (b).\nmotion prediction and planning should consider the high-order and bidirectional interactions among\nroad agents. However, previous methods typically adopt a sequential design for motion prediction\nand planning, ignoring the impact of ego vehicle on surrounding agents. (2) Accurate prediction for\nfuture trajectories requires semantic information for scene understanding, and geometric information\nto predict future movement of agents, which is applicable to both motion prediction and planning.\nWhile these information are extracted in upstream perception tasks for surrounding agents, it is\noverlooked for ego vehicle. (3) Both motion prediction and planning are multi-modal problems with\ninherent uncertainty, but previous methods only predict deterministic trajectory for planning.\nTo this end, we propose SparseDrive, a Sparse-Centric paradigm as shown in Fig. 1b. Specifically,\nSparseDrive is composed of a symmetric sparse perception module and a parallel motion planner.\nWith the decoupled instance feature and geometric anchor as complete representation of one instance\n(a dynamic road agent or a static map element), Symmetric Sparse Perception unifies detection,\ntracking and online mapping tasks with a symmetric model architecture, learning a fully sparse\nscene representation. In Parallel Motion Planner, a semantic-and-geometric-aware ego instance is\nfirst obtained from ego instance initialization module. With the ego instance and surrounding agent\ninstances from sparse perception, motion prediction and planning are conducted simultaneously to\nget multi-modal trajectories for all road agents. To ensure the rationality and safety for planning, a\nhierarchical planning selection strategy that incorporating a collision-aware rescore module is applied\nto select the final planning trajectory from multi-modal trajectory proposals.\nWith above effective designs, SparseDrive unleashes the great potential of end-to-end autonomous\ndriving, as shown in Fig. 1c. Without bells and whistles, our base model, SparseDrive-B, greatly\nreduces the average L2 error by 19.4% (0.58m vs. 0.72m) and collision rate by 71.4% (0.06% vs.\n0.21%). Compared with previous SOTA (state-of-the-art) method UniAD[15], our small model,\nSparseDrive-S achieves superior performance among all tasks, while running 7.2\u00d7 faster for training\n(20 h vs. 144 h) and 5.0\u00d7 faster for inference (9.0 FPS vs. 1.8 FPS).\nThe main contribution of our work are summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We explore the sparse scene representation for end-to-end autonomous driving and propose a\nSparse-Centric paradigm named SparseDrive, which unifies multiple tasks with sparse instance\nrepresentation.\n\u2022 We revise the great similarity shared between motion prediction and planning, correspondingly\nleading to a parallel design for motion planner. We further propose a hierarchical planning selection\nstrategy incorporating a collision-aware rescore module to boost the planning performance.\n\u2022 On the challenging nuScenes[1] benchmark, SparseDrive surpasses previous SOTA methods in\nterms of all metrics, especially the safety-critical metric collision rate, while keeping much higher\ntraining and inference efficiency.\n2\n(a) The

For static map element, the anchor is formulated as a\npolyline with Np points:\n\b\nx0, y0, x1, y1, ..., xNp\u22121, yNp\u22121\n\t\n.\nThen all the map elements can be represented by map instance features Fm \u2208RNm\u00d7C and anchor\npolylines Lm \u2208RNm\u00d7Np\u00d72, where Nm is the number of anchor polylines.\nSparse Tracking.\nFor tracking, we follow the ID assignment process of Sparse4Dv3[33]: once\nthe detection confidence of an instance surpasses a threshold Tthresh, it is locked onto a target and\nassigned with an ID, which remains unchanged throughout temporal propagation. This tracking\nstrategy does not need any tracking constraints, resulting in an elegant and simple symmetric design\nfor sparse perception module.\n3.3\nParallel Motion Planner\nAs shown in Fig. 4, the parallel motion planner consists of three parts: ego instance initialization,\nspatial-temporal interactions and hierarchical planning selection.\nEgo Instance Initialization.\nSimilar to surrounding agents, ego vehicle is represented by ego\ninstance feature Fe \u2208R1\u00d7C and ego anchor box Be \u2208R1\u00d711. While ego feature is typically\nrandomly initialized in previous methods, we argue that the ego feature also requires rich semantic\nand geometric information for planning, similar to motion prediction. However, the instance features\nof surrounding agents are aggregated from image feature maps I, which is not feasible for ego vehicle,\nsince ego vehicle is in blind area of cameras. Thus we use the smallest feature map of front camera to\ninitialize the ego instance feature:\nFe = AveragePool(Ifront,S)\n(1)\nThere are two advantages in doing so: the smallest feature map has already encoded the semantic\ncontext of the driving scene, and the dense feature map serves as a complementary for sparse\n5\n(c) The second part of the Chinese PDF of case

  "pdfs/2508.18783v1.pdf": "Controllable Conversational Theme Detection Track at DSTC 12\nIgor Shalyminov, Hang Su, Jake Vincent, Siffi Singh, Jason Cai, James Gung, Raphael Shu, Saab Mansour\nAmazon\n{shalymin,shawnsu,jakevinc,siffis,cjinglun,gungj,zhongzhu,saabm}@amazon.com\nAbstract\nConversational analytics has been on the fore-\nfront of transformation driven by the advances\nin Speech and Natural Language Processing\ntechniques. Rapid adoption of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) in the analytics field has taken\nthe problems that can be automated to a new\nlevel of complexity and scale.\nIn this paper, we introduce Theme Detection as\na critical task in conversational analytics, aimed\nat automatically identifying and categorizing\ntopics within conversations. This process can\nsignificantly reduce the manual effort involved\nin analyzing expansive dialogs, particularly in\ndomains like customer support or sales. Unlike\ntraditional dialog intent detection, which often\nrelies on a fixed set of intents for downstream\nsystem logic, themes are intended as a direct,\nuser-facing summary of the conversation\u2019s core\ninquiry. This distinction allows for greater flex-\nibility in theme surface forms and user-specific\ncustomizations.\nWe pose Controllable Conversational Theme\nDetection problem as a public competition\ntrack at Dialog System Technology Challenge\n(DSTC) 12 \u2014 it is framed as joint cluster-\ning and theme labeling of dialog utterances,\nwith the distinctive aspect being controllabil-\nity of the resulting theme clusters\u2019 granularity\nachieved via the provided user preference data.\nWe give an overview of the problem, the asso-\nciated dataset and the evaluation metrics, both\nautomatic and human. Finally, we discuss the\nparticipant teams\u2019 submissions and provide in-\nsights from those. The track materials (data\nand code) are openly available in the GitHub\nrepository.\n1\nIntroduction\nConversational analytics \u2014 at the intersection of\nSpeech and Natural Language Processing \u2014 has\nundergone rapid transformation due to advances in\nboth fields. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)\nnow enables accurate transcription of conversations\nacross diverse domains and durations. Simultane-\nously, Natural Language Processing (especially\nInformation Retrieval) has enabled large-scale anal-\nysis of conversational data, revealing patterns such\nas word usage, emotional tone, and discussed top-\nics. More recently, Large Language Models (LLMs)\nhave elevated the complexity and quality of analy-\nsis tasks. For instance, large-scale text embedding\nmodels (Wang et al., 2024) significantly enhance\ndocument similarity search by capturing semantic\nmeaning beyond surface forms.\nIn this paper, we propose the task of Theme De-\ntection, a key problem in conversational analytics.\nThemes reflect the high-level topics discussed in\nconversations and aid in categorizing them by func-\ntion \u2014 e.g., customer support, sales, or marketing.\nAutomatically identifying and labeling themes can\ngreatly reduce the manual effort required to analyze\nlong conversations.\nWhile related to dialog intent detection, theme\ndetection serves a different purpose. Intents are\ntypically tied to a fixed schema and used for down-\nstream system logic. In contrast, themes are final\noutputs for users (e.g., analysts), summarizing the\ncustomer\u2019s inquiry and supporting diverse surface\nforms and customizations.\nWe introduce the task of Controllable Conversa-\ntional Theme Detection as a new track in the Dialog\nSystem Technology Challenge (DSTC) 12. Build-\ning on the DSTC 11 track on Open Intent Induction\n(Gung et al., 2023b), our challenge adds two major\ninnovations: (1) joint theme detection and labeling,\nand (2) controllable theme granularity. The latter\nenables customization of theme clusters based on\nuser preferences \u2014 motivated by real-world use\ncases where businesses may want finer or coarser\nthematic distinctions.\nThis task is designed for a zero-shot setting on\nunseen domains. Models will be guided by user\npreference data (detailed in Section 4) to align both\nlabels and cluster granularity. While especially\narXiv:2508.18783v1  [cs.CL]  26 Aug 2025\n\ncompelling in the context of LLMs, the proposed\nsetup does not require their use.\n2\nRelated Work\nIn this section, we discuss prior work related to the\ndistinctive aspects of our proposed task.\n2.1\nUnsupervised dialog theme / intent\ndetection\nThe task of open conversational intent induction\nwas introduced in a DSTC 11 track by Gung et al.\n(2023b), which focused on utterance clustering in\ntwo setups of varying complexity: (1) intent de-\ntection with pre-defined intentful utterances to be\nclustered, and (2) open intent induction, which re-\nquired identifying and clustering such utterances.\nIn contrast, our task involves a single setup with\npre-defined themed utterances, and the goal is to\njointly cluster and label them according to specific\nevaluation metrics. Unlike intent induction, we\ndo not restrict the surface form of theme labels.\nInstead, labels are assessed based on their structural\nquality and functional usefulness for analysis (see\nSection 6 and Appendix B).\n2.2\nControllable clustering\nOur goal of controllable theme granularity builds\non the concept of constrained clustering. A com-\nprehensive taxonomy of constraint-based cluster-\ning tasks is provided by Gonz\u00e1lez-Almagro et al.\n(2025).\nWe adopt instance-level pairwise con-\nstraints (\u201cshould-link\u201d / \u201ccannot-link\u201d), implement-\ning a semi-supervised clustering approach where\nsupervision comes from labeled utterance pairs.\nThis setup has been well-studied, from early work\nby Basu et al. (2004) to more recent approaches by\nZhang et al. (2019) and Viswanathan et al. (2024).\n2.3\nClustering with LLMs\nThe use of LLMs for utterance clustering has\ngained traction. Zhang et al. (2023) propose us-\ning hard triplets (\u201cdoes A match B better than C?\u201d)\nderived from a teacher LLM to fine-tune a smaller\nembedding model and refine clusters via a hier-\narchical method similar to HAC (Manning et al.,\n2008). While this method enables controllable clus-\ntering guided by LLMs, it focuses solely on clus-\ntering \u2014 cluster labeling remains out of scope. In\ncontrast, our task requires labeled theme clusters,\ncombining clustering with label generation to better\nreflect real-world needs.\nViswanathan et al. (2024) provide a thorough\nstudy on integrating LLMs into clustering work-\nflows. They identify three points of intervention:\n(1) pre-clustering, using LLMs to generate key-\nwords and enrich input texts; (2) during cluster-\ning, by expanding human-provided pairwise con-\nstraints; and (3) post-clustering, correcting uncer-\ntain assignments with LLM-based prompting. Al-\nthough their framework aligns well with our goals,\ntheir focus remains on clustering rather than label-\ning.\n3\nTask Description\nThe task of Controllable Conversational Theme\nDetection is defined as follows. The input data are:\n1. a dataset of conversations with some utter-\nances within them labeled as \u201cthemed\u201d (those\nconveying the customer\u2019s requests, possibly\nseveral per conversation)\n2. a set of preference pairs covering a sample\nof all the themed utterances and representing\nwhat pairs should belong to the same theme\nand which should not. \u2014 which we refer to as\n\u201cshould-link\u201d and \u201ccannot-link\u201d pairs, respec-\ntively\n3. a theme label writing guideline outlining the\nrequirements to a label as both a linguistic\nexpression and an analytical tool.\nThe goal of the task is to:\n\u2022 cluster the themed utterances so that each clus-\nter represents a meaningful semantic / the-\nmatic group, is distinguishable from other\ntheme clusters and satisfies the should-link /\ncannot-link requirements on its utterances (if\nit contains utterances included in the prefer-\nence data)\n\u2022 give each theme a short, concise and action-\nable natural language label (more detail on\nour evaluation criteria is given in Section 6).\n3.1\nControlling theme granularity\nIn the way we intend to control theme granularity,\nwe loosely follow the Stage 2 approach of Zhang\net al. 2023. That work described a data-efficient\napproach with user preference data in the should-\nlink / cannot-link form. As such, if user preferences\nindicate that the utterances \u201cI want to purchase pet\n\nA:\nhi how may I help you?\nC:\nI want to open a new account\nA:\nsure thing! Let me bring up \nyour info\n...\nA:\nhi how may I help you?\nC:\nI want to change my PIN\nA:\nabsolutely! let\u2019s start my \npulling up your info\n...\nA:\nhi how may I help you today?\nC:\nCan you help me check my \naccount balance\nA:\nI\u2019m on it, please hold on a \nsecond\n...\nThemed Utterance Clusters\nRaw conversations\nI want to open a new account\nI want to change my PIN\nCan you help me check \nmy account balance\nTheme-labeled Clusters\nopen bank account\nchange PIN\ncheck account balance\nPreference-aligned Labeled Clusters \u2605\ninquire about \nbank account\nchange PIN\nTheme Label \nGuideline\nopen bank account\ncheck account balance\nsame theme? - YES\nopen bank account\nchange PIN\nsame theme? - NO\nTheme Granularity Preferences\nFigure 1: Diagram of the proposed task in the form of an example processing pipeline. The inputs to the \u201csystem\u201d\nare raw conversations, user preferences on the theme granularity and theme label guidelines; the output is preference-\naligned utterance clusters with the corresponding theme labels (marked with \u22c6)\ninsurance\u201d and \u201cI want to purchase travel insur-\nance\u201d should belong to the same theme, all the\nutterances like these two would be associated to\nthe single theme whose label semantically unifies\nboth of the two utterances\u2019 meanings e.g. \u201cpur-\nchase insurance\u201d or some close paraphrase of it.\nOn the other hand, if the preferences elicit that \u201cI\nwant to find the closest branch\u201d and \u201cGive me the\ndirections to the closest ATM\u201d should not belong\nto the same theme, the corresponding themes \u201cfind\nbranch\u201d and \u201cfind ATM\u201d as well as the clusters of\nutterances belonging to them should be kept as sep-\narate. Some example usages of such data include\ncontrastive fine-tuning of utterance representation\nas done by e.g. Chu et al. (2023) and Zhang et al.\n(2021) or adjusting the initial clusters/themes, as\ndepicted in Figure 1.\n3.2\nExpected result\nA successful completion of the task would assume\nassigning each utterance a theme label so that:\n\u2022 theme labels are concise, exhaustively cover\nall the examples and are mutually exclusive,\n\u2022 label wording conforms to the Theme label\nwriting guideline (Appendix B),\n\u2022 theme granularity matches the \u2018gold\u2019 held-out\nassignment which is supposed to be inferred\nfrom the provided user preference samples.\nA visualization of the overall task is presented\nin Figure 1 where we depict a potential sequential\npipeline as an example. The actual submissions\ncan vary in architecture and the types of models\nused. We intend the problem to be solved in a\nzero-shot weakly supervised way, in the sense that\nall the training/development data provided to the\nparticipants has no domain overlap with the test\ndata (more detail on the data in Section 4), and\nthe only supervision signals provided are 1) user\npreference data covering a sample of the dataset\nand 2) theme label writing guideline.\nWhile the input data suggests LLM-based solu-\ntions, we encourage the participants to use tech-\nniques from both LLM-based and traditional Ma-\nchine Learning paradigms that adequately corre-\nspond to the problem specifics.\n4\nData\nWe build our task on top of the NatCS (Gung et al.,\n2023a,b), a multi-domain dataset of human-human\ncustomer support conversations \u2014 the dataset\nstatistics per domain are provided in Table 2.\nWe intend for the participants\u2019 submissions to\nwork in a zero-shot setup naturally supported\nwithin the LLM-centered framework. As such, we\nprovide the three original NatCS domains: Bank-\ning, Finance and Insurance \u2014 for the participants\nto use for the training/development purposes and as-\nsess the domain generalization of their approaches.\nOur theme labels closely resemble the original\nintent annotations in NatCS, though those were\naltered in the following ways:\n1. intent labels\u2019 surface form was rewritten\nwhere needed to conform with the theme label\nwriting guideline (see Appendix B),\n2. for each original intent label, we provide two\ntheme labels, a more specific one and a more\nvague one, for the flexibility of evaluation,\n\nTable 1: User Preference Data Statistics\nDomain\n# Should-link pairs\n% data covered\n# Cannot-link pairs\n% data covered\nBanking\n164\n10.04%\n164\n10.04%\nFinance\n173\n10%\n173\n10%\nInsurance\n155\n8.99%\n126\n7.30%\nTravel (held out)\n77\n10.07%\n76\n9.93%\nTable 2: Dialog Dataset Statistics\nDomain\n# Dialogs\n# Themed utterances\nBanking\n980\n1634\nFinance\n3000\n1725\nInsurance\n836\n1333\nTravel (held out)\n999\n765\n3. intent clustering itself was altered to reflect\nour task\u2019s custom theme granularity,\n4. some noisy intent annotations were corrected\nor otherwise dropped.\nThe held out test domain, Travel, is publicly\nreleased for the first time in this challenge and has\nlittle to no overlap with the train/dev data.\nAlso introduced in this challenge is theme gran-\nularity preference data on top of NatCS dialogs,\nits statistics are shown in Table 1. We generated\npreference pairs in the following way.\nShould-link pairs: we clustered themed utter-\nances (we leave the specifics of the clustering algo-\nrithm behind to prevent evaluation metric hacking)\nand sampled pairs that belong to the same cluster\nin the gold assignment but to the different clusters\nas per the algorithm, with sampling weights set to\nthe normalized cosine distances between the points\nin the pair (further points that should be in the same\ntheme are more interesting). Cannot-link pairs:\nsimilarly, we sampled pairs of utterances that be-\nlong to different clusters in the gold assignment\nbut to the same cluster as per the algorithm. Sam-\nple weights set to 1 \u2212dist(utta, uttb) normalized\nto make a probability distribution, where utta and\nuttb are the utterances in the pair and dist is cosine\ndistance.\nIn each case, our target amount of pairs to gener-\nate corresponds to 10% of all the themed utterances\nin the dataset, and preference pairs cover no more\nthan 30% of any given gold cluster\u2019s utterances.\n5\nBaseline and Experimental Setup\nWe provided the participants with a baseline so-\nlution that combines traditional machine learning\napproaches with LLM-based techniques. As such,\nthe entire baseline workflow consists of 3 stages:\n1. Utterance clustering.\nEach themed ut-\nterance is embedded with SentenceBERT\n(all-mpnet-base-v2 model is used,\nReimers and Gurevych 2019), then the em-\nbeddings are clustered using the K-means al-\ngorithm (Jin and Han, 2010) with 10 clus-\nters by default and the k-means++ initial-\nizer (Arthur and Vassilvitskii, 2007).\n2. Theme cluster adjustment to user prefer-\nences. We apply a na\u00efve algorithm that re-\nassigns cluster labels for every utterance id\ncontaining in the should-link / cannot-link sets.\nFor every < utti, uttj > pair in the should-\nlink set, if they are assigned to different clus-\nters, uttj is re-assigned to utti\u2019s cluster. In\nturn, for every < uttm, uttn > in the cannot-\nlink set, uttn is re-assigned to the cluster with\nthe second closest centroid to it. Evidently, the\nbaseline cluster adjustment algorithm doesn\u2019t\nhave any generalization outside of the given\npreference sets.\n3. Theme label generation. We used an LLM\nwith the prompt as in Appendix B \u2014 the de-\nfault model used in the baseline implemen-\ntation is Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3\n(Jiang et al., 2023). No limitation on the num-\nber of in-context utterances was set.\n6\nEvaluation\nTheme assignment that is the result of our task\u2019s so-\nlution can be assessed from two perspectives: from\nthe controlled clustering perspective and from the\ntheme label generation perspective \u2014 our evalua-\ntion metrics reflect these two perspectives.\n6.1\nAutomatic evaluation\nAutomatic evaluation metrics are mainly used for\nthe development purposes and were provided to the\nparticipants as part of the starter code.\n\nTable 3: Automatic Evaluation \u2014 Theme Label Metrics.

Normalization is performed over\nthe mean of the entropies of the two assign-\nments\n\u2022 ACC score (Huang et al., 2014) evaluates the\noptimal alignment between the reference clus-\nter assignment and the predicted one, with\nthe alignment obtained using the Hungarian\nalgorithm.\n6.1.2\nLabel generation metrics\nWe evaluate the predicted labels for theme clusters\nin two general ways: 1) similarity to the reference\nlabels, 2) adherence to the theme label guideline.\nSimilarity of a predicted label to the references\nis calculated in the following way:\nScorei(Yi, \u02c6yi) = max\nj\nsim(Yi,j, \u02c6yi)\nwhere Yi are the reference labels for the i-th ut-\nterance (we provide two labels with a more specific\nand a more vague wording, respectively), yi is the\npredicted label for the same utterance and sim is\none of the similarity functions listed below.\n\u2022 Cosine similarity \u2014 the semantic simi-\nlarity measure over SentenceBERT embed-\ndings (all-mpnet-base-v2 model is\nused, Reimers and Gurevych 2019) of the ref-\nerence and predicted labels,\n\u2022 ROUGE score (Lin, 2004) \u2014 an token-level\nN-gram overlap metric useful for comparing\nshort and concise word sequences,\n\u2022 BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020) combines\nthe agility of embedding-based similarity and\nthe interpretability of token-level overlap. The\nmodel tokenizes each utterance and gener-\nates a contextual embedding for each token.\nThen, a cosine similarity simi,j is calculated\nbetween i-th token of the reference and j-th to-\nken of the prediction. We report BERTScore\nPrecision (for each token in the prediction,\nfinding the reference token with the highest\nsimilarity), Recall (for each token in the ref-\nerence, finding the prediction token with the\nhighest similarity) and F1 score.\nAdherence to the guideline is evaluated with an\nLLM-as-a-Judge prompted with a version of the\nguideline attached in the Appendix B (it was pro-\nvided for the participants). For the usage with the\nLLM, it was split into three sections spanning struc-\ntural and functional criteria, i.e. how good the label\nis as a linguistic expression and how good it is as\nan analytical tool, respectively. For the sake of\npreventing evaluation metric hacking, we shared\na different / condensed version of the guideline\nto the participants and kept the full version held\nout. For evaluation during the development phase,\nour provided code used a self-hosted solution with\nvicuna-13b-v1.5 (Zheng et al., 2023) as the\ndefault LLMaaJ backbone. In the automatic evalu-\nation of the final submissions, we used Claude 3.5\nSonnet (Anthropic, 2024). Our repository contains\nboth the public version of the label style evaluation\nprompt (3 condensed sections optimized for usage\nwith public self-hosted LLMs) and its held out ver-\nsion (2 expanded sections optimized for usage with\nClaude, uploaded after the end of the competition).\n6.2\nHuman Evaluation\nAll submissions underwent expert human evalua-\ntion in order to verify automated evaluation results\n\nand to expand the automated evaluation methodol-\nogy to more precisely assess each solution\u2019s perfor-\nmance. The evaluation dimensions were divided\ninto two broad categories covering formal and func-\ntional criteria, and each of these areas had addi-\ntional subdimensions to be rated by evaluators in a\nbinary fashion (pass/fail) using criteria distributed\ninto into two broad categories: Structural/Func-\ntional. The structural criteria were based on the\ntheme labeling guidelines provided to participants.\nStructural Criteria (Theme Label as a Linguistic\nExpression): Conciseness & Word Choice, Gram-\nmatical Structure\nFunctional Criteria1 (Theme Label as an Analyti-\ncal Tool): Semantic Relevance, Analytical Utility,\nGranularity, Actionability, Domain Relevance, The-\nmatic Distinctiveness.\nThe guidelines for each of these dimensions,\nalong with the positive and negative examples pro-\nvided to evaluators (with reasoning), are laid out in\nAppendix C. The theme labeling guidelines, upon\nwhich the structural criteria were based, are defined\nin Appendix B. The annotation task was completed\nin a single-pass way by two members of the track\norganizing team.\n7\nResults and Analysis\nTable 6: Automatic Evaluation \u2014 Clustering Metrics\nTeam ID\nACC\nNMI\nTeam A\n48.37%\n42.02%\nTeam B\n17.91%\n1.97%\nTeam C\n67.97%\n70.39%\nTeam D\n51.76%\n47.71%\nTeam E\n35.82%\n47.73%\nTeam F\n26.67%\n9.06%\nBaseline\n53.2%\n50.59%\nBL-prefs\n47.97%\n45.39%\nWe received submissions from 6 participant teams.\nDuring the development, the teams were free to\nuse the provided public data across 3 domains for\ncreating their own train / development setups and\ntesting e.g. out-of-domain generalization of their\napproaches.

Team\nE trained a reward model from the should-link and\ncannot-link pairs that was later incorporated into\nthe clustering algorithm to impose soft constraints.\nDid you use the theme label styleguide \u2014 if yes,\nhow?\nTeam C used General Schema to extract verbs and\nnouns for each utterance in the cluster, then using\nthose, they generated theme labels. Theme D in-\nstructed the labeling LLM to generate Verb-Object\npairs. Teams E and F used the provided styleguide\nitself. Team F added it directly into the labeling\nLLM\u2019s prompt, and Team E modified and simpli-\nfied it first.\nShort (1-2 paragraph) description of your ap-\nproach\nTeam A proposed a cluster-then-label framework\nfor thematic clustering of utterances. First, they\ncompute utterance embeddings using either Sen-\ntence Transformers, InBedder, or Instructor models\ndepending on the embedding type. they then apply\nclustering (KMeans or HDBSCAN with UMAP-\nbased dimensionality reduction) to group themat-\nically similar utterances. Clustering is refined us-\ning manually provided should-link and cannot-link\npreference pairs, ensuring better alignment with\nhuman notions of similarity. After clustering, each\ncluster is labeled automatically by prompting an\nLLM (ChatGPT or Gemini Flash) with a batch of\nutterances, extracting a theme label and brief expla-\nnation. The resulting predicted labels are assigned\nback to utterances, forming the final output for eval-\nuation. This approach leverages both unsupervised\nstructure discovery and lightweight LLM-based\nsupervision for scalable and interpretable theme\nlabeling.\nTeam B used SCCL (Zhang et al., 2021) and ap-\nplied SimCSE for data augmentation. After train-\ning the SCCL, they clustered the utterances with\nK-Means. They performed hyperparameter search\nfor the number of clusters based on the Silhouette\nscore and set it to 7. User preference data was not\nused.\nTeam C first extracted keyphrases from conversa-\ntions using an LLM. They also determined the num-\nbers of clusters based on the Silhouette coefficient.\nClustering was performed using ClusterLLM, and\nthe embedder was fine-tuned on the clustered ut-\nterances. Subsequently, among the two candidates\nwith the highest preference pair accuracy, the can-\ndidate with the greater number of clusters was se-\nlected as the final model. Utterances were then\nadjusted according to the preference pairs. Finally,\n\nfor the clustered utterances, a general schema was\nextracted in terms of verbs and nouns, and based\non both the schema and the utterance content, the\nfinal theme labels were generated.\nTeam D explored two approaches.\nThe first\none involved designing a prompting strategy to\ngenerate concise labels in a Verb\u2013Object for-\nmat (e.g., \u201cupdate address\u201d, \u201cbook flight\u201d),\nallowing for more structured and comparable\ncluster representations.\nThe second approach\nused LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to evaluate\nwhether two utterances (with dialog history) be-\nlonged to the same cluster, based on their distance\nfrom the cluster center. The second method showed\nlimited performance, and they submitted results\nusing the first one, with a more robust prompting-\nbased labeling strategy.\nTeam E propose PrefSegGen, a preference-aware\ntopic segmentation and generation framework\nthat addresses low-resource conversational theme\nunderstanding by integrating topical-structured\ncontext modeling with user-preference-aligned\ntheme generation.\nFirst,\nthey introduce a\nnovel two-stage self-supervised contrastive learn-\ning topic segmentation framework to obtain the\ntopic segment to which the target utterance be-\nlongs under low-resource conditions.\nIt ini-\ntially leverages the unlabeled dialogues to pre-\ntrain topic encoders (bert-base-uncased &\nsup-simcse-bert-base-uncased) on co-\nherence and similarity patterns, followed by super-\nvised fine-tuning with minimal labeled data to en-\nhance segmentation precision. Subsequently, they\nincorporate a reward-guided clustering mechanism\nto guarantee that the generated themes are both\ncontextually grounded and preference-aligned. A\nreward model, trained on should-link and cannot-\nlink pairs, dynamically assigns linkage weights\nthat reflect semantic proximity in line with user\nexpectations. These weights guide spectral clus-\ntering after UMAP-based embedding reduction.\nCrucially, for each target utterance, they utilize its\nsegmented topical context as input when prompt-\ning LLaMA3-8B-Instruct, coupled with the\nofficial style guide, to generate hierarchical theme\nlabels. An ensemble refinement process further en-\nhances topic consistency by filtering low-frequency\nlabels, yielding final outputs that are structurally\ncoherent, context-aware, and tailored to user pref-\nerences.\nTeam F employed a large language model (LLM)\nto annotate utterances based on preference signals,\nand subsequently attempted to merge clusters ac-\ncording to the LLM-based annotation.\nOur evaluation results reveal that Team C\u2019s ap-\nproach achieved the highest accuracy across the\nboard on both human and automatic metrics. It\nwas tied with Team B on Label Conciseness, and\nwith Teams A and F on Grammatical Structure.\nAlthough only Team C\u2019s approach achieves 100%\non both, signifying that its label generation works\nin full accordance with the styleguide. Team C\nwas also the only one to surpass the baseline on\nautomatic clustering metrics. Team E achieved the\nsecond best overall performance in both automatic\nand human evaluation and Team D placed third.\nIt is noteworthy that for all the three winning\nplaces, the ranking induced by the automatic met-\nrics matched that by the humans \u2014 indicating that\n1) automatic similarity metrics are applicable for\nshort text, and 2) automatic evaluation of higher-\nlevel concepts like our label guideline is sufficiently\naccurate with frontier LLMs-as-Judges.\n8\nConclusions\nIn this paper, we introduced Theme Detection as\na critical task in conversational analytics, and the\nassociated Controllable Conversational Theme De-\ntection competition track at Dialog System Tech-\nnology Challenge (DSTC) 12 \u2014 where joint theme\nclustering and cluster label generation was further\ncombined with the custom theme cluster granular-\nity controllable via the provided preference data.\nWe gave an overview of the competition setup\nincluding the problem, the benchmark dataset and\nthe details of evaluation, both automatic and human.\nWe presented the participant team\u2019s submissions\nand gave an analysis of the insights from those.\nWe hope that this new problem, together with the\ndataset and the insights obtained from the competi-\ntion will foster further research and advancements\nin Conversational AI.\n9\nAcknowledgements\nWe express our deep gratitude to Dr. Daniel Good-\nhue for his assistance at the final submission evalu-\nation stage.\n\nReferences\nAnthropic. 2024.\nIntroducing Claude 3.5 Son-\nnet.\nhttps://www.anthropic.com/news/\nclaude-3-5-sonnet.

Structurally well-formed\nmeans that the words and their arrangement in\nthe theme label are acceptable. Semantically well-\nformed means that the meaning and usability of the\ntheme label are acceptable.\nB.1\nTheme labels exclude unneeded and\nundesirable words.\nTheme labels should be concise (2\u20135 words long).\nThey should only include essential words (see B.2\nand B.2.1 below). Essential words will primar-\nily include content (open-class) words. Function\n(closed-class) words should be excluded. Prepo-\nsitions may be included as needed but should be\navoided when there is a synonymous alternative\nlabel without a preposition.\nTheme labels should also exclude context-\nsensitive words like pronouns (him, her, them, it,\nus, etc.) and demonstratives (this, that, those, etc.).\nB.2\nWord types\n\u2022 Content/open-class words:\n\u2013 nouns (items, insurance, information, or-\nder, etc.)\n\u2013 main verbs (check, inquire, add, explore,\netc.)\n\u2013 adjectives (new patient, missing item,\netc.)\n\u2013 other modifying words (shipping infor-\nmation, product options, etc.)\n\u2022 Function/closed-class words:\n\u2013 articles/determiners (the, a, etc.)\n\u2013 auxiliary verbs (have or be, as in I have\neaten or I am eating)\n\u2013 copulas\n\u2013 negation (not or -n\u2019t, as in not on time or\ndidn\u2019t arrive)\n\n\u2013 conjunctions (and, or, but, etc.)\n\u2013 complementizers\n(clause-embedding\nuses of that, for, if, whether, because,\netc.)\n\u2013 modals (can, could, will, would, may,\nmight, must, shall)\n\u2013 question words (who, what, where, when,\nhow, why)\n\u2022 Context-sensitive words:\n\u2013 pronouns (she, he, they, it, her, his, etc.)\n\u2013 demonstratives (this, these, that, those,\netc.)\n\u2013 temporal adverbs (yesterday, tomorrow,\nnext week, etc.)\n\u2013 other context-sensitive language\n* one, as in I\u2019m looking for a nearby\nbranch. Can you find one?\n* deleted nouns (noun ellipsis), as in I\nfound his order, but not yours __.\nB.2.1\nExamples\nFor a theme covering order tracking:\n\u2022 Good: track order\n\u2022 Good: track shipment\n\u2022 Bad: track an order (includes an article)\n\u2022 Bad: track their order (includes a pronoun)\nFor a theme covering finding the nearest branch\nof a chain:\n\u2022 Good: find nearest branch\n\u2022 Good: find closest branch\n\u2022 Bad:\nfind nearest one (includes context-\nsensitive one)\n\u2022 Bad: check if there\u2019s a nearby branch (in-\ncludes a complementizer if; includes a form\nof be)\nB.3\nTheme labels are verb phrases that\nclassify events.\nA verb phrase begins with a verb and may include\narguments or modifiers of the verb (such as a direct\nobject). The verb should be in its citation form,\nlacking any complex morphology such as tense or\nagreement suffixes. The citation form of a verb is\nwhat would normally follow the infinitive to, such\nas sign up in I\u2019d like to sign up. Theme labels\nshould not be other phrase types, such as noun\nphrases.\nThe verb phrase should describe a class of events.\nEvents are things that can be said to happen, unlike\nstates (e.g. learn [event] vs. know [state]), entities\n(e.g. redeem [event] vs. redemption [entity]), prop-\nerties (e.g. complain [event] vs. angry [property]),\nand claims (report defect [event] vs. product is\ndefective [claim]).\nB.3.1\nExamples\nFor a theme covering membership sign-ups:\n\u2022 Good: sign up for membership (verb phrase;\ndescribes a kind of signing up event)\n\u2022 Bad: signing up for membership (verb phrase,\nbut verb is not in citation form)\n\u2022 Bad: membership sign-up (noun phrase; de-\nscribes a kind of entity)\n\u2022 Bad: memberships (noun phrase; describes a\nkind of entity)\nFor a theme covering requests to check in early at\na hotel:\n\u2022 Good: request early check-in (verb phrase;\ndescribes a kind of requesting event)\n\u2022 Bad: requested early check-in (verb phrase,\nbut verb is not in citation form)\n\u2022 Bad: request for early check-in (noun phrase;\ndescribes a kind of entity)\n\u2022 Bad: customer wants early check-in (this is a\nclaim)\nFor a theme covering reporting a defective product:\n\u2022 Good: report defective product (verb phrase;\ndescribes events)\n\u2022 Bad: reporting defective product (verb phrase,\nbut verb is not in citation form)\n\u2022 Bad: believe product is defective (verb phrase,\nbut describes a state rather than an event)\n\u2022 Bad: defective product (noun phrase; de-\nscribes a kind of entity)\n\nB.4\nTheme labels are informative and\nactionable yet sufficiently general.\nTheme labels should be informative enough to sub-\nstantially narrow down the set of possible customer\nissue resolution steps (the steps to resolve the prob-\nlem/need that drove the customer to make contact).\nFor example, check balance is probably associated\nwith a standard procedure for checking the balance\nof a range of customer account types, but perform\ncheck is so broad that it could be associated with an\nextremely diverse group of issue resolutions. Non-\nactionable theme labels may be excessively vague\nor uninformative, and hence not very useful.\nB.4.1\nExamples\nFor a theme covering appointment-scheduling\nthemes:\n\u2022 Good: schedule appointments\n\u2022 Bad: ask about appointments (probably too\ngeneral)\n\u2022 Bad: schedule appointment for next week (too\nspecific)\n\u2022 Bad: schedule appointment for elderly parent\n(too specific)\nFor a theme covering adding a recognized user to\nan existing account or policy:\n\u2022 Good: add user\n\u2022 Bad: add one (too general)\n\u2022 Bad: add oldest child (too specific)\nFor a theme covering user password issues:\n\u2022 Good: reset password\n\u2022 Good: troubleshoot password\n\u2022 Bad: secure account (too general)\n\u2022 Bad: reset password again (too specific)\nFor a theme covering credit or debit card charge\ndisputes:\n\u2022 Good: dispute charge\n\u2022 Bad: complain about charge (too general)\n\u2022 Bad: file card complaint (too general)\n\u2022 Bad: dispute charge for defective blender (too\nspecific)\nC\nHuman Evaluation Guidelines\nC.1\nStructural Dimensions\nC.1.1\nConciseness & Word Choice\nOptions: Pass (1) / Fail (0)\nDefinition: The following criteria are consolidated\nby the evaluator into one Pass/Fail rating for Con-\nciseness & Word Choice:\n1. Label length: Is the label concise, containing\nonly 2\u20135 words?\n\u2022 Pass: update billing address\nFail:\nupdate customer\u2019s residential\nbilling address for future statements\nRationale: The good example uses 3\nwords, within the required 2-5 word\nrange. The bad example uses 8, making\nit unnecessarily verbose when the core\nintent can be expressed more concisely.\n\u2022 Pass: access account statement\nFail: statement\nRationale: The good example uses 3\nwords, adhering to the 2-5 word guide-\nline. The bad example uses only one\nword, which lacks sufficient specificity\nto be useful as a theme label.\n2. Function word exclusion: Does the label\nexclude unnecessary function words (articles,\nauxiliary verbs, etc.)?\n\u2022 Pass: add dependent coverage\nFail: add the dependent to coverage\nRationale: The good example correctly\nexcludes function words like articles\n(\u201cthe\u201d), focusing only on essential con-\ntent words. The bad example unneces-\nsarily includes \u201cthe\u201d, which should be\nexcluded according to guidelines.\n\u2022 Pass: troubleshoot internet connection\nFail: troubleshoot why internet is not\nworking\nRationale:\nThe good example prop-\nerly excludes function words, while the\nbad example improperly includes func-\ntion words \u201cwhy,\u201d \u201cis,\u201d and \u201cnot\u201d which\nshould be excluded for conciseness.\n3. Avoidance of context sensitivity:\nDoes\nthe label exclude context-dependent words\n(pronouns, demonstratives, temporal adverbs,\netc.)?\n\n\u2022 Pass: return defective product\nFail: return this item\nRationale: The good example avoids\ncontext-sensitive words like \u201cthis\u201d and\nuses the general term \u201cproduct\u201d that can\napply across contexts. The bad exam-\nple includes the context-sensitive demon-\nstrative \u201cthis,\u201d which requires a specific\ncontext to understand its meaning.\n\u2022 Pass: reschedule appointment\nFail: reschedule it for tomorrow\nRationale: The good example uses gen-\neral terminology applicable to any ap-\npointment, while the bad example in-\ncludes both the pronoun \u201cit\u201d and the tem-\nporal adverb \u201ctomorrow,\u201d both of which\nare dependent on conversation context\nfor their meaning.\n4. Preposition usage: Are prepositions included\nonly when necessary?\n\u2022 Pass: transfer funds\nFail: transfer from account\nRationale: The good example avoids un-\nnecessary prepositions by using a con-\ncise verb-object structure. The bad ex-\nample unnecessarily includes the prepo-\nsition \u201cfrom\u201d when the more concise al-\nternative without the preposition works\njust as well.\n\u2022 Pass: join rewards program\nFail: sign up for rewards program\nRationale: The good example avoids\nprepositions entirely, while the bad ex-\nample unnecessarily includes the prepo-\nsition \u201cfor\u201d when alternatives without\nprepositions are available and equally\nclear.\nC.1.2\nGrammatical Structure\nOptions: Pass (1) / Fail (0)\nDefinition: The following criteria are consolidated\nby the evaluator into one Pass/Fail rating for Gram-\nmatical Structure:\n1. Verb phrase structure: Is the label a verb\nphrase?\n\u2022 Pass: cancel flight\nFail: flight cancellation\nRationale: The good example correctly\nfollows the verb phrase requirement by\nstarting with a verb (\u201ccancel\u201d) followed\nby a noun (\u201cflight\u201d). The bad example\nuses a noun phrase (\u201cflight cancellation\u201d)\ninstead.\n\u2022 Pass: redeem rewards\nFail: rewards redemption process\nRationale: The good example uses a\nverb phrase beginning with the verb \u201cre-\ndeem\u201d. The bad example fails by using\na noun phrase with \u201credemption\u201d as the\nhead noun rather than using a verb form.\n2. Citation form: Does the verb appear in its ci-\ntation form (without tense or agreement mor-\nphology)?\n\u2022 Pass: change delivery address\nFail: changing delivery address\nRationale:\nThe good example cor-\nrectly uses the citation form of the verb\n\u201cchange\u201d without any tense or agreement\nmorphology. The bad example fails by\nusing the -ing form \u201cchanging\u201d rather\nthan the required base form.\n\u2022 Pass: cancel subscription\nFail: canceled subscription\nRationale: The good example properly\nuses the citation form of the verb \u201ccancel\u201d\nwithout inflectional endings. The bad\nexample incorrectly uses the past tense\nform \u201ccancelled\u201d instead of the citation\nform.\n3. Event classification: Does the verb phrase\ndescribe a class of events, rather than states,\nentities, properties, or claims?\n\u2022 Pass: verify warranty coverage\nFail: warranty coverage\nRationale: The good example describes\nan event (the act of verifying) rather than\nan entity. The bad example describes\nan entity (the warranty coverage itself)\nrather than an event, violating the require-\nment that theme labels classify events.\nNote: The bad example would also be\nruled out by the verb phrase requirement.\n\u2022 Pass: express dissatisfaction\nFail: customer is dissatisfied\nFail: is dissatisfied\nRationale: The good example describes\nan event (the act of expressing) rather\nthan a state. The first bad example is\n\nstructured as a claim about the customer,\nrather than describing en event. The sec-\nond bad example is a verb phrase but\ndescribes the wrong kind of situation: a\nstate, rather than an event.\n\u2022 Pass: complain about faulty product\n(event)\nFail: angry about faulty product (prop-\nerty)\nRationale: The good example describes\nan event (the act of complaining) rather\nthan a property. The bad example de-\nscribes a property or attribute of the cus-\ntomer, rather than an event describing the\ncustomer\u2019s intent.\nC.2\nFunctional Dimensions\nC.2.1\nSemantic Relevance\nOptions: Pass (1) / Fail (0)\nDefinition: Does the label accurately capture the\ncore intent/topic of the utterance it represents?\nTheme labels are expected to provide a gist of the\ndialogue from the customer\u2019s inquiry perspective.\n\u2022 Pass: request card security support (For cus-\ntomer utterance: \u201cI received a notification that\nmy credit card might have been compromised.\nI need to know what steps I should take.\u201d)\nRationale: This theme label demonstrates\ngood semantic relevance by accurately cap-\nturing the core intent of the customer\u2019s in-\nquiry\u2014addressing a potential security is-\nsue\u2014rather than focusing on peripheral as-\npects like the notification itself.\n\u2022 Fail: express frustration (For customer utter-\nance: \u201cI\u2019ve been on hold for 45 minutes trying\nto get help with activating my new debit card.\nThis is ridiculous!\u201d)\nRationale: This theme label fails the seman-\ntic relevance test because it focuses on the\ncustomer\u2019s emotional state rather than their\nactual intent, which is to activate their debit\ncard. The frustration is secondary to the core\npurpose of the contact.\n\u2022 Pass: book accommodation\nFail: inquire about Chicago\nRationale: The good example correctly iden-\ntifies the core intent (booking a hotel room),\nwhile the bad example misidentifies the intent\nas seeking information about Chicago when\nthe location is just a detail/slot related to the\nbooking request.\nC.2.2\nAnalytical Utility\nOptions: Pass (1) / Fail (0)\nDefinition: Does the label provide meaningful cat-\negorization that could directly support a reviewer\nor analyst\u2019s workflow when reviewing conversation\ndata? Themes, which should be ready for presenta-\ntion to the user/analyst, are supposed to highlight\nthe topics discussed in the conversation that are\nuseful for categorizing and further analyzing them\naccording to the nature of the conversation.\n\u2022 Pass: troubleshoot checkout error\nFor customer utterance: \u201cI\u2019m getting error\ncode E-503 when trying to complete my pur-\nchase on your website. I\u2019ve tried three differ-\nent browsers.\u201d\nRationale: This theme label has good analyti-\ncal utility because it categorizes the issue in a\nway that would allow analysts to, e.g., identify\npatterns in checkout problems, prioritize tech-\nnical fixes, and track the frequency of specific\nerror types.\n\u2022 Fail: customer contact\nFor customer utterance: \u201cI ordered a blue\nshirt in size medium last week, but you sent\nme a red one instead. I\u2019d like to exchange it.\u201d\nRationale: This theme label lacks analyti-\ncal utility because it\u2019s too broad to provide\nmeaningful categorization. It fails to identify\nthe specific issue (there\u2019s an order fulfillment\nerror) in a way that could help improve opera-\ntions or track problem patterns.\n\u2022 Pass: downgrade service plan\nFail: smart thermostat model TH8000 connec-\ntion failure with iOS app version 3.2.1\nRationale: The good example provides use-\nful categorization at the right level of detail\nfor business analysis. The bad example is\ntoo specific with technical details that would\nfragment similar issues into tiny categories,\nmaking pattern identification difficult.\nC.2.3\nGranularity\nOptions: Pass (1) / Fail (0)\nDefinition: Does the label maintain appropriate\nspecificity, as determined by its closeness to the\nprovided gold labels? (Submission authors are ex-\npected to infer ideal granularity from the provided\nuser preference data.)\n\n\u2022 Pass: update payment information\nFail: manage account\nRationale: The good example demonstrates\nappropriate granularity by categorizing the\nissue at a level that\u2019s neither too broad nor\ntoo specific. The bad example is too broad,\ngrouping potentially diverse issues that would\nbenefit from more specific categorization.\n\u2022 Pass: troubleshoot device connectivity\nFail:\nresolve Sony WH-1000XM4 head-\nphones pairing failure with streaming app on\nAndroid 16 beta\nRationale: The good example shows appro-\npriate granularity by categorizing at a level\nthat groups similar technical problems. The\nbad example has excessive granularity, in-\ncluding specific device models and OS ver-\nsions that would create overly-fragmented cat-\negories.\nC.2.4\nActionability\nOptions: Pass (1) / Fail (0)\nDefinition: Does the label provide sufficient in-\nformation to categorize customer issues for resolu-\ntion? Theme labels should be informative enough\nto substantially narrow down the set of possible\ncustomer issue resolution steps.\n\u2022 Pass: dispute transaction\nFail: seek assistance\nRationale: The good example demonstrates\ngood actionability by clearly identifying a spe-\ncific process (transaction dispute) with estab-\nlished resolution procedures. The bad exam-\nple is too vague to suggest any specific resolu-\ntion path.\n\u2022 Pass: trace missing shipment\nFail: discuss app features\nRationale: The good example shows good\nactionability by identifying a specific issue\n(shipment tracking problem) that points to\nclear resolution steps. The bad example has\npoor actionability because \u201cdiscuss\u201d doesn\u2019t\npoint to a specific resolution-related action,\nand \u201capp features\u201d is too broad.\nC.2.5\nDomain Relevance\nOptions: Pass (1) / Fail (0)\nDefinition: Does the label reflect domain-specific\nterminology and concepts appropriate to the con-\nversation context? Theme labels should reduce\nmanual analysis by utilizing domain-relevant and\ncontext-relevant terminology.\n\u2022 Pass: verify coverage details\nFor customer utterance: \u201cI need to know if\nmy insurance policy covers damage from a\nburst pipe in my basement.\u201d\nRationale: This theme label demonstrates\ngood domain relevance by using terminology\n(\u201cverify coverage\u201d) that\u2019s specific to the in-\nsurance industry and reflects how claims and\npolicy questions are typically categorized in\nthat domain.\n\u2022 Pass: transfer prescription\nFor customer utterance: \u201cI want to trans-\nfer my prescription from my old pharmacy to\nyour location. Can you help with that?\u201d\nRationale: This theme label shows good do-\nmain relevance by using standard pharmacy\nindustry terminology (\u201ctransfer prescription\u201d)\nthat accurately reflects how this process is\ncategorized and handled within the health-\ncare/pharmacy domain.\n\u2022 Fail: change money amount\nFor customer utterance: \u201cI need to increase\nmy 401(k) contribution percentage starting\nwith my next paycheck.\u201d\nRationale: This theme label lacks domain rel-\nevance because it uses overly-generic termi-\nnology instead of financial industry-specific\nlanguage.\nA more domain-relevant label\nwould be \u201cadjust retirement contribution\u201d or\n\u201cmodify investment allocation.\u201d\n\u2022 Fail: fix travel problem\nFor customer utterance: \u201cMy flight was de-\nlayed and I missed my connection. I need to\nbe rebooked on the next available flight.\u201d)\nRationale: This theme label has poor domain\nrelevance because it doesn\u2019t use airline in-\ndustry terminology. A more domain-relevant\nlabel would be \u201crebook missed connection\u201d,\n\u201caccommodate disrupted itinerary\u201d, etc.\nC.2.6\nThematic Distinctiveness\nOptions: Pass (1) / Fail (0)\nDefinition: Does the label create a clear boundary\nthat differentiates one theme from the other themes\nin the dataset? Theme labels should exhaustively\ncover all the examples AND be mutually exclusive.\n\n\u2022 Pass: report stolen card\nIn this context: Dataset already contains\ntheme labels \u201creport lost card\u201d and \u201creport\nfraudulent transaction\u201d\nFor customer utterance: \u201cSomeone stole my\nwallet and I need to block my credit card im-\nmediately.\u201d\nRationale: This theme label demonstrates\ngood thematic distinctiveness by creating a\nclear boundary between related but distinct is-\nsues: lost cards (misplaced by owner), stolen\ncards (taken by someone else), and fraudulent\ntransactions (unauthorized use).\u2019\n\u2022 Fail: inquire about refund\nIn this context: Dataset already contains\ntheme label \u201crequest refund\u201d\nFor customer utterance: \u201cI returned my pur-\nchase last week but haven\u2019t seen the money\nback in my account yet.\u201d\nRationale: This theme label fails the thematic\ndistinctiveness test because it doesn\u2019t create a\nclear boundary between refund requests and\nrefund status checks. The new utterance is\nabout tracking a refund in progress, which\nshould be a distinct category (e.g. \u201ccheck re-\nfund status\u201d. Instead, this category could be\ncompatible with utterances that are already\ncovered by \u201crequest refund\u201d.\n\u2022 Pass: change delivery location\nFail: reset account\nIn this context: Dataset already contains\ntheme labels \u201cschedule delivery\u201d, \u201cresched-\nule delivery\u201d, \u201creset password\u201d, and \u201cupdate\naccount information\u201d\nRationale: The good example shows appro-\npriate thematic distinctiveness by creating\na clear boundary between different delivery\nmodification types. The bad example blurs the\nboundary between password resets and other\nprofile updates, creating confusion about cate-\ngorization.\nD\nInput/Output Data Examples\nBelow is an input datapoint for a dialogue with\none utterance marked as themed.

  "pdfs/2508.18780v1.pdf": "Harnessing Rule-Based Reinforcement Learning for Enhanced Grammatical\nError Correction\nYilin Li1, Xunjian Yin1, Yilin Chen2, Xiaojun Wan1*\n1Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology, Peking University\n2School of Computer Science & Key Lab of High Confidence Software Technologies (MOE), Peking University\nliyilin25@stu.pku.edu.cn\nAbstract\nGrammatical error correction is a significant task in NLP.\nTraditional methods based on encoder-decoder models have\nachieved certain success, but the application of LLMs in this\nfield is still underexplored. Current research predominantly\nrelies on supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs to directly gen-\nerate the corrected sentence, which limits the model\u2019s power-\nful reasoning ability. To address this limitation, we propose\na novel framework based on Rule-Based RL. Through exper-\niments on the Chinese datasets, our Rule-Based RL frame-\nwork achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a notable\nincrease in recall. This result clearly highlights the advan-\ntages of using RL to steer LLMs, offering a more controllable\nand reliable paradigm for future development in GEC.\nIntroduction\nGrammatical Error Correction (GEC) (Bryant et al. 2023) is\na fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP)\nfocused on the automatic detection and correction of gram-\nmatical errors in text. This task is essential not only for im-\nproving text quality but also for supporting applications such\nas language learning and automated writing evaluation. Over\nthe years, numerous models have been developed to address\nGEC, including the Transformer model (Junczys-Dowmunt\net al. 2018), BERT (Kaneko et al. 2020), and T5 (Rothe et al.\n2021). Qorib, Na, and Ng (2022) combines these models and\ngenerates better corrections.\nThe advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has\nmarkedly advanced the field of NLP. Models such as GPT\nand LLaMA(OpenAI et al. 2024a; Grattafiori et al. 2024)\nhave demonstrated remarkable performance and potential\nin various NLP tasks, attributable to their ability to discern\ncomplex syntactic, semantic, and contextual patterns. Con-\nsiderable research has investigated the potential of LLMs in\nGEC. Fang et al. (2023) and Loem et al. (2023) have exam-\nined the performance of large language models in the GEC\ntask, demonstrating that LLMs possess strong capabilities in\ncapturing syntactic and semantic nuances.\nHowever, initial studies suggest that these LLMs struggle\nto surpass traditional Seq2Seq models on the GEC task(Qu,\nTang, and Wu 2025; Zhang et al. 2023; Yang and Quan\n2024). One prominent issue is overcorrection, where gram-\nmatically correct text segments are unnecessarily modified,\n*Corresponding author.\nStructural Consistency\nFluency\nTransformer-based model\nLLM\nSeq2Seq model\nGEC-Agent\nFigure 1: Traditional Seq2Seq and transformer-based mod-\nels with supervised learning in GEC task prioritize precision,\nmaking fewer corrections to sentence structure. In contrast,\nLLMs emphasize grammar and fluency, leading to deeper\ncorrections but often causing over-correction.\nthereby compromising the integrity of the original sentence.\nAs shown in Figure 1, traditional methods with supervised\nlearning can carefully ensure consistency in the form of in-\nput and output text but often lead to missed error correc-\ntions, whereas large models tend to ambitiously overcorrect\nto make sentences fluent. Simple prompting techniques fail\nto ensure that LLMs remain faithful to the original text, lead-\ning to a trade-off between fluency and structural fidelity(Sun\nand Wang 2022).\nTable 1 provides an example of overcorrection, highlight-\ning how an LLM introduces unnecessary modifications to a\nsentence.\nThe prevailing strategy among researchers is to treat\nLLMs as generative models, employing Supervised Fine-\nTuning (SFT) to enable them to produce corrected sen-\ntences directly. However, this approach may not fully har-\nness the inherent reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Efforts to\nintegrate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into LLMs for\nGEC have been explored, yet these often lead to issues such\nas hallucinations, deviations from task instructions, and a\nheightened risk of overcorrection. According to Fang et al.\n(2023), CoT has proven less effective, possibly due to the\narXiv:2508.18780v1  [cs.CL]  26 Aug 2025\n\nDescription\nSentence\nSource Sentence\nMy advice to any one start learn this sport to become carefully...\nOne Possible\nStandard Answer.\nMy advice to anyone starting learning this sport is to become\ncareful...\nLLM\nMy advice to anyone who is starting to learn this sport is to be\ncareful...\nTable 1: An example demonstrating the overcorrection by large language models shows that when faced with a sentence with\ngrammatical error, LLMs make unnecessary adjustments to the original sentence for issues like fluency. This may even bring\nthe risk of changing the meaning of the sentence.\ninsufficient reasoning capacity of LLMs to address the in-\ntricacies of GEC. Simply embedding reasoning techniques\nlike CoT does not mitigate these shortcomings, as even\nthe most advanced models\u2014both open-source and propri-\netary\u2014struggle to identify errors in challenging sentences.\nRecent developments, such as the introduction of Ope-\nnAI\u2019s O1(OpenAI et al. 2024b) and DeepSeek\u2019s R1(Guo\net al. 2025), have bolstered the reasoning abilities of LLMs.\nSimultaneously, research interest in long reasoning and rule-\nbased reward mechanisms within reinforcement learning has\nsurged. This paper investigates the integration of rule-based\nrewards into GEC. We also assess the performance of the\nDeepSeek R1 and other reasoning models on GEC tasks. Us-\ning DeepSeek R1, we generated training data enriched with\nextended reasoning processes. Subsequently, we fine-tuned\nthe model with supervised learning on this data, followed by\nreinforcement learning incorporating rule-based rewards to\nenhance its GEC performance.\nThe contributions of this paper are as follows:\n\u2022 We leverage LLMs as reasoners for GEC, marking the\nfirst exploration of models with enhanced reasoning ca-\npabilities in this context.\n\u2022 We apply reinforcement learning to GEC by designing\na rule-based reward function specifically designed for\nGrammatical Error Correction.\n\u2022 We develop a Chinese GEC model using this methodol-\nogy, which surpasses existing baselines on the FCGEC\ndataset, delivering more accurate and interpretable cor-\nrections. Additionally, we have made the code and train\ndataset generated by DeepSeek R1 publicly available.\nRelated Work\nTraditional GEC Methods\nTraditional\nGEC\nmethods\ncan\nbe\ndivided\ninto\ntwo\ncategories: Sequence-to-Edit(Seq2Edit) and Sequence-to-\nSequence (Seq2Seq).\nSeq2Seq\nEarly work primarily focuses on sequence-to-\nsequence models (Junczys-Dowmunt et al. 2018), which\ntreats GEC as a translation task, translating erroneous sen-\ntences into corrected ones. Enhancements such as data syn-\nthesis and advanced reranking strategies have further im-\nproved these models (Stahlberg and Kumar 2021; Lichtarge,\nAlberti, and Kumar 2020) More advanced Seq2Seq ap-\nproaches use Transformer-based models. Transformer-based\nmodels have played a crucial role in recent develop-\nments, leveraging architectures like BERT, BART and T5\n(Tarnavskyi, Chernodub, and Omelianchuk 2022; Lewis\net al. 2019; Raffel et al. 2019), which excel at handling\nlong dependencies. These models have been fine-tuned\non GEC-specific datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results.\nPre-training strategies and large-scale unsupervised data\nhave been instrumental in this improvement (Grundkiewicz,\nJunczys-Dowmunt, and Heafield 2019).\nSeq2Edit\nThe Seq2Edit approach frames GEC as a se-\nquence labeling task by predicting the appropriate edit op-\neration for each token. Models like GECToR (Omelianchuk\net al. 2020), have since gained prominence, introducing an\nefficient token-level correction process that tags errors in-\nstead of rewriting entire sentences. This model reduces in-\nference time while maintaining high accuracy, particularly\nin low-resource settings (Stahlberg and Kumar 2020).\nLLMs for GEC\nLLMs such as GPT-3 and GPT-4 have been employed for\nGEC (Fang et al. 2023), although they face challenges re-\nlated to over-correction. Recent studies indicate that these\nmodels perform well when guided with in-context examples\n(Tang, Qu, and Wu 2024). Tang, Qu, and Wu (2024) uses\nsyntactic information to select in-context examples.\nIn another line, some research have explored other roles\nof LLMs in the GEC task, such as generating explanations\nfor corrections, data augmentation(Li et al. 2024; Song et al.\n2024; Wang et al. 2024b) and assessing the quality of gram-\nmatical edits(Xie et al. 2025a).\nLLM Reasoning with Post-training.\nPrevious work has primarily relied on supervised fine-tuning\nwith carefully curated datasets to enhance LLM perfor-\nmance in complex tasks like reasoning or tool use (Schick\net al. 2023; Qin et al. 2024; Gou et al. 2024). Recently,\nreinforcement learning has gained traction as a more scal-\nable and generalizable training paradigm. The development\nof RL methods for LLMs has evolved from reinforce-\nment learning from human feedback (RLHF) (Kaufmann\net al. 2023) and proximal policy optimization (PPO) (Schul-\nman et al. 2017) to more advanced techniques such as di-\nrect preference optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al. 2023),\nSimPO (Meng, Xia, and Chen 2024), and group relative pol-\nicy optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al. 2024).\n\nAmong these, GRPO (Shao et al. 2024) is specifically\ndesigned for LLMs, replacing the traditional critic with a\ngroup-based evaluation strategy. It has shown strong per-\nformance in enhancing reasoning abilities across a range\nof tasks, including mathematical problem solving (Shao\net al. 2024; Xie et al. 2025b), search engine interaction (Jin\net al. 2025; Song et al. 2025), and code generation (Li,\nZou, and Liu 2025). A pivotal application of this algo-\nrithm was demonstrated by the open-source community with\nDeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al. 2025), which showed that large-\nscale pure RL guided only by simple rule-based rewards\n(i.e., formatting rules and final answer correctness) can mo-\ntivate LLMs to develop self-emergent reasoning processes.\nThis \u201dR1-Zero\u201d paradigm has been successfully replicated\nand extended to other domains, including logic games (Xie\net al. 2025b) and vision reasoning (Huang et al. 2025). The\nflexibility of GRPO\u2019s reward function has also been lever-\naged for diverse objectives, such as assigning weights to sub-\ntasks (Yu et al. 2024) or constraining tool use frequency (Li,\nZou, and Liu 2025).\nIn this work, we build upon the established success of the\nGRPO algorithm and extend its application to GEC.\nSimilarities between Grammatical Error\nCorrection and Math Reasoning Tasks\nGrammatical Error Correction can be viewed as a complex\nreasoning task, sharing significant parallels with mathemati-\ncal reasoning due to its reliance on multi-level rule compre-\nhension and structured thought processes.\nFirst, both GEC and mathematical reasoning demand a\ndeep understanding of underlying rules. Just as math relies\non precise laws and logic, GEC requires applying grammat-\nical principles (e.g., subject-verb agreement, tense consis-\ntency, word usage) to identify and correct errors. This shared\nneed for rule adherence is a key similarity.\nSecond, both tasks require a structured, step-by-step rea-\nsoning process. Mathematics often involves decomposing\ncomplex problems and solving them incrementally. Simi-\nlarly, GEC involves analyzing sentences, identifying errors,\nand deducing corrections systematically, especially for mul-\ntiple errors within a sentence, much like stepwise mathemat-\nical problem-solving.\nThird, both GEC and math reasoning operate with clear\nobjectives and evaluation criteria. Math aims for accurate,\nlogically sound solutions. GEC seeks to produce grammati-\ncally correct and natural sentences, so we can compare out-\nputs with the correct sentences by means of string compari-\nson, and then give reward scores.\nTherefore, viewing GEC as a complex reasoning task clar-\nifies its underlying logic and suggests new paths for im-\nprovement. This perspective allows for adapting systematic\nproblem-solving approaches from mathematics to enhance\nthe accuracy and efficiency of GEC.\nOur Methodology\nThis section details our methodology, which trains a GEC\nmodel through a two-stage process: an initial SFT phase fol-\nlowed by a reinforcement learning RL phase. We design a\nrule-based reward function specifically for the GEC task.\nThis function integrates two key signals: a reward for ad-\nhering to the correct reasoning format and a reward for the\nfinal answer\u2019s correctness. We use this composite reward to\ntrain the model with the GRPO algorithm (Shao et al. 2024),\nwhich ensures stable and efficient RL training.\nData Generation\nDataset\n#Sents\n%Error\nUsage\nTraining Sets\nLang8\n1,220,906\n89.5\nSFT Stage I\nHSK\n156,870\n60.8\nSFT Stage I\nFCGEC\n36,341\n54.3\nSFT Stage II &\nRL Training\nValidation Set\nFCGEC-dev\n2,000\n55.1\nValidation\nTest Sets\nFCGEC-test\n3,000\n\u2013\nTesting\nNaCGEC-test\n5,869\n95.6\nTesting\nTable 2: Statistics of the used datasets. #Sentences denotes\nthe number of the sentences and % Error denotes the per-\ncentage of the erroneous sentences.\nFollowing previous work (Zhang et al. 2022), our Super-\nvised Fine-Tuning process is divided into two stages, with\nthe corresponding datasets detailed in Table 2. For SFT-stage\n1, we adopt the data preparation methodology from Zhang\net al. (2022). Specifically, all error-free samples are dis-\ncarded from the Lang8 and HSK datasets. The HSK dataset\nis then replicated five times and combined with the Lang8\ndataset, yielding a total of 1,568,885 sentence pairs. To cre-\nate the data for SFT-stage 2, we use the FCGEC training set.\nThe full procedure is detailed in Algorithm 1.\nWe leverage Qwen-32B and DeepSeek-R1 to perform in-\nference on the SFT-stage 1 and SFT-stage 2 datasets, respec-\ntively, to generate a new corpus containing detailed reason-\ning traces. Subsequently, we employ DeepSeek-V3 to per-\nform quality filtering on the data generated for SFT-stage 2.\nThe objective of this filtering is to select instances where the\nreasoning path correctly identifies whether a sentence needs\ncorrection and whether the proposed edit is accurate. The\nprompts used for generate detailed reasoning traces and the\nfiltering process are detailed in the Appendix. Instances that\nfail this initial check are then re-generated using R1 in a sec-\nond generation pass. This refined data is filtered again. After\nthis filtering and refinement process, we ultimately obtained\n27,501 high-quality, reasoning-augmented GEC training in-\nstances. Meanwhile, the original FCGEC training set is re-\ntained for the RL stage.\nRule-Based Reward\nIn RL, the reward is the main signal that drives model train-\ning. DeepSeek-R1-Zero (Guo et al. 2025) employs simple\nrule-based rewards that check whether the final answer is\ncorrect and whether the response follows a specific format.\nThis works well for tasks with fixed format correct answers\n\nAlgorithm 1: Two-Stage Data Generation and Filtering for SFT\n1: Input: DSource1, DSource2 (Source datasets for Stages 1 and 2)\n2: Input: MQwen (Qwen3-32B), MR1 (DeepSeek-R1), MV 3 (DeepSeek-V3)\n3: Output: DSF T 1, DSF T 2 (High-quality datasets for SFT Stages 1 and 2)\n4:\n\u25b7\u2014 Stage 1: Initial Data Generation \u2014\n5: DSF T 1 \u2190\u2205\n6: for each sentence s in DSource1 do\n7:\nsreasoning \u2190MQwen(s)\n8:\nAdd (s, sreasoning) to DSF T 1\n9: end for\n10:\n\u25b7\u2014 Stage 2: Iterative Generation and Filtering \u2014\n11: DSF T 2 \u2190\u2205\n12: for each sentence s in DSource2 do\n13:\nsreasoning1 \u2190MR1(s)\n\u25b7First generation pass\n14:\nif MV 3 accepts sreasoning1 then\n15:\nAdd (s, sreasoning1) to DSF T 2\n16:\nelse\n17:\nsreasoning2 \u2190MR1(s)\n\u25b7Second generation pass for failed instances\n18:\nif MV 3 accepts sreasoning2 then\n19:\nAdd (s, sreasoning2) to DSF T 2\n20:\nend if\n21:\nend if\n22: end for\n23: return DSF T 1, DSF T 2\nsuch as math or coding. For GEC, we can also use such a\nsimple method for rewards. Since there might be multiple\nways to correct a grammatical error, we can grant the full\nreward for the entire answer as long as one of the valid cor-\nrections is met.\nWe use a structured prompt template similar to that in\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero in Fig2. We use the same <think> tag\nformat as Qwen3 for data generation, so our prompt do not\nneed to specify this formatting requirement. The English\ntranslation of this prompt can be found in the Appendix.\nOur comprehensive reward function, Rtotal, is designed to\noptimize model outputs for both structural integrity and se-\nmantic accuracy. It is a sum of two components: a Rule Re-\nward (Rrule) and a Correctness Reward (Rc).\nRule Reward (Rrule)\nRrule combines rewards for cor-\nrect usage of predefined structural tags: open tag So\n(<answer>), close tag Sc (</answer>) with a penalty\nfor excess content length (Lsuffix) appearing after a specific\ndelimiter Sd(</answer>).\nRrule(T) = + 0.125 \u00b7 I(count(So, T) = 1)\n+ 0.125 \u00b7 I(count(Sc, T) = 1)\n\u22120.001 \u00b7 I(count(Sc, T) = 1) \u00b7 Lsuffix(T, Sd)\n(1)\nHere, I(\u00b7) is the indicator function signifying presence of\nthe respective tags. So, Sc, and Sd are specific predefined\nstring constants. Lsuffix(T, Sd) measures the length of con-\ntent trailing the delimiter Sd; this penalty component is ap-\nplied only if the close tag Sc is present. The coefficient for\nthe rule-based reward is set low, as the model has already\nbeen refined through a two-stage SFT process before RL\ntraining. This reward therefore serves as a minimal penalty\naimed only at preventing formatting errors or truncation\nfrom repetitive outputs.\nCorrectness Reward (Rc)\nRc quantifies the semantic ac-\ncuracy of the model\u2019s extracted answer R, evaluated against\nthe original input sentence Q and the set of ground truth an-\nswers A. The design of our correctness reward function is\nguided by the evaluation metric F0.5 score and thus places\na strong emphasis on precision. To reflect this, we signifi-\ncantly reward the model for correctly preserving an error-\nfree sentence.\nWe experimented with reward values of 4 and 6 for this\ncase, ultimately selecting 6 as it yielded a higher F0.5 score.\nTo encourage corrections of erroneous sentences, we assign\na process reward of 0.1 for instances where the model modi-\nfies an incorrect sentence, even if the modification itself is\nstill incorrect. For a correct modification of an erroneous\nsentence, the model receives a base reward of 2, totaling 2.1\nwith the process reward.\nConversely, to penalize inaction and over-correction, we\ndesigned distinct penalties: -0.05 for failing to modify an\nincorrect sentence, and a harsher -0.1 for incorrectly mod-\nifying a correct one. During our experiments, we tested a\nuniform penalty of -0.1 for both scenarios but found that\nthe differentiated penalties of -0.05 and -0.1 yielded supe-\nrior performance. Therefore, we adopted this latter configu-\n\nTemplate for CGEC Reasoning\n\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \u2019\u8bf7\u8bc6\u522b\n\u6211\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u662f\u5426\u6709\u8bed\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5982\u679c\n\u6709\u8bed\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u8bf7\u8fdb\u884c\u6539\u6b63\uff0c\u8bf7\u505a\u51fa\u6700\n\u5c11\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u3002\u4fee\u6539\u8981\u6c42\u5f88\u4e25\u683c\uff0c\u4e0d\u8981\u5c06\n\u6d41\u7545\u6027\uff0c\u793c\u8c8c\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\uff0c\u53e3\u8bed\u5316\uff0c\n\u957f\u77ed\u53e5\uff0c\u62d7\u53e3\u6027\uff0c\u98ce\u683c\u7b49\u4e0d\u5c5e\u4e8e\u8bed\u6cd5\u8303\n\u7574\uff0c\u800c\u5c5e\u4e8e\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u4fee\u6539\u3002\u5982\n\u679c\u6ca1\u6709\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u8bf7\u56de\u590d\u539f\u53e5\u3002\u8bf7\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4f60\u6240\n\u505a\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u90fd\u662f\u6709\u8bed\u6cd5\u4f9d\u636e\u7684\uff0c\u4e0d\u8981\u6da6\u8272\n\u53e5\u5b50\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u8bf7\u4f60\u6309\u7167\u5982\u4e0b\u683c\u5f0f\u56de\n\u590d\u3002\n<answer>\n\u4f60\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u539f\u53e5\n</answer>\n\u4f60\u8981\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n[sentence] \u2019\nFigure 2: Template for CGEC Reasoning\nration, which aligns with our focus on prioritizing precision.\nRc =\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n4.0,\nOriginal correct, model preserved.\n2.1,\nOriginal incorrect, model corrected.\n0.1,\nOriginal incorrect, model changed,\nstill incorrect.\n\u22120.05,\nOriginal incorrect, model unchanged.\n\u22120.1,\nOriginal correct, model changed.\n(2)\nRL Algorithm\nWe use the GRPO algorithm with Clip-Higher strat-\negy (Shao et al. 2024) to train the LLMs with our rule re-\nward.

Following the setup of Liu\net al. (2025), we use the Chinese native-speaker datasets\nFCGEC(Xu et al. 2022) (in-domain) and NaCGEC(Ma et al.\n2022) (out-of-domain), which are challenging datasets fea-\nturing errors and linguistic complexities typical of native\nspeakers. This strategic focus ensures the authentic correc-\ntion of in-distribution erroneous sentences, mitigating com-\nmon OOD problems from L2 learner texts, which exhibit\ndistinct error patterns. We focus on Chinese to avoid the\nevaluation challenges posed by English L2 benchmarks like\nBEA-19(Bryant et al. 2019) and CoNLL-14(Ng et al. 2014).\nOn these datasets, the strong tendency of LLMs to rewrite\nsentences for fluency conflicts with evaluation metrics that\npenalize unnecessary edits, often resulting in low scores.\nEvaluation Metrics. For the validation set experiments and\nfor the test set NaCGEC, we use the official evaluation tool\nChERRANT 1 to evaluate the model based on correction\nspan\u2019s P/R/F0.5. As for the test set FCGEC, we obtain the\nsame evaluation metrics by submitting the system results in\nCodaLab 2 online platform.\nBaselines We compare our approach with the following\ngroups of baselines to ensure a comprehensive evaluation.\n\u2022 Traditional GEC Baselines: We select several estab-\nlished GEC models for comparison.

Our Supervised Fine-Tuning process is\nconducted using the LlamaFactory3. We select Qwen3-8B as\nthe starting model. For training on SFT-stage 1, we configure\na batch size of 128 and employ a learning rate of 1e-5. The\nmodel is trained for 3 epochs , which takes approximately 20\nhours to complete. For training on SFT-stage 2, we configure\na batch size of 64 and employ a learning rate of 1e-5. The\nmodel is trained for 2 epochs , which take approximately 2\nhours to complete.\nOur implementation on RL is based on the verl4 frame-\nwork. We select the SFT model as starting models for train-\ning. During training, we configure a batch size of 128 and\nutilize 16 rollouts per prompt within the GRPO algorithm.\nWe employ a constant learning rate of 1e-6 and set the sam-\npling temperature to 1.0. The maximum generation length\nfor responses is capped at 2000 tokens. We set the KL\npenalty coefficient \u03b2 to 0. The PPO clipping range \u03f5low is\nset to 0.2, and \u03f5high is set to 0.28. All models are trained for\n5 epochs for about 40 hours on A100 * 8.\nInference Details. We evaluate our model under two set-\ntings. The first is a single pass using greedy decoding (t=0).\nThe second setting employs multi-sample voting, where we\ngenerate multiple candidates with a temperature of t=1 and\nselect the most frequent output as the final answer. We con-\n3https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory\n4https://github.com/volcengine/verl\nduct this voting process with 1, 4, 8, 16, and 32 samples.\nMain Results\nOur experimental results, presented in Table 3, are analyzed\nacross both in-domain and out-of-domain test sets to provide\na comprehensive evaluation of our approach.\nIn-Domain Performance (FCGEC)\nOn the in-domain FCGEC test set, our findings reveal sev-\neral key insights. First, among our self-implemented SFT\nbaselines, a clear trade-off emerges. The SFT (Direct Gen-\neration) model achieves higher precision and a better F0.5\nscore, whereas the SFT (with Reasoning) model demon-\nstrates a superior recall rate. This suggests that while direct\ngeneration is more conservative, incorporating a reasoning\nprocess encourages the model to identify a wider range of\nerrors, albeit at the cost of precision.\nThe introduction of Reinforcement Learning significantly\nenhances the model that utilizes reasoning. After RL train-\ning, the model shows marked improvements in both preci-\nsion and recall. Ultimately, our model achieves state-of-the-\nart performance, surpassing all other methods in both recall\nand the final F0.5 score. Furthermore, the effectiveness of\nthe voting mechanism is particularly pronounced for the RL-\ntrained model, yielding substantial gains across all metrics,\nwhich suggests that RL training improves the quality and di-\nversity of the model\u2019s sampling process. However, the SFT\nmodel do not show improvement after voting, and even ex-\nperienced a performance degradation.\nWhen compared with other baselines, our approach\ndemonstrates a significant advantage in recall.

Compared to both Tradi-\ntional GEC Baselines and other LLM-based Baselines,\nour final model\u2019s most notable improvement is its substantial\nincrease in recall, underscoring the critical role of reasoning\nin enhancing error detection. This underscores the critical\nrole of reasoning in enhancing error detection capabilities.\nSo, to fully unlock the potential of LLMs in GEC, it is evi-\ndent that we must continue to explore and effectively harness\ntheir powerful reasoning abilities.\nOut-of-Domain Generalization (NaCGEC)\nOn the out-of-domain NaCGEC test set, the results high-\nlight the robustness and generalization capabilities of our\nRL-based approach. The SFT (Direct Generation) model\nmaintains a reasonable level of performance, demonstrating\nacceptable generalization. However, the SFT (with Reason-\ning) model suffers a significant performance degradation, in-\ndicating that its complex reasoning process learned via SFT\nis brittle and does not transfer well to out-of-domain data.\nCrucially, after being trained with RL, the model\u2019s perfor-\nmance on the OOD dataset sees a substantial improvement.\nMoreover, the voting mechanism remains highly effective,\nfurther boosting performance. This combined performance\nlift strongly demonstrates that our RL paradigm fosters more\nrobust and generalizable reasoning. We attribute this to the\nfact that the reward signal, based on the correctness of the\nfinal answer, compels the model to learn fundamental and\ngeneralizable principles of grammatical judgment, rather\nthan superficial patterns specific to the training data distri-\nbution, thereby achieving stronger generalization.\nAnalysis\nFigure 3 depicts the training dynamics of RL process. The\nsecond and third charts show the progression of average re-\nward and average response length across rollout samples\nduring the RL process, both of which steadily increase over\ntime. The first chart presents the average entropy. Interest-\ningly, the average entropy first decreases and then increases.\nWe attribute this to the model initially focusing on preci-\nsion to reduce severe over-correction, which lowers explo-\nration. The latter increase in entropy indicates a shift to\nmore exploratory behavior that boosts recall.Figure 4 de-\npicts the correlation between evaluation scores and the num-\nber of voting iterations on FCGEC test set; precision and\nF0.5 scores consistently rose before stabilizing, whereas re-\ncall initially increased and then declined. Performance anal-\nysis suggests that the effectiveness of RL may stem from\nan enhanced quality of sampling, which allows the model to\nproduce higher-quality responses over multiple generations.\nConclusion\nIn this work, we have successfully demonstrated the effi-\ncacy of applying RL with rule-based rewards to the GEC\ntask. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the\nin-domain FCGEC dataset, and maintains competitive per-\nformance in recall and F0.5 score on the out-of-domain\nNaCGEC benchmark. This highlights the strong generaliza-\ntion and robustness conferred by our RL paradigm. While\nour method significantly enhances recall, we recognize the\nroom for further improvement in precision. For future work,\nwe will focus on designing a more precise reward for GEC\nbased on the minimum edit distance.\n\nReferences\nBryant, C.; Felice, M.; Andersen, \u00d8. E.; and Briscoe, T.\n2019.

However, these models often generate unnecessarily lengthy\nreasoning processes with redundant steps and circular reasoning, leading to increased computational costs,\npotential quality degradation through error propagation, and reduced interpretability [1, 2]. This poses a\nsignificant challenge for practical deployment, where different scenarios may require different levels of reasoning\ndepth and computational budget.\nRecent breakthrough systems, notably OpenAI\u2019s gpt-oss series [3], have demonstrated remarkable reasoning\ncapabilities while introducing an innovative paradigm for controlling computational effort through discrete\n1\narXiv:2508.18773v1  [cs.CL]  26 Aug 2025\n\n114] ByteDance | Seed\n\n5\n10\nThinking Token costs (k)\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\nAccuracy\nAIME 2024\n5\n10\n15\nThinking Token costs (k)\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\nAccuracy\nAIME 2025\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\nThinking Token costs (k)\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n0.98\nAccuracy\nGSM8K\n0.0\n2.5\n5.0\n7.5\nThinking Token costs (k)\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\nAccuracy\nGPQA\no3-mini\ngpt-oss-120b\nOriginal Performance Peak\nOurs\nFigure 1 Comparison of our ThinkDial and gpt-oss-style model in controllable reasoning.

Circles, squares, and triangles\nrepresent Low, Medium, and High modes, respectively.\noperational modes (e.g., \"Low\", \"Medium\", \"High\"). Unlike explicit token budget methods that require users\nto specify exact computational constraints [4], the gpt-oss paradigm provides: (1) User accessibility: users\ncan specify their preference without needing technical knowledge of token economics; (2) Dynamic allocation:\nthe system can dynamically allocate computational resources based on problem complexity rather than rigid\nconstraints; Unlike adaptive CoT approaches that are limited to binary switching between thinking and\nnon-thinking modes [5], the gpt-oss framework enables: (3) Fine-grained control: multiple efficiency priorities\n(Low, Medium, High) can be applied to the same problem based on user requirements.\nDespite the clear superiority of this mode-based paradigm, the open-source community has largely failed\nto achieve such capabilities. Existing controllable generation approaches predominantly require explicit\nspecification of token budgets [4, 6\u20138] or rely on adaptive switching between thinking and non-thinking\nmodes [5, 9, 10], both of which lack the intuitive three-mode control paradigm. This gap represents a\nsignificant limitation in democratizing advanced reasoning capabilities and has created an urgent need for\nopen-recipe solutions that can match the sophistication of proprietary systems.\nIn this paper, we introduce ThinkDial, the first open-recipe end-to-end framework to successfully implement\ngpt-oss-style controllable reasoning through discrete operational modes. As shown in Figure 1, our system\nenables seamless switching between three distinct reasoning regimes: High mode (full reasoning capability),\nMedium mode (50% token reduction with <10% performance degradation), and Low mode (75% token\nreduction with <15% performance degradation).\nThe technical foundation of our approach rests on an end-to-end training paradigm that integrates budget-mode\ncontrol throughout the entire pipeline: (1) Budget-Mode Supervised Fine-tuning: Rather than retrofitting\nexisting models with RL compression techniques, we embed controllable reasoning capabilities directly into\nthe SFT learning process. The key insights are: (a) models must learn to naturally associate different\nmode specifications with appropriate reasoning patterns, and (b) we must first establish stable output\ndistributions for each mode to prevent interference between different modes during RL training. (2) Budget-\nAware Reinforcement Learning: To enable the model to seamlessly switch between three budget modes while\npreserving its performance ceiling, we employ a two-phase RL training strategy: first conducting warm-up RL\ntraining to reach optimal performance, then implementing budget-aware reward shaping with different length\nrewards for each mode, allowing the model to learn distinct reasoning capabilities with varying response\nlengths across different modes without compromising its peak reasoning ability. Additionally, we discover that\nmodels increasingly exhibit reasoning leakage from thinking sections to answer sections during RL training, a\nphenomenon we term \"Reasoning Length Hacking\". This behavior stems from aggressive compression in Low\nmode SFT data that caused reasoning overflow, which RL training inadvertently reinforces. To address this\nissue, we incorporate Leak Penalty in our reward shaping strategy.\nExtensive experiments across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkDial\nsuccessfully achieves the target compression-performance trade-offs with remarkable consistency. Our results\nshow clear step-wise thinking token reductions (High \u2192Medium \u2192Low) while maintaining the specified\n2\n\nperformance thresholds across diverse problem types. The framework also exhibits strong generalization\ncapabilities, maintaining controllable behavior even on out-of-distribution tasks, despite being trained primarily\non mathematical reasoning data.\nThe main contributions of this work include:\n\u2022 The first open-recipe implementation of reasoning control, moving beyond token budget specification.\n\u2022 An end-to-end training framework that integrates budget-mode control from supervised fine-tuning\nthrough reinforcement learning, featuring adaptive reward shaping.\n\u2022 Comprehensive experimental validation demonstrating robust controllable reasoning across multiple\nbenchmarks with strong out-of-distribution generalization.\n2\nRelated Work\nCoT Compression\nLarge reasoning models suffer from overthinking, where models generate excessively\nlengthy chains with redundant steps, circular reasoning, or unnecessary elaboration [1, 2], leading to increased\ncomputational costs, potential quality degradation through error propagation, reduced interpretability, and\ninefficient resource utilization. Many existing works have addressed the overthinking problem through CoT\ncompression techniques, including: (1) constructing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets by selecting short\nyet correct reasoning chains [11\u201313] and learning summary tokens for training [14], (2) reward shaping\nduring reinforcement learning that rewards short and correct answers [15\u201317], provides dense rewards for\nhigher-quality reasoning processes [18], or rewards early-exit rollouts that stop sufficiently early yet can\nbe resumed to the correct answer [19], and (3) inference-time scaling methods that explore higher-quality\nintermediate reasoning processes to achieve CoT compression [20]. However, these approaches focus solely on\nCoT compression without providing controllability\u2014the ability for users to dynamically adjust the reasoning\ndepth based on their specific needs and priorities.\nControl Reasoning Effort\nSeveral works have investigated how to enable models to achieve controllable\nprioritization between efficiency and performance. (1) Explicit Reasoning Token Budget: Some methods use\nparameters to control reasoning length by setting explicit token budgets [4, 6\u20138]. However, it is challenging\nto determine appropriate budgets for problems of varying difficulty, such as comparing GSM8K and AIME\nproblems. (2) Adaptive CoT: These approaches allow models to autonomously decide between thinking and\nnon-thinking modes based on the query [5, 9, 10]. However, they are limited in their ability to provide\nmultiple efficiency priorities for the same problem. (3) Three-Mode Systems offer a structured compromise by\nproviding discrete reasoning levels (low, medium, high) that enable users to explicitly specify their preference\nfor the efficiency-performance trade-off [3]: prioritizing speed for time-sensitive applications, emphasizing\naccuracy for critical decisions, or balancing both for general use cases. This approach provides intuitive control\nwithout requiring users to understand token budgets. However, existing three-mode implementations remain\nproprietary, with no open-recipe solutions available to the research community. Our work is the first to provide\nan open-recipe solution for three-mode system, enabling users to achieve controllable efficiency-performance\ntrade-offs without requiring token specification.\n3\nMethod\nWe propose an end-to-end training paradigm for models to learn controllable reasoning capabilities through\nthree sequential steps: (1) Budget-Mode Supervised Fine-tuning to embed mode-specific reasoning patterns\ndirectly into the model\u2019s base capabilities; (2) Stage-1 RL training to establish peak performance foundation,\nthus the following RL training will not compromise the model\u2019s peak reasoning ability; (3) Stage-2 RL training\nto implement budget-aware reward shaping that enables seamless switching between reasoning modes.\n3.1\nBudget-Mode Supervised Fine-tuning\nPrevious approaches to controllable reasoning typically focus on the RL training phases. However, we argue\nthat the SFT stage is crucial for establishing the foundation of controllable reasoning capabilities for two\n3\n\nreasons: (a) models must learn to naturally associate different mode specifications with appropriate reasoning\npatterns, and (b) we must first establish stable output distributions for each mode to prevent interference\nbetween different modes during RL training.\nWe construct specialized training data that demonstrates how the same problem can be solved with different\nlevels of reasoning depth while maintaining correctness. Starting with high-quality complete reasoning chains\nfor High mode, we systematically derive compressed variants for Medium and Low modes through targeted\ntruncation at approximately rmed and rlow of the original thinking token length. After truncation, we add\nmode-specific connective text at the end of the thinking section, right before the end-of-think token (\u27e8/think\u27e9),\nto ensure smooth transitions and logical flow. Then we regenerate the answer section for each truncated\nsample to ensure the model learns to generate correct answers even when the reasoning is truncated. Only\nsamples that maintain both logical coherence and accuracy are retained. Each reasoning mode is associated\nwith distinct system prompts that guide mode-specific behavior, establishing the semantic relationship between\nmode specifications and expected reasoning patterns. The detailed construction details, statistics, prompts,\nand corresponding examples of the SFT data can be found in Appendix A and B.\nThe SFT training objective minimizes negative log-likelihood loss across all modes:\nLSFT = \u22121\nN\nN\nX\ni=1\nTi\nX\nt=1\nlog \u03c0\u03b8(oi,t|oi,<t, mi, qi)\n(1)\nwhere N is the total number of training samples, oi,t represents the t-th token in the output sequence of the\ni-th training sample, Ti denotes the length of the output sequence for the i-th sample, oi,<t represents all\ntokens before position t in the i-th output sequence, mi \u2208{High, Medium, Low} is the mode indicator for the\ni-th sample, qi is the input query for the i-th sample, and \u03c0\u03b8 is the model\u2019s policy parameterized by \u03b8. The\ntraining data is balanced across the three modes to ensure the model learns appropriate reasoning patterns\nfor each mode while preserving its original capabilities.\n3.2\nBudget-Aware Reinforcement Learning\nOur reinforcement learning strategy follows a carefully designed two-phase approach to ensure that controllable\nreasoning capabilities are built upon a strong performance foundation rather than compromising the model\u2019s\npeak abilities.\n3.2.1\nDAPO Framework\nOur reinforcement learning approach builds upon the Decouple Clip and Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimiza-\ntion (DAPO) framework [21]. DAPO optimizes the policy by sampling a group of outputs {oi}G\ni=1 for each\ninput query q (which includes both the mode specification and the problem statement) and corresponding\nanswer a. The optimization objective is formulated as:\nJDAPO(\u03b8) =\nE(q,a)\u223cD,{oi}G\ni=1\u223c\u03c0\u03b8old(\u00b7|q)\n\"\n1\nPG\ni=1 |oi|\nG\nX\ni=1\n|oi|\nX\nt=1\nmin\n\u0010\nri,t(\u03b8) \u02c6Ai,t, clip\n\u0010\nri,t(\u03b8), 1 \u2212\u03b5low, 1 + \u03b5high\n\u0011\n\u02c6Ai,t\n\u0011#\n(2)\nwhere the importance sampling ratio is ri,t(\u03b8) =\n\u03c0\u03b8(oi,t|q,oi,<t)\n\u03c0\u03b8old(oi,t|q,oi,<t) and the advantage estimate is \u02c6Ai,t =\nRi\u2212mean({Ri}G\ni=1)\nstd({Ri}G\ni=1)\n.\n3.2.2\nPhase 1: Warm-up RL Training\nIn the first phase, we focus exclusively on maximizing model performance without any compression constraints.\nThe model is trained using standard RL objectives to reach its peak reasoning capability, establishing the\n4\n\nperformance ceiling that will serve as the reference point for subsequent compression. This warm-up phase is\ncritical because it ensures that the model starts from its optimal state before learning to compress reasoning\nchains.\n3.2.3\nPhase 2: RL with Budget-Aware Reward Shaping\nThe second phase introduces controllable reasoning through budget-aware reward shaping. We implement\ndifferent response length rewards for each mode, allowing the model to learn distinct reasoning capabilities\nwith varying response lengths across different modes. However, we discovered that models tend to exploit\ncompression objectives through \"Reasoning Length Hacking\"\u2014reducing thinking tokens within \u27e8think\u27e9tags\nwhile compensating with extended reasoning in the answer section, rather than genuinely reducing reasoning\ndepth. To address this issue, we incorporate Leak Penalty in our reward shaping strategy, effectively preventing\nreasoning spillover into answer sections.\nAdaptive Reward Shaping Strategies\nTo enable controllable reasoning, we design a composite reward\nfunction that balances task performance with response length efficiency. Our approach builds upon the length\nreward framework from Kimi k1.5 [16] and extends it with mode-specific adaptive mechanisms. The total\nreward for output oi in mode m is defined as:\nR(m)\ni\n= Rtask(oi) + \u03b1(m) \u00b7 Rlength(oi) + Rleak(oi)\n(3)\nwhere Rtask(oi) \u2208{0, 1} evaluates task correctness through exact answer matching, Rlength(oi) enforces\nresponse length constraints, Rleak(oi) \u2208{\u22120.5, +0.5} ensures proper reasoning-answer separation, and \u03b1(m) is\nthe mode-specific scaling coefficient that controls response compression intensity.\nMode-Specific Response Length Reward\nThe response length reward component implements mode-specific\ncompression that allows different reasoning capabilities with varying response lengths across different modes:\nRlength(oi) =\n(\n\u03bbi\nif Rtask(oi) = 1\nmin(0, \u03bbi)\nif Rtask(oi) = 0\nwhere \u03bbi = 0.5 \u2212len(oi) \u2212lenmin\nlenmax \u2212lenmin\n(4)\nHere, len(oi) denotes the total response length of output oi (including both thinking tokens within \u27e8think\u27e9\ntags and answer tokens after \u27e8/think\u27e9), lenmin and lenmax are the minimum and maximum response lengths\nwithin the current group, respectively. The normalized response length penalty \u03bbi ensures scale invariance\nacross different problem complexities by mapping response lengths to a standardized [\u22120.5, 0.5] range.\nLeak Penalty\nDuring RL training, we observed that models increasingly exhibit Reasoning Length Hacking\nbehavior, where reasoning content leaks from the thinking section (within \u27e8think\u27e9tags) to the answer section\n(after \u27e8/think\u27e9). This phenomenon stems from pre-existing patterns in our Budget-Mode SFT data, particularly\nin Low mode samples, where reasoning often overflows into answer sections due to aggressive compression\nduring data construction. These pre-existing leakage patterns become reinforced during RL training, as they\nprovide a path for models to maintain task correctness while achieving shorter thinking sections. However, this\nreinforcement of data artifacts defeats our compression objective, as reasoning effort is merely redistributed\nrather than genuinely reduced. To counteract this undesired pattern reinforcement, we implement:\nRleak(oi) =\n(\n+0.5\nif no transition keywords in answer section\n\u22120.5\nif transition keywords detected in answer section\n(5)\nwhere \"transition keywords\" refer to reasoning-related tokens such as \"Wait\", \"Let me think\", \"Actually\",\n\"Alternatively\", \"However\", and similar metacognitive expressions that typically indicate ongoing reasoning\n5\n\nprocesses. This binary reward mechanism penalizes the appearance of such keywords in the answer section\n(content after \u27e8/think\u27e9), discouraging models from reinforcing the leakage patterns inherited from SFT data\nand ensuring that genuine reasoning compression occurs within the thinking section rather than pattern-based\ncontent redistribution. Illustrative cases are shown in Appendix C.\n3.3\nInference Usage\nDuring inference, users control reasoning modes by using the corresponding mode-specific prompts that\nwere established during training. The model supports three operational modes: High mode for maximum\naccuracy with full reasoning capability, Medium mode for balanced performance with 50% compression,\nand Low mode for rapid responses with 75% compression. Users activate each mode by incorporating the\nrespective budget-mode prompts (detailed in Appendix A) into their system prompts, ensuring consistent\nmode activation without requiring manual parameter tuning.\n4\nExperiments\n4.1\nExperimental Setup\nDatasets and Benchmarks\nWe evaluate ThinkDial across mathematical reasoning benchmarks spanning\ndifferent difficulty levels: AIME 2025 (hard), AIME 2024 (medium), and GSM8K (easy). Additionally, we\nuse GPQA diamond for out-of-distribution evaluation to assess generalization beyond mathematical domains.\nFor evaluation reliability, we use different sampling strategies: AIME problems are evaluated 32 times each,\nGSM8K uses 500 randomly sampled problems evaluated 4 times each, and GPQA uses 198 samples evaluated\n8 times each.\nImplementation Details\nWe use Qwen-2.5-Instruct-32B [10] as our foundation model. We first perform\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) including 12K original reasoning data and 6K Budget-Mode SFT data, with\ndetails provided in the Appendix B. For RL training, both the warm-up phase and the length reward shaping\nphase utilize the same set of 20K in-house mathematical problems. We set truncation ratios rmed = 0.5 and\nrlow = 0.25 for Medium and Low mode, respectively, and of course, rhigh = 1. The mode-specific scaling\ncoefficients follow a progressive strategy: \u03b1(high) = 0.0, \u03b1(med) = 0.5, and \u03b1(low) = 1.0. Training follows our\ntwo-phase strategy: 95 steps on High mode data to establish peak performance, then 40 additional steps with\nlength rewards for controllable reasoning capabilities.\nBaselines\nWe evaluate ThinkDial against several key baselines to validate the effectiveness of our approach:\n(1) Peak-Performance Checkpoint: The capability peak checkpoint of the Qwen-2.5-Instruct-32B model after\nundergoing training with 12K original reasoning data for SFT and 20K in-house mathematical problems\nfor RL. (2) w/o Budget-Mode SFT: Our framework without specialized mode-conditioned SFT but only\noriginal reasoning data to assess controllable reasoning pretraining necessity; (3) Only Budget-Mode SFT:\nExclusive mode-specific SFT without RL optimization; (4) w/o Warm-up: Direct compression training without\nestablishing peak performance; (5) Peak Truncation: Simple truncation-based compression at performance\npeaks; (6) gpt-oss-120b and o3-mini: OpenAI\u2019s proprietary controllable reasoning models for state-of-the-art\nmode-based comparison.\nEvaluation Metrics\nTo quantify the overall effectiveness of controllable reasoning, we define a composite\nmetric Accuracy-Cost Trade-off (ACT) Score that balances accuracy retention and compression efficiency.\nFor mode m \u2208{High, Medium, Low}, we compute accuracy retention ratio Am =\nAccm\nAccbase and compression\nrate Cm = 1 \u2212\nCostm\nCostbase , where base values represent the corresponding performance of the peak-performance\ncheckpoint. The ACT score is:\n6\n\nTable 1 Overall ACT Score performance.

This visualization approach reveals whether our step-wise degradation curves\nmatch those of state-of-the-art mode-based reasoning models.\n4.2\nOverall Performance Analysis\nTable 1 presents comprehensive ACT score evaluation results across different benchmarks, validating our core\nhypothesis that models can learn efficient reasoning without sacrificing problem-solving capabilities. Notably,\nHigh mode performance matches or even exceeds the original model baseline, addressing a fundamental concern\nin compression research\u2014that controllability training might compromise peak performance. The clear step-\nwise degradation pattern (High \u2192Medium \u2192Low) demonstrates precise control over the accuracy-efficiency\ntrade-off, achieving the target compression rates while maintaining specified performance thresholds.\nBeyond raw performance metrics, our framework demonstrates intelligent adaptation to problem complexity.\nThe model naturally allocates more reasoning effort to challenging problems (AIME series) while maintaining\nefficiency on simpler tasks (GSM8K), suggesting learned rather than mechanical compression behavior. Most\nimportantly, direct performance visualizations confirm successful replication of gpt-oss-style patterns\u2014our\naccuracy-token curves closely match those of gpt-oss-120b and o3-mini, proving that sophisticated mode-\nbased control can be achieved through our approach. Finally, the framework\u2019s robustness extends beyond\nmathematical reasoning, with GPQA evaluation showing effective transfer to other domains despite training\nprimarily on mathematical data.\n4.3\nDetailed Analysis\nWe conduct systematic ablations to validate the necessity of each component in our end-to-end training\nparadigm, using direct performance visualization for comprehensive analysis.\nImpact of Budget-Mode Supervised Fine-tuning\nFigure 2 demonstrates the critical role of Budget-Mode\nSFT in preventing mode interference during RL training. Without specialized SFT, RL training with length\nrewards alone causes the three operational modes to interfere with each other, leading to performance collapse\nin High mode that falls significantly below the original performance peak.

With proper SFT initialization, the RL exploration phase\ncannot cause modes to interfere with each other. Consequently, High mode maintains performance at or\nabove the original peak level, while Medium and Low modes achieve effective compression with controlled\ndegradation. However, while Budget-Mode SFT establishes mode awareness, relying exclusively on SFT\nwithout RL optimization leads to significant accuracy degradation in High and Medium modes.\nThis finding validates our end-to-end training paradigm: Budget-Mode SFT provides the essential semantic\nfoundation, while RL optimization fine-tunes the accuracy-efficiency balance. Neither component alone can\nachieve the sophisticated controllable reasoning demonstrated by our complete framework.\nThe Importance of Two-Phase RL Training Strategy\nOur two-phase RL training strategy proves essential for\neffective controllable reasoning. Figure 3 demonstrates that without the warm-up phase (Phase 1) to first\nestablish peak performance, the model struggles to maintain quality in High and Medium modes when budget-\naware reward shaping (Phase 2) is introduced. The warm-up phase ensures that compression capabilities are\nbuilt upon a strong performance foundation rather than compromising the model\u2019s peak abilities.\nMore importantly, Figure 4 compares our approach with the Peak Truncation Method that cuts reasoning\nchains at peak performance to target token budgets, then asks the model to generate summaries and\nanswers. The visualization reveals that such mechanical truncation completely fails to achieve gpt-oss-style\ncontrollable reasoning patterns. While our learned compression maintains smooth degradation curves similar\nto proprietary systems, the Peak Truncation Method shows catastrophic performance collapse, demonstrating\nthat sophisticated training is essential for effective mode-based reasoning control.\nAddressing Reasoning Length Hacking\nFigure 5 presents token statistics comparing models with and without\nLeak Penalty, revealing the critical importance of addressing Reasoning Length Hacking. The bar chart\ndemonstrates a counterintuitive phenomenon: without Leak Penalty, although thinking tokens decrease as\nintended, answer tokens significantly increase, resulting in higher total token consumption\u2014defeating our\ncompression objectives.\n8\n\n5\n10\n15\nToken costs (k)\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\nAccuracy\nAIME 2024\n5\n10\n15\nToken costs (k)\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\nAccuracy\nAIME 2025\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\nToken costs (k)\n0.93\n0.94\n0.95\n0.96\n0.97\n0.98\nAccuracy\nGSM8K\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\nToken costs (k)\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\nAccuracy\nGPQA\no3-mini\ngpt-oss-120b\nOriginal Performance Peak\nOurs\nPeak Truncation\nFigure 4 Performance comparison between our approach and the Peak Truncation Method.\nlow\nmedium\nhigh\n0\n5000\n10000\n15000\nToken Count (k)\nAIME2024\nThinking Tokens\nTotal Tokens\nlow\nmedium\nhigh\n0\n5000\n10000\n15000\nToken Count (k)\nAIME2025\nlow\nmedium\nhigh\n0\n400\n800\n1200\nToken Count (k)\nGSM8K\nlow\nmedium\nhigh\n0\n5000\n10000\n15000\nToken Count (k)\nGPQA\nlow\nmedium\nhigh\n0\n5000\n10000\n15000\nToken Count (k)\nAIME2024\nThinking Tokens\nTotal Tokens\nlow\nmedium\nhigh\n0\n5000\n10000\n15000\nToken Count (k)\nAIME2025\nlow\nmedium\nhigh\n0\n400\n800\n1200\nToken Count (k)\nGSM8K\nlow\nmedium\nhigh\n0\n5000\n10000\n15000\nToken Count (k)\nGPQA\nw/o Leak Penalty\nw/ Leak Penalty\nFigure 5 The impact of Leak Penalty on model response length. Total Tokens include both Thinking Tokens and\nSummary Tokens.\nHowever, with Leak Penalty in place, the model not only reduces thinking tokens but also maintains concise\nanswer sections, achieving genuine overall token reduction. This analysis validates that effective controllable\nreasoning requires preventing models from circumventing compression constraints through reasoning spillover\ninto answer sections.\nAnalysis of BM SFT Data Amount\nAs shown in Figure 6, the relationship between Budget-Mode (BM) SFT data amount and model performance\nreveals a critical balance in training data composition. We compare two configurations: the balanced setup\n(6K BM SFT + 12K original reasoning data) versus the BM-heavy setup (12K BM SFT + 12K original\nreasoning data).\nFirst, adding an appropriate amount of BM data does not compromise the model\u2019s performance ceiling and\ncan even provide modest improvements. The balanced configuration maintains the model\u2019s peak reasoning\ncapabilities while establishing effective mode differentiation. Importantly, moderate BM data inclusion does\nnot suppress the model\u2019s output length in High mode, preserving its ability to generate comprehensive\nreasoning when needed.\nHowever, excessive BM SFT data creates significant performance degradation. When BM SFT data increases\nsubstantially, the model\u2019s performance ceiling drops noticeably across Medium and Hard questions. More\ncritically, this BM-heavy configuration severely suppresses reasoning length across all operational modes,\nindicating that the model becomes overly constrained in its reasoning capacity. This length suppression is\nparticularly problematic as it limits the model\u2019s ability to engage in thorough reasoning even when explicitly\n9\n\n0\n50\n100\nStep\n0.60\n0.63\n0.66\n0.69\n0.72\nPerformance\nAIME2024\n0\n50\n100\nStep\n0.48\n0.52\n0.56\n0.60\nAIME2025\n0\n50\n100\nStep\n0.930\n0.945\n0.960\n0.975\nGSM8K\n0\n50\n100\nStep\n12000\n13500\n15000\n16500\n18000\nResponse Length\nResponse Length\n+ 6K BM SFT\n+ 12K BM SFT\nOnly Original\nFigure 6 Impact of budget mode (BM) SFT data amount on warm-up phase RL training performance and response\nlength.

Our end-to-end training paradigm, combining Budget-Mode\nSupervised Fine-tuning and Budget-Aware Reinforcement Learning with reward shaping, achieves target\ncompression-performance trade-offs while preserving peak capabilities.

As shown in Table 2, these mode-specific prompts\nestablish clear semantic relationships between budget constraints and expected reasoning behaviors, guiding\nthe model to adopt appropriate reasoning strategies for each mode.\nB\nBudget-Mode Supervised Fine-tuning Data\nB.1\nData Construction\nTo construct high-quality training data for budget-mode supervised fine-tuning, we build a dataset of 6K\nbudget-mode SFT samples based on our in-house training data. The dataset maintains a balanced distribution\nacross reasoning effort levels with a ratio of high:medium:low = 1:1:1, ensuring equal representation of each\nbudget mode during training.\nFor the medium and low budget modes, we set the reasoning effort ratios rmedium and rlow to 50% and 25%,\nrespectively. Additionally, we incorporate 800 GSM8K samples with empty thinking into the low mode to\nfurther enhance the model\u2019s ability to provide concise responses under strict budget constraints. Table 3\nsummarizes the data composition and characteristics for each budget mode.\n13\n\nTo preserve the model\u2019s general problem-solving capabilities during budget-aware fine-tuning, we incorporate\n12K samples of light-R1 long chain-of-thought reasoning data from DeepSeek-R1 [23]. This auxiliary dataset\nconsists of 3K samples from stage 2 training and 9k samples randomly selected from stage 1, providing diverse\nreasoning patterns that help maintain the model\u2019s foundational reasoning abilities while adapting to budget\nconstraints.\nB.2\nTraining Data Examples\nWe present training data examples demonstrating how the same problem is solved with different levels of\nreasoning depth across the three budget modes. Starting with high-quality complete reasoning chains for High\nmode, we systematically derive compressed variants for Medium and Low modes through targeted truncation\nat approximately rmedium (50%) and rlow (25%) of the original thinking token length.\nTables 4, 5, and 6 showcase the key differences: (1) the thinking section length varies significantly across modes,\nwith High mode containing the most detailed reasoning process; (2) after truncation, we add mode-specific\nconnective text before the end-of-think marker (highlighted in brown) to ensure smooth logical transitions;\nand (3) the answer sections are regenerated for each truncated sample to maintain correctness despite the\ncompressed reasoning. Only samples that preserve both logical coherence and accuracy after this construction\nprocess are retained in the training data.\nC\nCase Study of Leak Penalty\nTo assess the effectiveness of the Leak Penalty, we present two contrasting cases. Without the penalty\n(Table 7), the model keeps the thinking section brief but moves extensive reasoning\u2014detailed calculations,\nrepeated attempts, and lengthy explanations\u2014into the answer, which is precisely the leak we aim to prevent.\nWith the penalty (Table 8), the model conducts its reasoning within the \u27e8think\u27e9tags and returns a clean,\ndirect answer; the answer section contains only the final summarized solution, achieving genuine compression\nwithout loss of quality.\nD\nTraining Details\nDuring RL training, we set the maximum prompt length to 2,048 tokens and the maximum response length\nto 32,768 tokens. DAPO training is conducted for 135 steps (95 steps High mode + 40 steps budget-aware)\nwith a batch size of 256 and a mini-batch size of 256. The actor is optimized using Adam, with learning rates\nof 1 \u00d7 10\u22126, and a linear warm-up schedule over 20 steps. Our implementation uses grouped sampling with\ngroup size G = 16. For clipping parameters, we set the clip ratio low to 0.2 and clip ratio high to 0.28.\nDuring the 95-step warmup phase of RL training, we employ Dynamic Sampling. However, in the RL with\nlength rewards phase, we disable Dynamic Sampling because even when all responses in a group are either\ncorrect or incorrect, the presence of length rewards still provides effective gradients.\nOur implementation is based on the VeRL framework. Rollouts are generated using temperature sampling\n(\u03c4 = 1.0), with enforced end-of-sequence tokens. We leverage vLLM for efficient batched decoding with 256\nrollout slots and paged attention.\n14\n\nPrompt for High Mode\n/* System Prompt */\nYou have unlimited time to think and respond to the user\u2019s question.

Using the power of a point theorem, the length of the\ntangent BC squared is equal to the product of the segments of the secant from B through A to D.\nGiven |BA| = 5 and |AD| = 4, the power of point B with respect to the second circle gives\n|BC|2 = |BA| \u00d7 |BD| = 5 \u00d7 (5 + 4) = 5 \u00d7 9 = 45.

Power of a Point: For point B on the first circle, the power with respect to the second circle is given by\nBA \u00b7 BD = 5 \u00b7 9 = 45. This power is also equal to |BO2|2 \u2212r2\n2.\n2. Common Tangent: The length of the common tangent BC can be related to the radii and the distance\nbetween centers using the Pythagorean theorem for the external tangent: BC2 = (O1O2)2 \u2212(r1 \u2212r2)2.\n3. Coordinate Geometry: Placing A at the origin, O1 at (\u2212r1, 0), and O2 at (r2, 0), we use the coordinates\nof B and C on the tangent line to relate the radii and solve for r1 and r2.\nCalculations:\n\u2022 Using the power of point B, we find r1 = 5 and solve for r2 using the length AD = 4.\n\u2022 The common tangent length BC is found using the radii and the distance between centers.\nResult: After detailed calculations, the length of CD is found to be 6 .\nTable 5 A case study of supervised fine-tuning data, presenting the prompt and corresponding response for the\nmedium mode.\n16\n\nPrompt for Low Mode\n/* System Prompt */\nYou have extremely limited time to think and respond to the users query.

Power of Point B: The power of point B with respect to the circle centered at O2 is equal to the product of\nthe lengths of the segments from B to the points of intersection with the circle. Here, |BA| = 5 and |AD| = 4, so\n|BD| = |BA| + |AD| = 9. Thus, the power of B is |BA| \u00b7 |BD| = 5 \u00b7 9 = 45.\n2. Distance from B to O2: Let r1 and r2 be the radii of the circles centered at O1 and O2, respectively. Since\nBC is a common tangent, O1B \u22a5BC and O2C \u22a5BC, so O1B \u2225O2C. The distance between O1 and O2 is\nr1 + r2.\n3. Using Coordinates and Similar Triangles: By setting up coordinates and using the fact that BA intersects\nthe second circle at D, we find that the power of B gives |BO2|2 \u2212r2\n2 = 45.\n4. Length of CD: Since CD is a tangent segment from C to D on the circle, and using the properties of the\ntangent and the circle, we find that CD can be determined by the power of point C or by recognizing similar\ntriangles.

We need to find the number of nonnegative integer triples (a, b, c) such\nthat a + b + c = 300 and the sum of all pairwise products of the form a2b, a2c, etc., equals 6,000,000. First,\nlet\u2019s denote the sum S = a + b + c = 300 and the other sum as T = a2b + a2c + b2a + b2c + c2a + c2b =\n6,000,000.\nI should balance depth of reasoning with efficiency, so now I\u2019ll stop thinking and deliver a well-\nconsidered response.\n</think>\nLet\u2019s denote S = a + b + c = 300. We can factor the given sum T = a2b + a2c + b2a + b2c + c2a + c2b =\nab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a). Since a + b = S \u2212c, b + c = S \u2212a, and c + a = S \u2212b, we can rewrite T as:\nT = ab(S \u2212c) + bc(S \u2212a) + ca(S \u2212b) = S(ab + bc + ca) \u22123abc\nGiven T = 6, 000, 000 and S = 300, we have:\n300(ab + bc + ca) \u22123abc = 6, 000, 000\n( ... solutions omitted for brevity )\nBut wait, let\u2019s check d = 0 to d = 100: that\u2019s 101 values of d. For d = 0, 1 ordered triple. For d = 1 to 99 (99\nvalues), 6 each: 99 \u00d7 6 = 594. For d = 100, 6. Total 1 + 594 + 6 = 601.\nBut earlier, when we thought only specific ratios worked, we were wrong; the algebra shows any arithmetic\nsequence centered at 100 works, which is a broader set.\n( ... solutions omitted for brevity )\nTherefore, every solution is a permutation of (100 \u2212d, 100, 100 + d) for some nonnegative integer d \u2264100.\nNow, count the ordered triples:\n- When d = 0: (100,100,100) \u21921 way.\n- When d \u22651 and d \u226499: Each triple has three distinct numbers, so 3! = 6 permutations per d. There are 99\nsuch d values (1 through 99).\n- When d = 100: The triple includes a zero: (0,100,200). This has one zero and two distinct non-zeros, so\npermutations: choose position for 0 (3 choices), then arrange 100 and 200 in the remaining two positions (2\nways): 3 \u00d7 2 = 6.\nTotal permutations: 1 + 99 \u00d7 6 + 6 = 1 + 594 + 6 = 601.\nYes, this makes sense because for any nonnegative integer d from 0 to 100, the triple (100 \u2212d, 100, 100 + d) is\nvalid, and each such triple (except all 100s) can be permuted in 6 ways if all distinct, or 6 ways if one is zero.\nThe earlier mistake was not recognizing the general arithmetic sequence form, but the algebra confirms T is\nconstant for this family, which exhausts all solutions due to the symmetric dependency on the average term\n100.\nFinal Answer 601\nTable 7 A case where the leak penalty was not applied, resulting in the think process leaking into the answer section.\n18\n\n<think>\nUm, let\u2019s try to solve this problem.

Hmm, that\u2019s a\nsymmetric equation in a, b, c. Maybe we can use some symmetry or substitution to simplify it.\nFirst, let\u2019s denote S = a + b + c = 300. The given expression is the sum of all terms like a2b, which is\nsymmetric. Let\u2019s recall that in symmetric problems, often assuming an order, like a \u2265b \u2265c, can help reduce\nthe cases we need to check, and then we can multiply by the number of permutations at the end.\nLet\u2019s assume a \u2265b \u2265c.

Prior studies have\nshown that well-written MCQs can support learner\nengagement in higher levels of cognitive reason-\ning such as application or synthesis of knowledge\n(Davis, 2009; Zaidi et al., 2018). Among the com-\nponents of MCQs, the difficulty and relevance of\ndistractors are key indicators of question quality\n(Gierl et al., 2017; Kumar et al., 2023). However,\nsystematically crafting quality assessment ques-\ntions and distractors in education is a crucial yet\ntime-consuming, expertise-driven undertaking that\ncalls for innovative solutions (Indran et al., 2024).\nWith the rapid advancement of large language\nmodels (LLMs) that demonstrate remarkable capa-\n*Corresponding author.\nContext: The following is a cell \nfrom a plant leaf, with various \norganelles, each having distinct \nstructures and performing \nspecific functions in different \nbiochemical processes.\nAnswers: chloroplast\nOptions:\nQuestion: Which organelle in \nthe plant cell is primarily \nresponsible for \nphotosynthesis? \nMPQG \n(a)          (b)          (c)           (d)\nLLM\nFigure 1: An example of the CmOS Framework, showing\nhow it generates a visual MCQ to identify the part re-\nsponsible for photosynthesis, using content that includes\nan image, an answer, and the context about plant cell.\nbilities in scientific question answering, researchers\nhave begun to explore their potential in the auto-\nmatic generation of educational questions to alle-\nviate human labor, including objective and open-\nended formats (Cao and Wang, 2021; Rodriguez-\nTorrealba et al., 2022). Prior to this study, research\non MCQs generation using LLMs primarily fo-\ncused on two areas: generating questions and tex-\ntual options based on textual input (Cao and Wang,\n2021; Le Berre et al., 2022), and incorporating mul-\ntimodal inputs to generate questions and textual op-\ntions enriched with visual information (Yeh et al.,\n2022; Wang and Baraniuk, 2023; Luo et al., 2024).\nHowever, the task of generating MCQs with visual\noptions remains largely unexplored. According to\nMayer\u2019s cognitive theory of multimedia learning\n(Mayer, 2005), visual stimuli play an indispensable\nrole in promoting learners\u2019 cognitive engagement\nby facilitating dual-channel processing, reducing\nextraneous cognitive load, and enhancing the inte-\ngration of new information with prior knowledge.\nThere are three major challenges in generating\nMCQs with visual options. Firstly, not all MCQ op-\ntions are suitable for visual representation (Butler,\n2018). For example, mathematical computation\nproblems typically rely on precise numerical or\nsymbolic expressions which is difficult to convey\nthrough static images. Secondly, MCQs with vi-\nsual option require explicit scaffolding for visual\narXiv:2508.18772v1  [cs.CV]  26 Aug 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nanalysis; otherwise, students may incur unneces-\nsary cognitive overload (Kim and Hannafin, 2011).\nLastly, current Text-to-Image (T2I) models face\nkey challenges in visual option generation: (i) The\ninherent variability in visual option generation of-\nten leads to inaccurate or unrealistic outputs. (ii)\nThe educational domain lacks specialized image\nrepositories to meet the precise visual needs of aca-\ndemic content. As shown in Figure 1, the goal of\nour work is to generate an appropriate question and\nvisual options from an input consisting of an image,\ncontext, and the answer, via processing pipeline.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a novel\nframework named Cross-modal Options Synthesis\n(CmOS), integrating Multimodal Chain-of-Thought\n(MCoT) reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Gen-\neration (RAG) to generate MCQs with visual op-\ntions. Specifically, the framework employs an Mul-\ntimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to encode\nmultimodal content and embeds it into a four-stage\nMCoT architecture that separates content discrimi-\nnation, question and reason generation, alternative\npairs screening, and visual options generation. To\nimprove the quality of visual options, we leverage\nRAG to retrieve similar images from an external\neducational image database as templates for gener-\nation, and then the MLLM and the T2I model are\nrequired to optimize based on the templates.\nThe practical and impactful contributions of this\nwork in MCQs can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We first explore how to generate high-quality\nMCQs with visual options, addressing a key\ngap in current MCQs generation research.\n\u2022 We propose a framework named CmOS, which\ngenerates questions through multiple ques-\ntions screening, and produces plausible visual\noptions by providing templates and tuning.\n\u2022 Experimental results on three tasks indicate\nthat CmOS achieves superior performance over\nexisting methods, effectively harnessing the\ncapabilities of both MLLMs and T2I models.\n2\nRelated Works\n2.1\nAutomatic Question Generation\nAutomatic Question Generation (AQG) is a tech-\nnology that addresses the high costs and inefficien-\ncies of manually creating educational questions\n(Brown et al., 2005). Early studies in AQG pri-\nmarily focus on textual question generation, com-\nprising two categories of generation methods. The\nfirst is the Level of Understanding approach, en-\ncompassing syntax-based (Afzal et al., 2011; Afzal\nand Mitkov, 2014) and semantic-based methods\n(Ai et al., 2015; Afzal and Mitkov, 2014). The sec-\nond is the Procedure of Transformation approach,\nincluding template-based (Kusuma et al., 2018,\n2022), rule-based (Singhal and Henz, 2014; Sing-\nhal et al., 2015), and statistical methods (Kumar\net al., 2015; Uto et al., 2023). However, these meth-\nods rely heavily on text as both input and output,\nexhibiting limited capability in processing multi-\nmodal information. In terms of question types,\nprior research has mainly addressed open-ended\nand MCQs (Kurdi et al., 2020; Mulla and Gharpure,\n2023), with the latter receiving increasing attention\ndue to their standardized format and ease of au-\ntomated assessment (Touissi et al., 2022; Al Shu-\nraiqi et al., 2024; Newton and Xiromeriti, 2024).\nWith the swift progress of LLMs and MLLMs, re-\nsearchers have begun to explore their application\nin generating high-quality educational questions\n(Mulla and Gharpure, 2023; Yadav et al., 2023;\nNewton and Xiromeriti, 2024; Al Shuraiqi et al.,\n2024). Prompt engineering and fine-tuning have\nbeen employed to enhance the effectiveness of\nthese models in question generation, with grow-\ning interest in their potential for multimodal MCQs\ngeneration (Zhao et al., 2022; Wang and Baraniuk,\n2023; Luo et al., 2024). However, current studies\non multimodal MCQs generation predominantly\nfocus on aligning images with question context,\nwhile significantly overlooking the integration of\nvisual information into option generation progress.\n2.2\nChain-of-Thought Prompt\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt is an important\ntechnique aimed at enhancing the multi-step reason-\ning capabilities of LLMs. Initial work by Wei et al.\n(2022) showed that few-shot CoT could signifi-\ncantly improve performance on arithmetic and com-\nmonsense tasks. Later, researchers introduced zero-\nshot variants, such as appending simple phrases\nlike \u201cLet\u2019s think step by step\u201d. This approach ac-\ntivated reasoning in LLMs without requiring ad-\nditional examples (Kojima et al., 2022). To mini-\nmize the need for manually crafted demonstrations,\nmethods like Auto-CoT were developed (Zhang\net al., 2022). These ways leverage LLMs to gen-\nerate reasoning examples with minimal supervi-\nsion. Further reliability improvements came from\nself-consistency decoding, which samples multi-\nple reasoning paths and selects the most frequent\n\nanswer (Wang et al., 2022). Beyond text-based\ntasks, researchers have extended CoT to multi-\nmodal content and proposed a method named Mul-\ntimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) (Zhang et al.,\n2023). MCoT integrates textual and visual rea-\nsoning through several implementation strategies.\nThese include two-stage pipelines that separate ra-\ntionale generation from answer prediction (Zhang\net al., 2023), dual-guidance approaches that dis-\nentangle visual and textual reasoning (Jia et al.,\n2024), and methods that interleave image regions\nwith textual steps (Mitra et al., 2024; Hu et al.,\n2024). These designs enable MLLMs to perform\nwell across various multimodal benchmarks. More\nrelated work is discussed in Appendix A.\n3\nMethod\nProblem Definition Given an input consisting of\nC = (T, I, A), where T represents the text and I\nrepresents the image, and A denotes the answer, the\ntask is to generate an output that includes a high-\nquality question Q, a visual option A\u2032 correspond-\ning to the answer, and multiple visual distractors\nDs, each associated with a textual distractor.\n3.1\nModel Architecture\nAs illustrated in Figure 2, our CmOS consists of\nfour distinct stages: (i) evaluating content convert-\nibility, (ii) generating alternative questions and\nreasons, (iii) selecting the optimal pair, and (iv)\ngenerating option descriptions and visual options.\nTo address the complexity of content discrimina-\ntion, question and reason generation, and visual\noption generation, we introduce the MCoT prompt.\nThis method enables MLLMs to identify suitable\ncontent for conversion, generate questions and rea-\nsons towards the answer, and guide the genera-\ntion of visual options, based on dynamically exem-\nplars. Specifically, in stage (a), we retrieve relevant\nmultimodal exemplars from an external repository,\nwhich includes the original content (text and image)\nalong with convertibility judgments and reasons.\nThey are used to construct dynamic MCoT prompts,\nenhancing the model\u2019s accuracy in content discrim-\nination. In stage (b), we provide three reference\nprocesses for each question-reason pair, directing\nthe MLLM to emulate the exemplar reasons. In\nstage (c), the Optimal Question-Reason Match-\ning (OQRM) module selects the optimal question-\nreason pair based on internal and external consis-\ntency. In stage (d), the option generator produces\ntextual options and their corresponding visual de-\nscriptions. Based on these descriptions, relevant\nimages are dynamically retrieved from an external\nimage database, serving as reference templates for\ngenerating visual options. Iterative evaluation and\ntuning using a Text-to-Image (T2I) model further\nimprove the quality of the visual options.\n3.2\nExemplars Construction and Retrieval\nWe construct exemplars using Qwen2.5-VL-72B\n(Bai et al., 2023), a MLLM with strong visual un-\nderstanding and instruction-following capabilities.\nThe exemplars include two parts: (i) the original\nMCQ\u2019s context, image, and answer; and (ii) the\njudgment and reason about its convertibility. We ex-\ntract 482 questions from the ScienceQA test dataset\nas the foundation for exemplars construction.\nAfter constructing the exemplars dataset DE, we\nintroduce an exemplar retrieval mechanism to as-\nsist the discriminator in accurately and efficiently\ndetermining the convertibility of the given con-\ntent. Specifically, we adopt the latest FARE en-\ncoder (Schlarmann et al., 2024), which enhances\nrobustness over CLIP. The FARE consists of a\nvisual encoder \u03d5 : I \u2192RD and a text encoder\n\u03c8 : T \u2192RD. For a given instance S to be con-\nverted, we separately encode its corresponding con-\ntext t, answer a, and image i as Vt, Va, and Vi. Let\nI = {1, 2, . . . , N} be the index set of exemplars.\nDenote the encoded vectors of the j-th exemplar\u2019s\ntext, answer, and image as Vj\nt , Vj\na, and Vj\ni , respec-\ntively. We compute cross-modality similarities:\nSimj\nm =\nVj\nm \u00b7 Vm\n\u2225Vj\nm\u22252 \u2225Vm\u22252\n,\nm \u2208{t, a, i}.\n(1)\nSelect the exemplar by the maximum similarity:\nj\u22c6= arg max\nj\u2208I\nmax\n\u0000Simj\nt, Simj\na, Simj\ni\n\u0001\n.\n(2)\nThe exemplar with index j\u22c6is concatenated with\ninstance S before being fed into the discriminator.\n3.3\nOptimal Question-Reason Match\nAfter being processed by the question generator\nand reason generator with MCoT, several question-\nreason pairs are produced. To determine which pair\nis most suitable for generating multiple visual op-\ntions, we introduce the Optimal Question-Reason\nMatch module (OQRM), which can calculates a\nTotal Match Score (TMS) for each question-reason\npair to effectively identify the optimal candidate.\n\nQuestion Generator\nReason Generator\nContext:\nAnswer: chloroplasts\nDifferent parts in \nplant cells play key \nroles in the process \nof photosynthesis.\nQuestion1: Which organelle \nin the plant cell image is \nprimarily responsible for \nphotosynthesis?\nReason1: \nStep 1: Photosynthesis is the \nprocess \u2026\u2026 which absorbs \nlight energy.\nStep 2: In plant cells \u2026\u2026 that \nperform photosynthesis.\nStep 3: Based on the labeled \ndiagram\u2026\u2026 is the chloroplast.\nDiscriminator\nQuestion2: Identify the \norganelle responsible for \nconverting sunlight into \nenergy in the plant cell image.\nReason2\uff1a\u2026\u2026\nReason2\uff1a\u2026\u2026\nQuestion3\nQuestion1\nQuestion2\nOQRM\nReason1\nQuestion1\nOption Generator\nAnswer:\nChloroplasts\nDescription\uff1a\ncolor,shape, style\nDistractor:\n(1)Mitochondria \nDescription ...\n(2)Ribosomes\nDescription ...\n(3)Golgi apparatus\nDescription ...\nRetrieve templates \nand Tuning\nChloroplasts\nMitochondria \nD1&I1 \nD2&I2\n\u2026\u2026\nContext:\nDifferent structures in plant \ncells play key roles in the \nprocess of photosynthesis.\nImage\nQuestion: Which organelle in the plant cell \nimage is primarily responsible for \nphotosynthesis?\n\uff081\uff09          \uff082\uff09       \uff083\uff09         (4)\nImage Database\nQuestion3: Where in the \nplant cell image does \nphotosynthesis mainly occur?\nExemplar \nRetrieval\nexemplar1\nexemplar2\nexemplar3\nExemplar \nDatabase\nContext\nImage\n(a) Evaluate content convertibility\n(b) Generate alternative questions and reasons\n(c) Screen optimal pair\nImage\nWhich organelle \nin the plant cell \nimage is \nprimarily \nresponsible for \nphotosynthesis?\n(d) Generate option descriptions and visual options\nMultiple-choice question with visual options\nRound\u22643\nFigure 2: Overview of multimodal educational questions and visual options generation: (a) Evaluate content\nconvertibility: we concatenate the best retrieved exemplar with the instances for content discrimination; (b) Generate\nalternative questions and reasons: we use prompts to require MLLM to generate diverse questions and reasons; (c)\nScreen optimal pair: we select the optimal question-reason pair based on internal and external consistency; and (d)\nGenerate option descriptions and visual options: we generate visual options using templates and tuning methods.\nThe visual encoder \u03d5 encodes the image i from\nthe instance S to obtain a high-dimensional vector\nrepresentation Vi. The text encoder \u03c8 processes\nthree textual components: the newly generated\nquestion q, the reason r, and the phrase \"a photo\nof A\" p, yielding vectors Vq, Vr, and Vp, respec-\ntively. The TMS for the k-th (k \u22081, 2, . . . , m)\nquestion-reason pair (qk, rk) is calculated as the\nweighted sum of two similarity scores: internal\nconsistency Cintk and external consistency Cextk.\nCintk measures the coherence of the question-\nreason pair within its embedding space RD, iden-\ntifying the pair closest to the center (CQ, CR) to\nensure coherence. Cextk evaluates the similarity\nbetween the pair and the original content. This\napproach aligns with the self-consistency method\nproposed by (Wang et al., 2022), which selects the\nmost consistent reason path to mitigate hallucina-\ntions and avoid generating irrelevant distractors.\nCintk =\nVqk \u00b7 CQ\n\u2225Vqk\u22252\u2225CQ\u22252\n+\nVrk \u00b7 CR\n\u2225Vrk\u22252\u2225CR\u22252\n(3)\nwhere CQ= 1\nm\nPm\nk=1 Vqk, CR= 1\nm\nPm\nk=1 Vrk.\nCextk =\nVi \u00b7 Vrk\n\u2225Vi\u22252\u2225Vrk\u22252\n+\nVqk \u00b7 Vp\n\u2225Vqk\u22252\u2225Vp\u22252\n(4)\nFinally, considering the hyperparameter \u03b1 to op-\ntimally balance Cintk and Cextk, we select the\nquestion-reason pair (q\u2217, r\u2217) with the highest TMS:\n(q\u2217, r\u2217) = arg max\n(qk,rk)\nX\n(\u03b1Cintk + Cextk)\n(5)\n3.4\nVisual Options Generation\nWe require the Option Generator to produce t op-\ntions and their visual descriptive information (in-\ncluding a correct option and t\u22121 distractor options)\nbased on the optimal question-reason pair. Based\non the RAG, we propose an adaptive method to\ngenerate visual options. This method integrates\nthe excellent text-image alignment ability of the\nMLLM G with the generation and enhancement\ncapabilities of the Text-to-Image (T2I) model P.\nWe construct an image database D by collect-\ning images ij from the ScienceQA and generating\ncorresponding captions cj (j = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , s) us-\ning MLLM. Given an option description di (i =\n1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , t), we compute the total similarity be-\ntween di and each image-caption pair as following:\nSimij = \u03b2\n\u03d5(ij) \u00b7 \u03c8(di)\n\u2225\u03d5(ij)\u22252\u2225\u03c8(di)\u22252\n|\n{z\n}\nimage-description\n+\n\u03c8(cj) \u00b7 \u03c8(di)\n\u2225\u03c8(cj)\u22252\u2225\u03c8(di)\u22252\n|\n{z\n}\ncaption-description\n(6)\nFor each option description di, we retrieve the\n\nee,\n\n\u00a2,\n\u201cay\n\n\u201cuy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage ij from D with the highest Simtotal\nij\nas tem-\nplate. Using description di and templateij, the\nimage generator P produces a visual image, which\nis then evaluated by G to obtain a similarity score\nSimk. If Simk meets or exceeds the threshold\n\u03c3 = 0.8, the image is accepted. Otherwise, G pro-\nvides suggestions S to P for iterative tuning of the\ngenerated image up to three rounds.\n4\nExperiment\n4.1\nExperimental Setups\nDataset\nTo evaluate our framework\u2019s perfor-\nmance in content discrimination, question and vi-\nsual option generation, we constructed our test\ndatasets based on the ScienceQA benchmark test\nset DO(Lu et al., 2022). Each record in DO con-\ntains the context, question, options, answer, grade,\nsubject, and so on. We randomly sampled 482\ninstances from DO and added \u201cconvertible\u201d and\n\u201creason\u201d to form the exemplar set DE. In this paper,\nconvertible denotes whether the original content\ncontains core entities or concepts that can be clearly\nvisualized and transformed into image-option ques-\ntions while maintaining or enhancing cognitive de-\nmand. The remaining data comprised DC, input to\nthe content discrimination module. Each record in\nDC includes the context, image, and answer. From\nDC, 812 (40%) convertible instances were selected\nas DQ for downstream tasks. Three human annota-\ntors evaluated the convertibility of DC, and 51.6%\nof the instances were labeled \u201cTRUE\" in the con-\nvertible column. They also created new questions\nfor DQ. A summary of the four datasets can be\nfound in Appendix B and Figure 8.\nMetrics\nWe adopt automatic and human evalua-\ntion to assess the performance of CmOS. Specifically,\ndifferent tasks are evaluated using tailored metrics.\nFor content discrimination, we use Accuracy to\nmeasure the its ability to identify convertible con-\ntent. For question generation, we utilize BLEU-4\n(Papineni et al., 2002) and ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004)\nfor question generation, both of which have been\nwidely used in AQG works. For visual option, we\nadopt the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) (Sara\net al., 2019) and the CLIP-T (Li et al., 2024) as\nevaluation metrics. SSIM evaluates the perceptual\nquality of visual options by jointly modeling lumi-\nnance, contrast, and structural consistency. CLIP-T\nquantifies the semantic alignment between gener-\nated visual option and the corresponding descrip-\ntion. Given the limitations of automatic evaluation\nin capturing human perception, we further incor-\nporate human evaluation. The specific criteria are\npresented in the human evaluation section.\nBaselines\nFor content discrimination and ques-\ntion generation, we compare our CmOS with state-\nof-the-art (SOTA) methods, including VL-T5 (Yeh\net al., 2022), MultiQG-Ti (Wang and Baraniuk,\n2023), Multimodal-CoT (Zhang et al., 2023),\nChain-of-Exemplar (Luo et al., 2024) (All these\nbaselines, as well as our CmOS, adopt QWEN2.5-\nVL-7B-INSTRUCT (Bai et al., 2023) as the back-\nbone), and CHATGPT under both zero-shot and\nin-context learning settings (with up to three ex-\nemplars in prompts). For visual option generation,\ndue to the limited prior work on educational dis-\ntractor visuals, we evaluate off-the-shelf model\nAPIs (FLUX-SCHNELL, DALLE-3, STABLE\nDIFFUSION-XL, WANX2.1-PLUS) using identical\noption descriptions. Our method adopts QWEN2.1-\nTURBO as the backbone. Baselines and other ex-\nperimental details are provided in Appendix C.\n4.2\nEvaluation on Content Discrimination\nFirst, we evaluate the discrimination accuracy of\nCmOS and baselines in determining content convert-\nibility. As shown in Figure 3, CmOS, which retrieves\nsimilar exemplars from a small pool, significantly\nimproves the accuracy and achieves an average of\n88.2%, outperforming all baselines. Notably, al-\nthough CHATGPT shows lower accuracy in the\nzero-shot, few-shot prompt significantly enhances\nits score. Particularly, its average accuracy under\nthe 3 shot becomes comparable to CoE.\nIn terms of subject domains, all baseline mod-\nels exhibit the lowest discrimination accuracy on\nquestions from the Natural Sciences (NAT), while\nachieving the highest accuracy on those from the\nLanguage Sciences (LAN). Furthermore, ques-\ntions accompanied by images (IMG) tend to yield\nlower discrimination accuracy compared to text-\nonly questions (TXT), indicating potential chal-\nlenges in multimodal reason. In addition, questions\ndesigned for students in higher grades are generally\nmore difficult to discriminate accurately than those\nintended for lower grades, suggesting increased\ncomplexity in advanced educational content.\n4.3\nEvaluation on Question Generation\nAutomatic Evaluation\nTable 1 presents the per-\nformance of CmOS with \u03b1 = 0.6, compared to\nSOTA models in terms of BLEU-4 and ROUGE-L.\n\n20\n40\n60\n80\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n20\n40\n60\n80\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n20\n40\n60\n80\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n20\n40\n60\n80\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n20\n40\n60\n80\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n20\n40\n60\n80\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n20\n40\n60\n80\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n20\n40\n60\n80\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nAccuracy(%)\nAccuracy(%)\nAccuracy(%)\nAccuracy(%)\nAccuracy(%)\nAccuracy(%)\nAccuracy(%)\nAccuracy(%)\n0 shot\n1shot\n3 shot\nVL-T5\nMultiQG-TI\nMultimal-CoT\nCoE\nCmOS(Ours)\nw/o Exemplar\nNAT\nSOC\nLAN\nTXT\nIMG\nG1-6\nG7-12\nAVG\nFigure 3: Automatic evaluation results of content discrimination. In terms of accuracy, regardless of subject,\nmodality, or grade, our framework outperforms all baselines, with an average accuracy of 88.2.\nThe results show that CmOS significantly outper-\nforms all baselines on both metrics, regardless of\nsubject area, modality, or grade level. Among them,\nMultiQG-TI and Multimodal-CoT, which leverage\nMLLMs fine-tuned with CoT prompting, slightly\noutperform VL-T5, a pretrained language model\nenhanced with visual understanding. Compared to\nMultiQG-TI and Multimodal-CoT, CoE achieves\nbetter performance by integrating exemplar-based\nCoT reasoning. The table also reports CHATGPT\u2019s\nperformance under zero-shot and few-shot. Al-\nthough CHATGPT benefits from more in-context\nexamples, it remains substantially behind our CmOS\non the multimodal question generation.\nFurthermore, across the three subjects, all base-\nlines consistently achieve the highest performance\nin Social Science (SOC) and the lowest in Lan-\nguage Science (LAN). These baselines also exhibit\nimproved performance on image-paired questions\n(IMG) compared to text-only ones (TXT). In con-\ntrast, CmOS demonstrates stable performance across\ndifferent subjects and grade levels, highlighting\nthe general ability of the framework in educational\ncontent. However, BLEU-4 and ROUGE-L primar-\nily measure surface-level lexical overlap between\ngenerated and reference questions, failing to cap-\nture semantic relevance. To address this limitation,\nwe incorporate the METEOR metric (Banerjee and\nLavie, 2005), which accounts for semantic match-\ning, and also report the results in Appendix D.\nHuman Evaluation\nIn addition to automatic\nevaluation, we conduct human evaluation to further\nassess the quality of generated questions. We ran-\ndomly sample 50 questions from different methods\nand recruit three annotators to rate each question\non a 1-5 scale across four criteria: (1) Fluency\n(Song and Zhao, 2016), assessing the naturalness\nand readability of the question; (2) Grammatical-\nity (Heilman, 2011), measuring syntactic correct-\nness; (3) Complexity (Rodriguez-Torrealba et al.,\n2022), evaluating the cognitive or linguistic chal-\nlenge posed by the question; and (4) Relevance\n(Chughtai et al., 2022), measuring how well the\nquestion matches the background content. Detailed\nguidelines are provided in Appendix H.\nAs shown in Table 2, although the ground-truth\nquestions achieve the highest scores across all met-\nrics, CmOS outperforms all baselines and obtains\nthe closest performance to the ground-truth, with\nan average score of 4.58. These results demon-\nstrate that our framework can generate high-quality\neducational questions that are fluent, correct, en-\ngaging, and relevant to the content. Moreover, both\nMultimodal-CoT and CoE significantly outperform\nVL-T5, highlighting the effectiveness of MCoT rea-\nsoning.

Benefiting from\nstrong semantic understanding and stylistic gener-\nalization, WANX2.1-PLUS slightly outperforms the\nother three baselines in most categories. In contrast,\nno substantial differences are observed among the\nremaining baselines. The hyperparameter analysis\nresults for \u03b1 and \u03b2 are provided in Appendix E.\nTo further evaluate performance across disci-\nplines, we analyze the results for three academic\nsubjects. Remarkably, CmOS achieves the best per-\nformance in the social sciences (SOC), but per-\nforms worst in language sciences (LAN), mirroring\nthe trends observed in question generation perfor-\nmance. Moreover, for image-equipped (IMG) ques-\ntions, CmOS obtains the highest scores in both SSIM\nand CLIP-T, while for text-only (TXT) questions,\nits performance degrades significantly on both met-\nrics. The findings demonstrate that visual input\nenhances the semantic fidelity and contextual plau-\nsibility of generated descriptions. Additionally,\nthe consistently strong performance of our CmOS\nframework across subjects and grade levels further\ndemonstrates its robust generalization ability.\nHuman Evaluation\nSimilarly, we invited three\nqualified annotators to subjectively evaluate the vi-\nsual options generated by different methods. Using\na 5-point Likert scale, they rated each visual option\nacross three important dimensions: (1) Plausibil-\nity (Luo et al., 2024), assessing coherence with\nthe background content and question context; (2)\nDistractibility (Gierl et al., 2017), measuring the\ncognitive burden posed by distractor visual options;\nand (3) Engagement (Gierl et al., 2017), reflect-\ning how much the visual options attract learners\u2019\nattention. Guidelines are detailed in Appendix H.\nTable 4 presents a summary of the human evalu-\nation results. Generally, CmOS surpasses other T2I\nmodels in terms of plausibility and distractibility.\nThis indicates that the visual options it generates\nare more semantically consistent and possess a\nhigher level of misleadingness, sufficient to test\nhuman judgment. However, even though image\ntemplates and tuning was carried out to enhance\nengagement, the improvement is relatively limited.\nCmOS performs slightly worse than DALLE-3 but\nmarginally better than STABLEDIFFUSION-XL. It\nis worth noting that the average scores across all\nmethods are relatively low. Specifically, CmOS only\nachieves a score of 3.55 out of 5. This situation\nhighlights that creating visual content with peda-\ngogical effectiveness still poses a large challenge.\n4.5\nAblation Study\nWe perform ablation studies to investigate the ef-\nfects of the proposed approaches in terms of similar\nexemplar retrieval, optimal question-reason match,\ntemplate and tuning, as presented in Figure 3, Table\n1 and Table 3. There are several notable findings.\nFinding1: Figure 3 illustrates that removing the\nretrieval of similar exemplars forces the model to\nrely solely on abstract judgment criteria when as-\nsessing whether input content can be converted into\nvisual-option questions. This change causes accu-\nracy to drop by 19.5%, suggesting that concrete\nreason exemplars contribute more effectively to\n\nMethod\nSubject\nModality\nGrade\nAVG\nSSIM\u2191/ CLIP-T\u2191\nNAT\nSOC\nLAN\nTXT\nIMG\nG1-6\nG7-12\nFlux.schnell\n39.0/28.9\n41.5/29.1\n29.7/29.4\n37.6/29.4\n42.2/28.2\n39.2/29.2\n38.8/28.5\n39.1/29.0\nDALLE-3\n40.2/30.1\n43.8/29.3\n30.6/29.0\n38.4/30.2\n43.1/29.0\n42.4/29.9\n39.5/29.3\n40.2/29.7\nStableDiffusion-XL\n40.6/27.3\n43.9/28.5\n31.4/27.4\n39.4/28.4\n43.5/27.1\n41.2/28.1\n40.8/27.5\n40.7/27.9\nWanx2.1-plus\n41.8/31.6\n44.9/30.2\n32.1/28.5\n40.6/30.4\n44.7/32.3\n42.1/31.2\n40.8/30.1\n41.5/30.8\nCmOS(Wanx2.1-turbo)\n59.0/40.6\n61.2/42.8\n49.7/37.6\n58.3/38.4\n62.1/42.7\n59.7/40.7\n59.1/39.5\n59.5/40.2\nw / o Discriminator\n58.2/29.3\n59.4/30.9\n49.1/25.6\n54.8/26.9\n60.3/31.1\n57.9/29.3\n56.8/27.7\n57.5/28.8\nw / o Reasoning\n50.8/38.0\n58.8/40.3\n42.0/36.3\n50.9/37.6\n54.0/41.3\n52.5/39.6\n51.7/38.0\n52.3/39.1\nw / o Template\n48.0/41.5\n50.7/44.6\n38.8/36.9\n47.4/40.1\n50.8/43.3\n48.9/41.6\n47.2/40.3\n48.3/41.1\nw / o Tuning\n54.8/31.7\n57.7/35.2\n44.8/29.5\n53.9/30.5\n58.1/35.4\n55.4/33.5\n54.7/31.4\n55.1/32.7\nTable 3: Automatic evaluation results of visual option generation. \u2191: higher is better.\nMethod\nPlaus.\u2191\nDistra.\u2191\nEnga.\u2191\nAVG\u2191\nFlux-schnell\n3.07\n2.99\n3.90\n3.32\nDELLE-3\n3.13\n2.86\n4.20\n3.41\nStableDiffusion-XL\n3.24\n2.82\n4.13\n3.40\nWanx2.1-plus\n3.14\n2.75\n4.11\n3.33\nCmOS(Wanx2.1-turbo)\n3.51\n3.09\n4.17\n3.55\nTable 4: Human evaluation results of visual option gen-\neration. \u2191: higher is better.\ncontent discrimination than predefined standards.\nFinding2: In question generation, as shown in\nTable 1, removing the discriminator leads to BLEU-\n4 and ROUGE-L drops of 2.6 and 5.1, reflecting\nweaker semantic alignment and greater inconsis-\ntency. This indicates that unconvertible inputs dis-\nrupt downstream processing, thereby diminishing\ncoherence and overall quality. For visual option\ngeneration, as shown in Table 3, SSIM remains\nlargely unchanged, whereas CLIP-T decreases by\n11.4, the largest drop among ablations. These re-\nsults indicate that unsuitable inputs hinder the T2I\nmodel\u2019s ability to align images with text.\nFinding3: Table 1 clearly reveals that excluding\nthe OQRM module significantly weakens question\ngeneration, with BLEU-4 plummeting by 33.1 and\nROUGE-L dropping by 7.3. This sharp decline\nunderscores OQRM\u2019s importance in identifying\nquestion-reason pairs with strong lexical and se-\nmantic fidelity to human-written references.\nFinding4: As shown in Table 3, when the rea-\nson generator is removed and distractors are pro-\nduced solely from the question and answer, both\nSSIM and CLIP-T scores decline to varying extents.\nSpecifically, SSIM decreases by 7.2, while CLIP-\nT shows a slight drop of 1.1. This indicates that\nthe inclusion of reasons primarily enhances the vi-\nsual similarity among options, with comparatively\nsmaller effects on image-text alignment.\nFinding5: As shown in Table 3, removing the\ntemplate results in an 11.2 drop in SSIM, while\nCLIP-T scores unexpectedly improve. This diver-\ngence suggests that templates enhance visual con-\nsistency across options but may impose constraints\nthat hinder semantic alignment with textual descrip-\ntions. Further ablation reveals that disabling tuning\nby MLLM and T2I model consistently leads to\nnotable declines in both SSIM (\u22124.4) and CLIP-\nT (\u221212.5), reinforcing the importance of iterative\ntuning strategies for improving intra-option visual\nsimilarity and cross-modal coherence.\n4.6\nCase Study\nTo qualitatively assess the three important mod-\nules in CmOS, Figures 4 and 5 present representative\nexamples from ScienceQA, which include the con-\ntext, an image, and an answer. Without computing\nTotal Match Scores (TMS) across multiple candi-\ndate question-reason pairs to select the one with the\nhighest alignment, the generator tends to generate\nthe most probable question, which often leads to\nsuboptimal performance in question generation.\nTo further examine the effect of the template and\ntuning modules on visual option generation, a com-\nparative example are shown in Figure 5. When the\ntemplate module is incorporated, the generated vi-\nsual options exhibit improved semantic plausibility\nand consistency with object properties. In contrast,\nremoving both the template and tuning modules re-\nsults in outputs that deviate from commonsense ex-\npectations and display stylistic inconsistency. Ad-\nditionally, the example illustrates that the tuning\nprocess enables iterative refinement: even if the ini-\ntial visual option is inadequate, tuning can adjust\nand improve it toward the desired quality. These\nfindings suggest that the template module ensures\nbaseline plausibility, while the tuning supports op-\ntimization, and their combination contributes to\noverall improvements in visual option quality.\n\nContent: \nCompare the average kinetic \nenergies of the particles in each \nsample. \nImage:\nSample A\nQ1: Which sample has particles with \na higher average mass?\nR1: Both samples have particles \nwith an average speed of 1,100 m/s.\nQ2: Which sample has particles with \nthe same average speed as Sample \nA?\nR2: Sample B has particles ... is \nhigher than the 30 u in Sample \nQ3: Which sample has particles with \nhigher kinetic energy?\nR3: Temperature relates to ... so \ngreater kinetic energy \u2192 higher \ntemperature.\nw/o OQRM Q1\nw/ OQRM\nTMS(Q1,R1)=0.22\nTMS(Q2,R2)=0.21\nTMS(Q3,R3)=0.24\nQ3\nOutput First One\nOutput Max TMS(Q3)\nFigure 4: Case in terms of the OQRM module.\nOption: A long bench\nDescription: A long \nwooden bench placed \nhorizontally in a minimal \nindoor space with a \nsmooth gray floor and \nwhite wall.

Meanwhile, we introduce a similar ex-\nemplar retrieval module to guide the discrimination.\nWhat\u2019s more, we use OQRM module to select opti-\nmal question and reasoning progress. Finally, we\nleverage template-based and slight tuning strategies\nto generate educational visual options. Our exper-\nimental results on three test sets demonstrate that\nCmOS outperforms all existing methods and models,\nachieving new state-of-the-art performance. More\nimportantly, our study highlights the potential of\nvisual-option-based multiple-choice question gen-\neration to enhance multimodal teaching resources,\nsupport personalized learning, and foster deeper\nunderstanding in educational settings.\nLimitations\nDespite its promising performance, our proposed\nframework still has two limitations.\nExemplar Resource\nOn one hand, similar to\nCoE framework, our similar exemplar-based strat-\negy for enhancing content discrimination accuracy\nhas an inherent limitation: the dependency on a\nfixed pool of exemplars. When the input content\nfalls outside the distribution of datasets like Sci-\nenceQA, the retrieved exemplars may exhibit low\nsemantic similarity, leading to degraded discrimi-\nnation performance. To mitigate this, future work\ncould explore adaptive retrieval mechanisms or aug-\nment the exemplar pool with more diverse, domain-\ngeneral instances, possibly using synthetic data or\ncontinual learning techniques to improve general-\nization beyond the source domain.\nVisual Option Quality\nOn the other hand,\ndespite improvements in text-image alignment\nthrough image templates and lightweight tuning,\nthe generated visual options still suffer from lim-\nited visual detail, occasional content hallucinations,\nand inconsistent style. Human evaluation (Table 4)\nshows relatively low scores in plausibility and dis-\ntractibility, indicating that some generated visual\noptions are semantically weak, visually indistinct,\nor pedagogically uninformative, thereby limiting\ntheir effectiveness in supporting deep cognitive\nprocessing or engaging prior knowledge. These\nissues stem from the use of general-purpose im-\nage generation models that are not optimized for\neducational applications, often resulting in irrele-\nvant, ambiguous, or stylistically incoherent outputs.\nFuture work could fine-tune generation models on\ncurated educational datasets and apply task-specific\nconstraints or multimodal alignment objectives to\nimprove clarity, visual contrast, semantic accuracy,\nand pedagogical value.\nEthics Statement\nWe comply with institutional ethical guidelines\nthroughout this study. No private or non-public\ndata was used. For human annotation (Sections 4.3\nand 4.4), six annotators were recruited from the\nschools of education at local universities via public\nadvertisements, with clear disclosure of compen-\nsation terms. All annotators were senior under-\ngraduate or graduate students in education-related\nprograms who participated on a part-time basis.\nEach annotator was compensated at a rate of 55\nCNY per hour, which exceeds the local minimum\nhourly wage for part-time employment in 2025\n(23.5 CNY/hour). The annotation process did not\ninvolve any personally sensitive information.\n\nSample A Sample B\n\nMass of each particle: 28 u Mass of each particle: 32 u\n\nHaverage particle speed: 1.100 mis \u2018Average particle speed: 1.100 mi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\nNaveed Afzal and Ruslan Mitkov. 2014.\nAuto-\nmatic generation of multiple choice questions using\ndependency-based semantic relations.

Educa-\ntional question generation of children storybooks via\nquestion type distribution learning and event-centric\nsummarization. arXiv preprint arXiv:2203.14187.\nA\nRelated Works\nEducational question is an indispensable compo-\nnent of instructional resources, serving multiple\nfunctions including assessment, guidance, feed-\nback, and the promotion of active learning (Tofade\net al., 2013; Thalheimer, 2014). However, manu-\nally authoring educational questions is a complex\nand resource-intensive task that requires profes-\nsional training, domain knowledge, and instruc-\ntional experience (Davis, 2009; Kim et al., 2012).\nTo address the high cost and inefficiency associated\nwith manual question generation, Automatic Ques-\ntion Generation (AQG) technologies have emerged\n\nas a promising solution (Brown et al., 2005), and\nhave been widely applied in dialogue systems (Gao\net al., 2019; Gu et al., 2021; Bulathwela et al., 2023)\nand intelligent tutoring systems (Kulshreshtha et al.,\n2022; Xu et al., 2022; Yadav et al., 2023), becom-\ning a prominent research focus within the field of\nArtificial Intelligence in Education to support per-\nsonalized learning (Bulathwela et al., 2023; Fawzi\net al., 2024; Lamsiyah et al., 2024).\nB\nDataset Details\nFigure 8 shows four datasets distribution across 3\nsubjects (NAT, SOC, LAN), 2 modalities (IMG,\nTXT), and 2 grade ranges (G1-6, G7-12). Question\ntypes: NAT = natural science, SOC = social science,\nLAN = language science, TXT = only containing\ntext, IMG = containing image, G1-6 = grades 1-6,\nG7-12 = grades 7-12. For DO, NAT has 2, 252,\nSOC 1, 100, and LAN 889; IMG has 2, 224 and\nTXT 2, 017; G1-6 has 2, 723 and G7-12 has 1, 518.\nFor DE, NAT has 257, SOC 128, and LAN 97;\nIMG has 228 and TXT 254; G1-6 has 309 and G7-\n12 has 173. For DC, NAT has 1, 990, SOC 969,\nand LAN 787; IMG has 1, 795 and TXT 1, 964;\nG1-6 has 2, 723 and G7-12 has 1, 036. For DQ,\nNAT has 576, SOC 236; IMG has 571 and TXT\n241; G1-6 has 568 and G7-12 has 244.\nC\nImplementation Details\nTo ensure fair and reproducible evaluation of visual\noption generation baselines, we report the detailed\nsettings of all off-the-shelf generative models used\nin our experiments. As part of our pipeline, we em-\nploy Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct (Bai et al., 2023) for\ncontent discrimination, question generation, and\nthe production of visual option descriptions. More-\nover, we uniformly set the decoding parameters to\ntop-p = 0.8 and temperature = 0.7. To generate\ncorresponding images, we use Wanx2.1-turbo as\nour main image synthesis backbone. Additionally,\nwe utilize the robust Contrastive Language\u2013Image\nPretraining model FARE (Schlarmann et al., 2024)\nfor retrieval and evaluation.

Table 7\nshows that CmOS consistently outperforms SOTA\nmethods in question generation under the ME-\nTEOR metric. While its score in the language sci-\nences (LAN) is lower than in natural (NAT) and\nsocial sciences (SOC), it still significantly exceeds\nother methods. This suggests that CmOS generates\nsemantically aligned questions, aided by its multi-\nquestion filtering strategy.\nMoreover, MultiQG-TI and Multimodal-CoT\n51.4\n57.1\n60.9\n78.2\n74.0\n69.2\n64.5\n0.0 \n20.0 \n40.0 \n60.0 \n80.0 \n\u03b1=0.1\n\u03b1=0.2\n\u03b1=0.4\n\u03b1=0.6\n\u03b1=0.8\n\u03b1=1.0\n\u03b1=1.2\nBLEU-4\nROUGE-L\nMETEOR\nAVG\nFigure 6: The overall performance of question genera-\ntion with varying \u03b1.\nthat are fine-tuned with CoT prompting, achieve\nbetter performance than VL-T5. Although VL-\nT5 benefits from stronger visual understanding, it\nlags behind in semantic coherence during ques-\ntion generation. In contrast, CoE leverages Chain\nof Exemplar reasoning to further enhance its gen-\neration quality, outperforming both MultiQG-TI\nand Multimodal-CoT. Additionally, the table in-\ncludes results for CHATGPT under zero-shot and\nfew-shot settings. While CHATGPT benefits from\nincreased contextual exemplars and achieves ME-\nTEOR scores that approach those of some base-\nlines, it still falls considerably short of CmOS in mul-\ntimodal question generation, highlighting its limi-\ntations in complex reasoning and visual-semantic\nintegration.\nSimilarly, we evaluated the performance of\nCmOS after removing the Optimal Question-Reason\nMatch (OQRM) module.\nA noticeable perfor-\nmance drop was observed, with the average ME-\nTEOR score decreasing by 17.3 points. This result\nhighlights the importance of OQRM in enhancing\nthe semantic alignment between generated ques-\ntions and questions authored by humans.\nE\nHyperparameter Analysis\nQuestion Generation\nTo determine the optimal hyperparameter \u03b1 for\nselecting the best question-reason pair, we system-\natically examined the BLEU and ROUGE-L scores\nacross varying values of \u03b1 from 0.1 to 1.2 in steps\nof 0.1 or 0.2. What\u2019s more, we sampled 300 in-\nstances from Dc where the value of \"convertible\"\nis true, ensuring no overlap with the dataset DQ.\nAs shown in Figure 6, both scores exhibit a trend\nof first increasing and then decreasing. Notably,\nBLEU-4, ROUGE-L and METEOR reach their\npeak values when \u03b1 = 0.6.

Therefore, we select \u03b1 = 0.6 as the\noptimal value.\nVisual Option Generation\nTo determine the optimal hyperparameter \u03b2 for\nbalancing the influence of the image itself and its\ncaption during template retrieval, we systemati-\ncally evaluated the changes in structural similarity\n(SSIM) and text-image similarity (CLIP-T) scores\nfor the generated visual options across different\nvalues of \u03b2. As shown in the Figure 7, \u03b2 was\ngradually increased from 0.4 to 1.8 in increments\nof 0.2. The results indicate that both SSIM and\nCLIP-T scores exhibit a trend of initially increas-\ning and then decreasing as \u03b2 increases. Specifically,\nwhen \u03b2 = 1.4, the SSIM score reaches its peak at\n59.3, and the CLIP-T score also achieves its high-\nest value of 40.4. Therefore, we select \u03b2 = 1.4\nas the optimal value within the range of our exper-\nimental settings for the subsequent visual option\ngeneration task.\nF\nAnalysis of Question Diversity\nWe adopt Distinct-n scores to evaluate the diversity\nof questions generated. Specifically, this metric cal-\nculates the number of unique n-grams at the corpus\nlevel, where higher values indicate greater diver-\nsity. We consider values of n ranging from 1 to\n4. As shown in the table 5, overall performance\nimproves with increasing n. Both CHATGPT\u2019s 0-\nshot and few-shot settings exhibit relatively high\nquestion diversity. Aside from CHATGPT, CmOS\nonly falls slightly behind CoE on Distinct-1, while\nit surpasses the baseline methods on other three\nmetrics. When compared to the Groundtruth, we\nfind that both CoE and CmOS achieve scores close to\nhuman-generated questions, suggesting that these\ntwo methods better approximate the style and dis-\ntribution of human-authored question diversity.\nMethod\nDistinct-1\nDistinct-2\nDistinct-3\nDistinct-4\n0shot\n19.68\n38.32\n49.89\n58.81\n1shot\n18.46\n34.16\n44.49\n53.32\n3shot\n17.21\n30.80\n39.95\n47.93\nVL-T5\n12.11\n23.95\n30.93\n37.74\nMultiQG-TI\n13.39\n24.54\n31.63\n38.02\nMultimodal-CoT\n15.92\n23.31\n36.20\n40.47\nCoE\n17.20\n29.47\n38.18\n45.74\nCmOS\n16.85\n34.65\n40.72\n47.22\nGrondtruth\n17.41\n31.56\n40.46\n47.97\nTable 5: Distinct-n results of different methods.\nG\nAnalysis of Different Base Models\nTo analyse the generality of CmOS, we conduct an\nexperiment to utilize other base models in place of\nQWEN2.5-VL-7B-INSTRUCT as the backbone for\nquestion and visual option generation, including\nLLAMA3.2-11B-VISION (Grattafiori et al., 2024),\nLLAVA (Lu et al., 2022), INSTRUCTBLIP (Dai\net al., 2023), MPLUG-OWL (Ye et al., 2024), and\nVISUALGLM-6B (Du et al., 2022). Note that we\nemploy the same prompt for all base models to en-\nsure fairness in the comparison. As summarized\nin Table 9, QWEN2.5-VL-7B-INSTRUCT outper-\nforms all the rest base models, showcasing its high\napplicability and suitability in our framework.

However, some ques-\ntions posed to LRMs are inherently unanswerable, such as\nmath problems lacking sufficient conditions. We find that\nLRMs continually fail to provide appropriate abstentions when\nconfronted with these unanswerable questions. In this paper,\nwe systematically analyze, investigate, and resolve this issue\nfor trustworthy AI. We first conduct a detailed analysis of the\ndistinct response behaviors of LRMs when facing unanswer-\nable questions. Then, we show that LRMs possess sufficient\ncognitive capabilities to recognize the flaws in these questions.\nHowever, they fail to exhibit appropriate abstention behav-\nior, revealing a misalignment between their internal cognition\nand external response. Finally, to resolve this issue, we pro-\npose a lightweight, two-stage method that combines cognitive\nmonitoring with inference-time intervention. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our method significantly improves\nthe abstention rate while maintaining the overall reasoning\nperformance.\n1\nIntroduction\nLarge reasoning models (LRMs), such as GPT-o1 (Jaech\net al. 2024) and DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al. 2025),\nhave demonstrated strong performance on complex reasoning\ntasks (Xu et al. 2025). By introducing the concept of \u201cthought\u201d\nand generating longer chains of thought (CoT), LRMs are\nable to explore diverse reasoning paths while spontaneously\nreflecting and correcting errors. This enables LRMs to tackle\ncomplex tasks with greater depth and flexibility, which is\nparticularly valuable in high-stakes reasoning scenarios.\nMost current research on LRMs focuses on improving\nthe reasoning process for solving complex problems (Xu\net al. 2025), such as reducing redundant reasoning steps to\nalleviate overthinking (Dang, Huang, and Chen 2025; Yang\net al. 2025b) and refining the reasoning process to further\nenhance reasoning performance (Chen et al. 2025; Liao et al.\n2025). However, limited work has considered that not all\ncomplex questions are answerable (Kirichenko et al. 2025;\nSong, Shi, and Zhao 2025). When confronted with noisy and\ndiverse user queries, there will always be cases where LRMs\nare unable to produce reliable responses, such as the math\nproblems missing sufficient conditions.\n*Corresponding author\nThe operation \u2297is used to combine two nonzero numbers\nby a \u2297b = a\u00b2/b. Determine [(1 \u22972) \u22973] - [1 \u2297(2 \u22973)]. \nGive me the final answer. If you can\u2019t solve it, just say \u201cI \ndon\u2019t know\u201d and tell me why.\n<think> Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to figure\nout [(1 \u22972) \u22973] - [1 \u2297(2 \u22973)], where \u2297is an operation\nthat combines two nonzero numbers by adding them. So,\nthe left side is 1 \u22972 = 3, then 3 \u22973 = 6. The right side is 2\n\u22973 = 5, then 1 \u22975 = 6. So, the final answer is 6 - 6 = 0. \n</think> The final answer is 0.\n<think> Okay, I need to evaluate [(1 \u22972) \u22973] - [1 \u2297(2 \n\u22973)], but I don\u2019t know what \u2297actually does. It just says it \ncombines two nonzero numbers \u2014 that\u2019s not enough.\n</think> Since \u2297is undefined, we can\u2018t determine the exact \nvalue of the expression. There\u2019s not enough information to \nsolve the problem. The final answer is \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. \nAbstention\nsuccess\nAbstention \nfailure\nmissing\nHallucinated answer\nFigure 1: Examples of abstention failure and success for\nLRMs on unanswerable questions.\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, when a question is unanswer-\nable due to missing necessary conditions, we prefer LRMs\nto reason about why it cannot be answered and have the\nability to abstain by responding with \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d (i.e., ab-\nstention success), rather than generating a reasoning process\nwith hallucination and arriving at an incorrect answer (i.e.,\nabstention failure). Since model reliability is foundational\nto user trust, LRMs need to possess both strong reasoning\nabilities and the capacity to abstain from answering unan-\nswerable questions (Kirichenko et al. 2025; Song, Shi, and\nZhao 2025). We first validate the phenomenon that LRMs\noften struggle to abstain. As shown in Figure 2, we evaluate\nseveral LRMs on SUM (Song, Shi, and Zhao 2025), which\ncontains mathematical unanswerable questions. Our results\nshow that most LRMs fail to abstain on more than half of\nthe examples. To address the above issue, we systematically\nanalyze, investigate, and propose solutions to improve the\nabstention behavior for LRMs.\nFirst, to understand how LRMs fail to abstain, we analyze\nthree types of responses generated by LRMs when faced with\nunanswerable questions. We find that LRMs exhibit two types\nof behavior when they fail to abstain. Further, we explore\ntheir awareness of unanswerable questions. We conduct anal-\nysis on LRMs at both external level (intermediate responses\nduring reasoning) and internal level (latent representations).\narXiv:2508.18760v1  [cs.AI]  26 Aug 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17.9 \n22.4 \n35.0 \n45.2 \n52.5 \n82.1 \n77.6 \n65.0 \n54.8 \n47.5 \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nR1-Distill-Llama-8B R1-Distill-Qwen-7B R1-Distill-Qwen-14B\nQwen3-8B\nQwen3-14B\nAbstention success\nAbstention failure\nFigure 2: Abstention performance comparison of different\nLRMs for unanswerable questions on the SUM dataset.\nWe find that LRMs possess sufficient cognitive capabilities\nto recognize flaws in such questions. This reveals a misalign-\nment between internal cognition and external output: a LRM\ninternally realizes that a question is unanswerable, yet still\nfails to act on this realization and abstain accordingly. An-\nswering the unanswerable is to err knowingly.\nSecond, we seek to improve the abstention ability of LRMs\nfor unanswerable questions. Our further analysis shows that\nalthough LRMs may internally exhibit a tendency to ab-\nstain during reasoning, such signals are generally not strong\nenough to interrupt reasoning and result in abstention. Based\non this insight, we propose a method that combines cognitive\nmonitoring with inference-time intervention, aiming to im-\nprove LRMs\u2019 ability to abstain from unanswerable questions\nwhile preserving their reasoning abilities on answerable ones.\nFinally, we conduct extensive experiments with two\ndatasets using LRMs from various model families and scales.\nOur method enhances LRMs\u2019 ability to abstain from answer-\ning unanswerable questions without degrading their reason-\ning on answerable ones. Furthermore, our experiments reveal\nthat different types of abstention failures benefit from differ-\nent intervention strategies. Our method achieves significant\nimprovements across all failure types. We will open-source\nour code to facilitate future research.\n2\nRelated Work\nLLM Abstention on Unanswerable Questions.\nAs the\ndemand for more reliable language models grows, the ability\nof LLMs to abstain from answering unanswerable questions\nhas become an important evaluation criterion (Yin et al. 2023;\nAmayuelas et al. 2024; Madhusudhan et al. 2025; Sun et al.\n2024; Tomani et al. 2024). LRMs have attracted attention\nfor their strong performance on reasoning tasks (Yang et al.\n2025b; Fu et al. 2025). However, their behavior on unanswer-\nable questions has been less studied. Prior work (Kirichenko\net al. 2025; Song, Shi, and Zhao 2025) finds that LRMs show\nweaker abstention ability. In our work, we further provide a\nmore detailed analysis of the different types of outputs pro-\nduced by LRMs when faced with unanswerable questions.\nWe show that LRMs often have an internal understanding of\na problem\u2019s solvability but fail to express it through explicit\nabstention. Based on this insight, we propose a method to\nimprove their abstention behavior.\nInference-Time Improvements for LRMs.\nWhile LRMs\nbenefit from richer chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and\nachieve strong performance on complex tasks, recent efforts\nhave explored inference-time interventions to further enhance\ntheir reasoning accuracy and efficiency (Chen et al. 2025;\nDang, Huang, and Chen 2025). For example, (Fu et al. 2025)\nand (Li et al. 2024) monitor intermediate consistency be-\ntween reasoning steps to decide when to output the answer.\n(Yang et al. 2025b) estimates confidence in intermediate steps\nto decide whether the model has reached a sufficiently certain\nconclusion. (Liao et al. 2025) uses process-level reward mod-\nels to guide the model toward better reasoning trajectories.\nHowever, the above methods are designed for answerable\nquestions. In our work, we evaluate their effectiveness on\nunanswerable questions and propose a new inference-time\nintervention to improve the abstention capability for LRMs.\n3\nAnalysis of Abstention Failure\nIn this section, we begin by analyzing how LRMs respond\nto unanswerable math problems. We then investigate LRMs\u2019\nawareness of unanswerable questions by examining whether\nthey possess the ability to recognize the unanswerability of\nsuch questions, from both internal and external perspectives.\nLRMs.\nWe evaluate five LRMs across diverse model fam-\nilies and scales, including R1-Distill-Llama-8B, R1-Distill-\nQwen-7B, R1-Distill-Qwen-14B (DeepSeek-AI et al. 2025),\nQwen3-8B, and Qwen3-14B (Yang et al. 2025a).\nDatasets.\nFollowing previous work (Song, Shi, and Zhao\n2025; Ouyang 2025), we focus on unanswerable math prob-\nlems, i.e., ill-posed problems that are challenging for LRMs\nand offer objectively defined criteria for unanswerability.\nSpecifically, we use the Synthetic Unanswerable Math (SUM)\n(Song, Shi, and Zhao 2025) dataset, which includes diverse\nproblems from AIME (1984\u20132023), AMC (pre-2023), Omni-\nMATH (Gao et al. 2025), and Still (Team 2025). The unan-\nswerable problems in SUM are generated based on five crite-\nria: (1) key information deletion, (2) ambiguous key informa-\ntion, (3) unrealistic conditions, (4) unrelated objects, and (5)\nquestion deletion. We randomly sample 1,000 problems for\nour analysis. For each unanswerable case, we use GPT-4o to\ngenerate a brief explanation as the ground-truth rationale.\nObjective and Prompt.\nGiven a question, we encourage\nthe LRM to perform normal reasoning when the question\nis answerable, and to respond with \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d along\nwith a corresponding explanation when it is not (i.e., correct\nabstention). The prompt used in this task is shown in Figure 3.\n{Question} Let\u2019s think step by step and output the final answer within \\boxed{}. \nPlease solve the problem strictly based on the information provided. Do not \nintroduce any additional assumptions. If you believe the problem lacks sufficient \ninformation or is unsolvable, first reply with \\boxed{I don\u2019t know.}, and then \nprovide your corresponding reason in the format: Reason {your explanation here}.\nPrompt\nFigure 3: Prompt used for math problems.\n3.1\nReactions to Unanswerable Questions\nIn this section, we evaluate the reactions of LRMs to unan-\nswerable questions using the prompts in Figure 3 with a\nmaximum token budget of 10,000 per response. We identify\nthree distinct response types, as shown in Figures 4:\n\n<think>\\nOkay, so I have this problem here: I need to figure out [(1 \u22972) \u22973] \nminus [1 \u2297(2 \u22973)], where \u2297is some operation that combines two nonzero \nnumbers.

Our two-layered analysis assesses (1) be-\nhavioral signals: whether LRMs outwardly indicate question\nanswerability, and (2) latent signals: whether answerability\nis internally encoded during reasoning.\nBehavioral Signals of Question Answerability.\nInspired\nby prior work (Yang et al. 2025b; Chen et al. 2025; Wang\net al. 2025) showing that LRMs form and revise intermediate\nconclusions during reasoning, we insert stopping points into\nthe reasoning trajectory. At each stopping point, we prompt\nthe LRM to (1) directly provide an answer, and (2) to explain\nwhy the question is unanswerable (details in the appendix).\nWe apply this intervention to the two failure types. For\n\u201ccognitive fixation\u201d, we use the keyword \u201cwait\u201d as a stopping\npoint and prompt the model to directly output its answer. For\n\u201challucinated answer\u201d, which typically have shorter reasoning\ntrajectories, we use \u201c\\n\\n\u201d as the stopping point. We then\ncompute the proportion of questions in each category where\nthe model can respond with a correct abstention at stopping\npoints. As shown in Figure 6, for cognitive fixation, more\nthan half of the cases can result in correct abstentions. A\nnotable portion of hallucinated answer cases receive correct\nabstentions, and the rate improves as model size increases.\nSince \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d is a simple response and may be\nproduced randomly, we additionally prompt the LRMs at\neach stopping point to explain why the question is unanswer-\nable, to better assess their awareness of unanswerability. We\nmeasure the percentage of questions in each category with\ncorrect explanations.

The linear representation hypothesis posits\nthat high-level concepts, such as language, gender, and truth-\nfulness, are linearly embedded in the latent space of LLMs\n(Park, Choe, and Veitch 2024). We hypothesize that question\nanswerability may also be linearly represented during the\nreasoning process. Inspired by prior work on representation\nprobing (Li et al. 2023; Orgad et al. 2025; Marks and Tegmark\n2023; Slobodkin et al. 2023), we train lightweight linear clas-\nsifiers (probes) on hidden activations from the LRMs\u2019 reason-\ning trajectory. The goal is to assess whether answerable and\nunanswerable questions can be distinguished from latent rep-\nresentations during the reasoning process, thereby revealing\nthe presence of answerability-related signals in internal state.\nWe use the output of the multi-head attention before the\nresidual connection as the input to the probe (Li et al. 2023):\nxc\nl =\nH\nX\nh=1\nQh\nl Atth\nl (P h\nl xl),\n(1)\nwhere xl is the input of layer l, P h\nl projects the input into a\nhead-specific subspace, Qh\nl maps it back, Att is the attention\noperator. The probe is defined as a simple linear classifier:\np\u03b8(xc\nl ) = \u03c3(\u27e8\u03b8, xc\nl \u27e9), where \u03b8 is the trainable weight and \u03c3\ndenotes the sigmoid function. One probe is trained per layer.\nWe sample 2,200 pairs of answerable and unanswerable\nquestions from the SUM dataset (2,000 pairs for training\nand 200 for validation). For each question, we randomly\nsample 1,000 token-level activations xc\nl from the reasoning\ntrajectory, and construct a dataset\n\b\n(xc\nl , y)i\n\tN\ni=1, where y \u2208\n{0, 1} indicates question answerability. At inference time, we\naggregate the prediction probabilities across all tokens up to\nthe current reasoning step and use the average as the overall\nanswerability prediction. We select the optimal probing layer\nfor each model based on the validation set, and evaluate on\nthe test dataset used for analysis in the previous section.\nThe results are shown in Figure 8, where we plot the\nprobe\u2019s classification accuracy at various percentages of the\n86.86\n84.65\n88.24\n92.55\n94.76\n73.93\n75.15\n80.34\n83.84\n85.09\n73.81\n70.12\n75.33\n79.62\n82.61\n40\n60\n80\n100\nR1-Distill-Llama-8B R1-Distill-Qwen-7B R1-Distill-Qwen-14B\nQwen3-8B\nQwen3-14B\nCorrect abstention\nHallucinated answer\nCognitive fixation\nAbstention confidence\nFigure 9: The confidence of abstention answer: \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d\nin different types of response.\n70.05\n71.22\n78.93\n79.89\n86.95\n7.8\n5.86\n36.6\n14.31\n18.23\n23.47\n10.18\n27.81\n11.39\n15.15\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nR1-Distill-Llama-8B R1-Distill-Qwen-7B R1-Distill-Qwen-14B\nQwen3-8B\nQwen3-14B\nCorrect abstention\nHallucinated answer\nCognitive fixation\nAbstention frequency\nFigure 10: The frequency of abstention responses across\nstopping points in different types of response outcomes.\nreasoning process, using a 0.5 threshold to distinguish unan-\nswerable (prediction probability of probe > 0.5) from an-\nswerable cases. For all LRMs, we observe that the probe\u2019s\nclassification accuracy increases steadily as reasoning pro-\ngresses, with most accuracies exceeding 0.8 by the end of the\ntrajectory. These results suggest that signals related to ques-\ntion answerability are indeed encoded in the representations\nof LRMs during reasoning. Although these signals may not\nalways be reflected in the LRMs\u2019 final output behavior, they\nare implicitly present in the internal computation process.\n4\nMitigation of Abstention Failure\nIn this section, we seek to mitigate abstention failures of\nLRMs when faced with unanswerable questions.\n4.1\nMotivation\nAs previously discussed, although LRMs show signs of recog-\nnizing unanswerable questions during reasoning, they often\nfail to abstain in their final answers. We aim to identify the\ncauses of this misalignment and explore ways to fix it.\nFirst, we examine the LRMs\u2019 confidence (Kuhn, Gal, and\nFarquhar 2023) in abstaining at the stopping point across\nthree output types. We sample an equal number of questions\nfrom each output type and compute the average confidence in\ngenerating \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d at the stopping points. Following\n(Yang et al. 2025b), the confidence score C is computed as\np(at) = P(at | H, I, a<t), C =\n n\nX\ni=1\nmax\nat\u2208V p(at)\n! 1\nn\n, (2)\nwhere p(at) denotes the model\u2019s predicted probability of\nanswer token at, H includes the input prompt and the gen-\nerated thoughts, I is the prompt used to elicit the answer, n\nis the number of decoding steps, and V is the vocabulary.\nAs shown in Figure 9, the types of hallucinated answer and\ncognitive fixation both exhibit lower confidence in abstention\ncompared to the type of correct abstention.\nNext, we analyze the average frequency of \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d\noutputs by the LRMs across all stopping points in the rea-\nsoning trajectory. As shown in Figure 10, the hallucinated\n\nttt att Pitt tt ri ee lteter oleate\n\n\nMethod\nSUM\nUMWP\nUnanswerable\nAnswerable\nUnanswerable\nAnswerable\nAbstention \u2191\nReason Acc \u2191\nToken \u2193\nAnswer Acc \u2191\nToken \u2193\nAbstention \u2191\nReason Acc \u2191\nToken \u2193\nAnswer Acc \u2191\nToken \u2193\nR1-Distill-Llama-8B\nVanilla\n16.90%\n14.44\n5088\n61.97\n3446\n30.67%\n26.00\n1829\n77.67\n613\nDynasor-CoT\n35.92%\n27.82\n3084\n55.28\n2619\n39.33%\n30.67\n958\n73.33\n495\nDEER\n24.30%\n19.79\n4339\n60.92\n2675\n34.11%\n28.67\n1616\n77.67\n637\nOurs\n60.92%\n53.17\n2419\n60.92\n3151\n54.67%\n44.00\n1246\n77.33\n574\nR1-Distill-Qwen-7B\nVanilla\n21.13%\n19.37\n4878\n69.72\n3169\n47.67%\n43.67\n1935\n90.30\n597\nDynasor-CoT\n56.34%\n45.89\n1869\n62.68\n2074\n64.33%\n53.00\n763\n88.67\n486\nDEER\n28.87%\n25.70\n3747\n63.73\n2191\n54.33%\n49.33\n1335\n91.67\n590\nOurs\n73.94%\n61.86\n2247\n67.25\n3001\n77.33%\n64.33\n1256\n90\n569\nR1-Distill-Qwen-14B\nVanilla\n36.97%\n33.45\n3820\n70.42\n2671\n49.67%\n45.00\n539\n90.00\n384\nDynasor-CoT\n51.17%\n45.18\n2622\n66.20\n2029\n50.67%\n46.00\n504\n90.00\n384\nDEER\n39.79%\n36.97\n3417\n63.75\n2303\n50.33%\n46.67\n644\n90.33\n532\nOurs\n74.30%\n62.68\n2621\n67.96\n2541\n60.33%\n54.33\n606\n89.67\n388\nQwen3-8B\nVanilla\n47.18%\n41.90\n4411\n60.92\n4245\n80.00%\n72.33\n1906\n94.33\n1317\nDynasor-CoT\n65.61%\n58.21\n1710\n60.27\n2190\n83.67%\n75.00\n736\n92.00\n803\nDEER\n63.38%\n51.17\n1902\n63.77\n1993\n80.00%\n70.33\n479\n94.33\n474\nOurs\n75.27%\n64.44\n2912\n61.62\n3875\n87.33%\n79.67\n980\n93.67\n1252\nQwen3-14B\nVanilla\n54.22%\n48.24\n3713\n66.55\n3768\n82.33%\n76.67\n1279\n94.33\n877\nDynasor-CoT\n66.18%\n56.62\n1375\n63.38\n1862\n84.00%\n76.67\n752\n92.67\n662\nDEER\n63.90%\n56.91\n1749\n68.18\n2192\n83.33%\n75.67\n408\n93.00\n447\nOurs\n78.17%\n69.01\n2311\n65.03\n3528\n92.67%\n82.67\n959\n92.48\n848\nTable 1: Performance of methods on (un)answerable questions across LRMs. Best scores are marked in bold.\nanswer and cognitive fixation types consistently show lower\nabstention frequencies than correct abstention.\nAll the findings suggest that while the LRM may recognize\na question as unanswerable, it often lacks sufficient confi-\ndence to act upon it. The gap between internal awareness and\noutput behavior reveals a key misalignment in LRMs: though\nthey may be aware of unanswerability, their decision process\nremains biased toward answering rather than abstaining.\n4.2\nMethod\nMotivated by the above findings, we propose a method to\nhelp LRMs improve their abstention capability. It consists\nof two key components: cognitive monitoring and inference-\ntime intervention. The goal is to monitor the LRM\u2019s evolving\nrecognition of question unanswerability during reasoning,\nand to intervene when necessary to guide the LRM toward\nmaking an abstention by encouraging abstention behaviors.\nCognitive Monitoring.\nThe first step of our method aims\nto identify when the model internally recognizes that a ques-\ntion may be unanswerable. To do so, we track the token-level\nhidden states generated during inference and segment the rea-\nsoning process into semantically coherent units (e.g., clauses\nor transitions marked by discourse cues such as \u201cwait\u201d). At\nthe end of each segment, we apply a lightweight linear probe,\nwhich is trained from our analysis of latent signals of ques-\ntion answerability, to estimate the probability that the current\nquestion is unanswerable. If the predicted probability of unan-\nswerability exceeds a threshold, the model transitions to the\nnext stage: inference-time intervention.\nInstruction:\\n You are not permitted to make assumptions that are not explicitly \nstated in the question. There are signs that this question may lack sufficient \ninformation to answer definitively. If you find that any part of your reasoning \ndepends on undefined operations, missing values, or unspecified conditions, you \nmust immediately stop and output: \\boxed{I don't know.} Do not attempt to \nguess, infer, or continue reasoning with incomplete information. This is a strict \nconstraint! \\n</think>\\n\\n\nIntervention Prompt\nFigure 11: The prompt used for inference-time intervention.\nInference-Time Intervention.\nOnce the LRM exhibits suf-\nficient internal evidence that a question is unanswerable, we\nintervene the reasoning process to reinforce this recognition\nand increase the likelihood of a correct abstention. The inter-\nvention is implemented via an instructional guidance prompt\n(see Figure 11). We append a prompt that restates the possibil-\nity that the question may be unanswerable, helping the LRM\novercome cognitive fixation and avoid speculative guesses\nbased on missing or unstated information. Inspired by prior\nwork (Yang et al. 2025b; Fu et al. 2025), we also incorporate\nan early exit strategy to prevent unnecessary continuation of\nreasoning. It is designed to be minimally intrusive yet seman-\ntically salient, encouraging the model to consider abstention\nas a valid and even preferred option under certain conditions.\n5\nExperiments\n5.1\nSetup\nDatasets.\nWe use SUM (Song, Shi, and Zhao 2025) and\nUMWP (Sun et al. 2024).

Proportions are\nreported across models and datasets, with numbers indicating absolute changes from the vanilla model.\nwhich contains 284 unanswerable and 284 answerable ques-\ntions manually verified. UMWP is derived from four widely\nused math word problem datasets: SVAMP (Patel, Bhat-\ntamishra, and Goyal 2021), MultiArith (Koncel-Kedziorski\net al. 2016), GSM8K (Cobbe et al. 2021), and ASDiv (Miao,\nLiang, and Su 2020). The full dataset consists of 5,200 in-\nstances. We sample 600 questions (300 unanswerable and\n300 answerable) to form the test set. For the unanswerable\nquestions in UMWP, we also use GPT-4o to generate the\nreasoning behind their unanswerability as ground truth.\nMetrics.\nFollowing previous works (Song, Shi, and Zhao\n2025; Kirichenko et al. 2025), we evaluate model perfor-\nmance using the following metrics. (1) Abstention Rate: The\nproportion of unanswerable questions for which the model\ncorrectly abstains from answering by outputting \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow\u201d in accordance with the instruction. (2) Reason Accu-\nracy: The percentage of unanswerable questions for which\nthe model provides the correct rationale for unanswerability.\n(3) Token Usage: The number of tokens generated by the\nmodel during the reasoning process. (4) Answer Accuracy:\nThe proportion of answerable questions for which the model\nproduces the correct final answer.\nBaselines and LRMs.\nOur method is an inference-time\nintervention for LRMs without training. There are no directly\ncomparable baselines. We select two baselines based on out-\nput consistency (Dynasor-CoT) and confidence (DEER), as-\nsuming that correct abstention is the correct answer for unan-\nswerable questions. Dynasor-CoT (Fu et al. 2025) prompts\nintermediate answers and halts when the same answer ap-\npears three times consecutively. DEER (Yang et al. 2025b)\nmonitors sentence-level confidence and exits early once a\nthreshold is met. Besides, the Vanilla method denotes un-\naltered LRM outputs. For LRMs, we choose five models:\nR1-Distill-Llama-8B, R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, R1-Distill-Qwen-\n14B, Qwen3-8B, and Qwen3-14B. Implementation details\nand full results for all datasets and LRMs are in the appendix.\n5.2\nMain Results\nTable 1 shows the main results. We have the following obser-\nvations: (1) Our method achieves the highest Abstention Rate\nand Reason Accuracy on unanswerable questions, demon-\nstrating its strong ability to guide LRMs in recognizing and\nabstaining from unanswerable inputs. (2) Our method main-\ntains comparable Answer Accuracy on answerable questions.\nIn most settings, accuracy remains close to the vanilla model\nand sometimes improves slightly, indicating minimal impact\non solving answerable tasks. (3) Our method can reduce token\nusage on unanswerable questions, with an average reduction\nof 30\u201350% across different LRMs compared to the vanilla\nmodel. It also slightly decreases token consumption on an-\nswerable questions, indicating improved reasoning efficiency.\n(4) We observe a positive correlation between Abstention\nRate and Reason Accuracy: as the LRM becomes better at ab-\nstaining from unanswerable questions, it also produces more\naccurate explanations. This suggests that the intervention not\nonly changes the final output but also improves intermedi-\nate reasoning quality. (5) Qwen3 models generally outper-\nform distillation-based models in abstention-related metrics.\nLarger LRMs tend to exhibit stronger abstention capabilities.\nThis trend indicates that both model scale and architecture\ncontribute to reliable unanswerability detection.\n5.3\nFurther Discussions\nImpact on Response Type Distribution.\nWe analyze the\nchanges in the proportions of different response types across\nmethods and datasets, as shown in Figure 12. Our method\nconsistently reduces the hallucinated answers and cognitive\nfixation outputs. This reduction directly contributes to a sub-\nstantial increase in the rate of correct abstentions. While both\nDynasor-CoT and DEER employ early-exit strategies to miti-\ngate cognitive fixation, we observe that such baselines often\nlead to a higher proportion of hallucinated answers. Early\nexits without appropriate guidance may cause the model\nto make up assumptions or imagined scenarios for giving\na definite answer, rather than acknowledging uncertainty.\nThis highlights the importance of combining monitoring with\nguided intervention to steer LRMs toward proper behavior.\nIntervention Effects.\nWe assess how our intervention in-\nfluences the LRM\u2019s confidence in abstention and its actual\nabstention behavior, in order to evaluate whether our method\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod\nSUM\nUMWP\nAbst. conf.\nAbst. rate\nAbst. conf.\nAbst. rate\nR1-Distill-Llama-8B\nPre-Interv.\n79.7\n30.1%\n84.1\n41.5%\nPost-Interv.\n87.3 (\u21919.4%)\n78.1% (\u00d7 2.6)\n90.0 (\u21917.0%)\n81.4% (\u00d7 1.9)\nR1-Distill-Qwen-7B\nPre-Interv.\n77.1\n24.5%\n87.1\n50.8%\nPost-Interv.\n86.8 (\u219112.6%)\n80.6% (\u00d7 3.3)\n92.1 (\u21915.7%)\n71.5% (\u00d7 1.4)\nQwen3-8B\nPre-Interv.\n90.9\n48.3%\n90.6\n75.9%\nPost-Interv.\n98.9 (\u21918.7%)\n74.9% (\u00d7 1.5)\n98.1 (\u21918.2%)\n93.1% (\u00d7 1.2)\nTable 2: Results of intervention effects. \u201cAbst. conf.\u201d denotes\nthe average abstention confidence when getting the answer\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. \u201cInterv.\u201d is the inference-time intervention.\nhelps bridge the gap between cognitive awareness and absten-\ntion behavior. Specifically, at the intervention point identified\nby our method, we prompt the LRM to generate intermedi-\nate outputs both before and after the intervention. We then\nmeasure two key indicators: the confidence when producing\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d responses, and the proportion of questions\nfor which the model outputs \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. The results are\nshown in Table 2. Our method consistently enhances the con-\nfidence in generating abstention responses. In addition, the\nabstention rate also shows corresponding improvements.\nFurther Analysis of Cognitive Monitoring.\nWe further\nanalyze the cognitive monitoring component of our method\nand compare our default monitoring strategy based on latent\nrepresentations with alternative strategies relying on behav-\nioral signals. The behavioral signal approach monitors the\nLRMs\u2019 intermediate outputs at the end of the paragraph gen-\neration phase (e.g., when it reaches a \u201cwait\u201d token), and uses\nthese outputs to determine whether to trigger an intervention.\nWe investigate three variants: The Direct Behavior strategy\nchecks whether the model\u2019s intermediate output is \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow\u201d and triggers an intervention immediately if so. The\nConsistency strategy triggers intervention only if the model\nproduces \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d in three consecutive intermediate\noutputs (inspired by Dynasor-CoT). The Confidence Score\nstrategy triggers intervention when the model outputs \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow\u201d with a confidence score exceeding a predefined thresh-\nold (inspired by DEER). As shown in Table 3, all monitoring\nstrategies contribute to the improvement in abstention behav-\nior, showing that cognitive monitoring is generally effective.\nAmong them, the strategy based on latent representation sig-\nnals achieves the best and most consistent performance across\ndifferent models and datasets. The Direct Behavior method is\nsimple and works well, but it can be too aggressive and may\nhurt performance on answerable questions.\nAblation Study.\nWe evaluate two aspects of inference-time\nintervention: the instructional guidance prompt and the early\nexit strategy. By removing one component at a time, we ana-\nlyze how each affects abstention behavior and answer quality.\nThe results are shown in Table 4.

In ACL (Findings), 8653\u20138665. Association for Com-\nputational Linguistics.\nA\nEvaluation Details\nA.1\nEvaluation Details of Three Response Types\nIn this section, we provide detailed criteria for evaluating\nthe three types of responses introduced in Section 3.1: cor-\nrect abstention, hallucinated answer, and cognitive fixation.\nThese evaluations are based on model outputs generated in\nresponse to an input prompt shown in Figure 3. The criteria\nare designed for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).\nCorrect abstention\nA model response is considered a cor-\nrect abstention if it satisfies the following conditions:\n1. The model terminates its reasoning process, indicated by\nthe inclusion of the \u201c</think>\u201d keyword in the output.\n2. The model either explicitly includes the phrase \u201cI don\u2019t\nknow\u201d in the answer, or provides an explanation in the\nformat of \u201cReason {}\u201d indicating that the question is\nunanswerable.\nHallucinated answer\nA model response is labeled as a\nhallucinated answer if:\n1. The model ends its reasoning process by including the\n\u201c</think>\u201d keyword.\n2. The model presents a final answer using the \u201c\\boxed{}\u201d\nformat, where the answer is not \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d, and no\naccompanying \u201cReason {}\u201d is given to indicate that the\nquestion is unanswerable.\nCognitive fixation\nA model response is labeled as a cogni-\ntive fixation if, under a token budget of 10,000 tokens:\n1. The model fails to produce the \u201c</think>\u201d keyword to\nterminate its reasoning process.\n2. It does not provide a final answer using the \u201c\\boxed{}\u201d\nformat, nor does it offer an unanswerability explanation\nin the \u201cReason {}\u201d format.\nA.2\nEvaluation Details of Metrics\nThis section provides detailed descriptions of the evaluation\nmetrics introduced in Section 5 of the main text.\nAbstention rate\nThe proportion of questions that receive\nthe correct abstention among all questions. The criteria for\ndetermining a correct abstention are described in Section A.1\nof Appendix.\nReason accuracy\nThe percentage of unanswerable ques-\ntions for which the model provides the correct rationale for\nunanswerability. We use the Qwen3-32B model to perform\nthe evaluation, with the judgment prompt shown in Figure 13.\nI will give you two explanations for why a math problem is unsolvable:\n1.Gold-standard Reason: The correct explanation for why the problem is unsolvable.\n2.Model's Reason: An explanation generated by a model for why the same problem \nis unsolvable.\nYour task is to: Compare the model's reason with the gold-standard reason. \nDetermine whether the model's reason is:\nCorrect: if it captures the same core idea, even if the wording is different or it's only \npartially complete.\nIncorrect: if it misses the key point or gives a wrong explanation.\nOutput Requirement:\nYou must respond only with a JSON object in one of the following two formats (no \nextra text):{\"result\": Correct} or {\"result\": Incorrect}.\nDo not include any other text or explanations in your response.\nGold-standard Reason:{gold-standard reason}\nModel's Reason:{model_reason}. \nYour output is:\nPrompt for Reason Accuracy \nFigure 13: Prompt used for reason accuracy.\n\nYou are a mathematics assistant. Your primary task is to determine whether two \ngiven mathematical expressions or answers are mathematically equivalent, \ndisregarding differences in symbolic notation, LaTeX syntax, or formatting. \nFocus strictly on whether the two expressions represent the same mathematical \nobject, value, or solution.\nPlease consider the following two answer expressions:\n1. {answer1}  2. {answer2}\nDo these two expressions represent the same mathematical object or value?\nIf they are equivalent, return True; otherwise, return False.\nPlease return the result strictly in the following JSON format:\nIf they are equivalent, return: {\"equivalent\": True}\nIf they are not equivalent, return: {\"equivalent\": False}\nPrompt for Answer Accuracy \nFigure 14: Prompt used for answer accuracy.\nAnswer accuracy\nThe proportion of answerable questions\nfor which the model produces the correct final answer. We\nuse the more capable Qwen3-32B model to perform the evalu-\nation, with the specific judgment prompt shown in Figure 14.\nB\nImplementation Details about Experiments\nFor the baselines, we select two methods base on output\nconsistency (Dynasor-CoT) (Fu et al. 2025) and confidence\n(DEER) (Yang et al. 2025b). All the baselines and our method\nare intervention-based methods during the reasoning process.\nWe use the keyword \u201cwait\u201d as a universal stopping token to\ntrigger the intervention across all methods. The prompt used\nto elicit the intermediate answer at the stopping point is: \u201c\\n\n**Final Answer**\\n\\boxed{\u201d. For Dynasor-CoT, we\nprompt intermediate answers and terminate the reasoning\nprocess early when the same answer appears three times con-\nsecutively. For DEER, we prompt intermediate answers and\nterminate the reasoning process early when the confidence\nof the answer exceeds a predefined threshold (set to 0.95\nfollowing the original paper).\nOur method consists of two main components. For Cogni-\ntive Monitoring, we train a lightweight linear probe on 2,000\npairs of answerable and unanswerable questions sampled\nfrom the SUM dataset (Song, Shi, and Zhao 2025), and vali-\ndate it on an additional 200 pairs. For the reasoning process\nof each question, we sample 1,000 token-level activations as\ninput to the probe. The linear probe is trained for 75 epochs\nwith a batch size of 16,384 and a learning rate of 3e-5 (Li\net al. 2023). We evaluate the classification performance of\nthe probe using the full reasoning process on both the SUM\nand UMWP test sets. The results are shown in Table 5, where\nthe F1 score is computed with a threshold of 0.5. The results\ndemonstrate that the probe achieves good classification per-\nformance and generalizes well across datasets. In our method,\nthe probe is used to predict the answerability of a question\nbased on the generated reasoning content during the infer-\nence process. A question is predicted as unanswerable when\nthe probe\u2019s output exceeds a threshold t. We set t = 0.6 for\nthe SUM dataset and t = 0.5 for the UMWP dataset.\nC\nFull Results for Further Discussions\nImpact on Response Type Distribution.\nWe analyze the\nchanges in the proportions of different response types for\ndifferent methods across all LRMs and datasets, as shown\nLRMs\nBest\nLayer\nSUM\nUMWP\nAUROC\nF1\nAUROC\nF1\nR1-Distill-Llama-8B\n22\n0.879\n0.816\n0.871\n0.809\nR1-Distill-Qwen-7B\n17\n0.912\n0.840\n0.926\n0.867\nR1-Distill-Qwen-14B\n30\n0.908\n0.828\n0.930\n0.879\nQwen3-8B\n24\n0.925\n0.857\n0.967\n0.919\nQwen3-14B\n26\n0.936\n0.874\n0.970\n0.918\nTable 5: Classification performance of the probe across dif-\nferent LRMs on the SUM and UMWP datasets.\nin Figure 15. The results are consistent with those presented\nin Section 5.3 of the main text. Our method consistently re-\nduces the hallucinated answers and cognitive fixation outputs.\nThis reduction directly contributes to a substantial increase\nin the rate of correct abstentions. While both Dynasor-CoT\nand DEER employ early-exit strategies to mitigate cognitive\nfixation, we observe that such baselines often lead to a higher\nproportion of hallucinated answers. Early exits without appro-\npriate guidance may cause the model to make up assumptions\nor imagined scenarios for giving a definite answer, rather than\nacknowledging uncertainty. This highlights the importance\nof combining monitoring with guided intervention to steer\nLRMs toward proper behavior.\nIntervention Effects.\nWe assess how our intervention in-\nfluences the LRM\u2019s confidence in abstention and its actual\nabstention behavior, in order to evaluate whether our method\nhelps bridge the gap between cognitive awareness and absten-\ntion behavior. Specifically, at the intervention point identified\nby our method, we prompt the LRM to generate intermediate\noutputs both before and after the intervention. We then mea-\nsure two key indicators: the confidence when producing \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know\u201d responses, and the proportion of questions for\nwhich the model outputs \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. The results across\nall LRMs and datasets are shown in Table 6. The results are\nconsistent with those presented in Section 5.3 of the main\ntext. Our method consistently enhances the confidence in\ngenerating abstention responses. In addition, the abstention\nrate also shows corresponding improvements.\nFurther Analysis of Cognitive Monitoring.\nWe analyze\nthe cognitive monitoring component of our method and com-\npare our default monitoring strategy based on latent repre-\nsentations with alternative strategies relying on behavioral\nsignals. The behavioral signal approach monitors the LRMs\u2019\nintermediate outputs at the end of the paragraph generation\nphase (e.g., when it reaches a \u201cwait\u201d token), and uses these\noutputs to determine whether to trigger an intervention. We in-\nvestigate three variants: The \u201cdirect behavior\u201d strategy checks\nwhether the model\u2019s intermediate output is \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d\nand triggers an intervention immediately if so.

It plays a crucial\nrole in data analytics in various fields such as finance, healthcare,\nscientific research, manufacturing and general business process\nmanagement. With a two-dimensional representation format, tabu-\nlar data makes it easy for users to manage structured information,\nenabling complex data analysis and insight extraction methods to\nbe built on it. Complex data analytics require efficient data query\nand retrieval. Structured Query Language (SQL) is the standard for\ninteracting with tables in relational databases. It allows users to\nperform operations like filtering, joining, and aggregating data with\nthe support of underlying relational algebra. However, SQL has sev-\neral disadvantages. First, it is not easily accessible to non-technical\nusers, requiring knowledge of specific syntax and query structures.\nSecond, SQL struggles to handle large datasets efficiently, especially\nwhen dealing with super-large tables that exceed database limita-\ntions. Complex partitioning and mapping are often required to sup-\nport SQL executions on partitioned or distributed tables [3, 10, 27].\nThird, SQL supports limited operations and cannot perform com-\nplex data analyses such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA),\nanomaly detection, or advanced pattern recognition.\nRecent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled\nthe approach of feeding the entire table into the LLM and generating\nanswers to natural language queries [17, 31]. However, this method\nencounters significant challenges due to the limited context length\nof LLMs. To address these context limitations, one solution for table\nquerying relies on compressing or truncating large tables to fit the\ncontext limits of the models [19]. These methods, however, often\nresult in incomplete analyses and performance degradation, espe-\ncially when working with complex datasets that contain thousands\nof columns and rows. Moreover, even with efforts to compress\ninput content or increase token limits, LLMs cannot effectively\nhandle large tables, as they exceed the models\u2019 maximum input\nsize [4, 5, 25].\nThere are efforts to use Text-to-SQL to address the problem, but\nmany early work [2] were not widely used due to the difficulty of\nunderstanding natural language [12]. As an alternative, researchers\nhave explored LLM-based methods [7, 8, 14, 22] by providing only\nthe table schema to the LLM. The model generates SQL queries\nthat can be executed on the database according to the schema. This\napproach significantly alleviates the token limitation problem and\nhas demonstrated good performance in recent studies. However, it\nstill inherits SQL\u2019s inherent disadvantages: inefficiency with large\narXiv:2508.18758v1  [cs.DB]  26 Aug 2025\n\nConference acronym \u2019XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY\nYipeng Zhang, Chen Wang, Yuzhe Zhang, and Jacky Jiang\ndatasets and inability to perform complex data analyses beyond\nbasic querying. Here we particularly consider those datasets whose\nschemas do not fit into the context window of LLMs. While some\nefforts have attempted to teach LLMs to generate code directly\nor use APIs to overcome these limitations, problems related to\nscalability, efficiency, and the integration of complex analytical\nfunctions remain as a challenge for large-scale databases [16]. While\nsome efforts have attempted to teach LLMs to generate code directly\nor use APIs to overcome these limitations, problems related to\nscalability, efficiency, and the integration of complex analytical\nfunctions remain as a challenge for large-scale databases [16].\nTo address the problems, we propose a novel approach that\nleverages the advantages of SQL while overcoming its limitations.\nInstead of converting natural language to SQL queries, we directly\nconvert text-based queries to query plans corresponding to SQL-like\nqueries of the text. This provides flexibility to handle large data\nstored in the form of spreadsheets or CSV form, while remaining\ncompatible with traditional relational databases. We create a set of\nSQL-like operators, such as selection by conditions, ordering, union,\nand joining, but implemented outside the constraints of traditional\ndatabases. These operators allow us to mimic SQL functionality\nwithout being hindered by database limitations or inefficiencies\nwith large datasets, thus addressing the second disadvantage. An-\nother benefit of generating query plan directly is that operators are\nextensible and complex analytical functions required for specific\ntasks, such as dimension reduction, clustering, anomaly detection,\nand advanced pattern recognition can be easily integrated. This\nflexibility enables us to perform sophisticated data analyses directly\nwithin our framework, effectively solving the third disadvantage.\nAt the core of our approach is the problem of transforming a\nuser\u2019s natural language query into a sequence of operations that re-\ntrieves and processes the relevant data from tabular datasets before\nreturning the final answers to the user query. However, determining\nthe optimal sequence of operations is a computationally challenging\ntask. This problem is analogous to the classical NP-hard planning\nproblem. The complexity arises from the vast number of possible\noperation sequences and the dependencies between operations.\nTherefore, it is impractical to exhaustively search for the optimal\nsequence in polynomial time.\nTo overcome this challenge, we employ an iterative approach that\nincrementally constructs the operation sequence based on the ReAct\nprompting framework [28]. By utilizing LLMs, we can understand\nthe user\u2019s question and reason about the most appropriate next\nsteps based on the current state of the data. LLMs are well-suited for\nthis task due to their capabilities in natural language understanding\nand in-context learning [6, 9]. At each iteration, the model selects\nthe next operation to apply, and the process continues until the\nfinal answer is obtained. In addition, we provide a multi-level table\ndescription generation mechanism to scale our method to handle\nlarge data tables with thousands of columns.\nWe validate our approach through experiments on both tradi-\ntional databases, Spider dataset [29]), and large scientific tables,\nagronomic dataset [21]. The experiments on the Spider dataset\ndemonstrate that our solution performs well on traditional tab-\nular data in Table QA tasks, even without utilizing any training\ndata from the dataset, whereas the experiments on the agronomic\ndataset show that our solution is capable of handling super large\ntabular data under complex Table QA tasks.\n2\nRELATED WORK\nSupporting question-answering on tabular data has drawn increased\nattention as LLMs become increasingly powerful. Existing approaches\ncan be broadly categorized into two categories: semantic parsing-\nbased methods, and non-SQL-based question answering method-\nologies on structured data.\n2.1\nSemantic Parsing-Based Methods\nSemantic parsing uses LLMs to transform natural language ques-\ntions SQLs, and then run SQLs on data tables. Early solutions use\nencoder-decoder architectures to learn schema linking patterns [26].\nWith the advent of LLMs, the accuracy of generating SQL has dra-\nmatically improved. These models have been continuously breaking\nrecords on benchmarks like Spider [29].\nStudies [14, 15, 23, 24, 30] focus on tuning or enhancing language\nmodels to improve performance in text-to-SQL tasks. Specifically, Li\net al. [15] integrate graph-aware layers with a pre-trained T5 model\nto handle complex and multi-hop SQL queries, enhancing domain\ngeneralization. Li et al. [14] introduce a ranking-enhanced encoding\nand skeleton-aware decoding framework within a seq2seq model,\nsimplifying schema linking and enhancing SQL parsing. Qi et al.\n[23] augment a Transformer seq2seq architecture with relation-\naware self-attention, improving the model\u2019s capability to manage\nrelational data effectively in text-to-SQL translations. Scholak et al.\n[24] introduce incremental parsing techniques to constrain the de-\ncoding process of auto-regressive models, ensuring the generation\nof valid SQL by rejecting inadmissible tokens. Zeng et al. [30] pro-\npose a heuristic schema linking algorithm combined with a query\nplan model to rerank model-generated SQL queries.\nDespite these advancements, semantic parsing-based methods\ninherit SQL\u2019s inherent limitations. SQL struggles with large tables\ndue to database systems\u2019 constraints on the number of columns and\ninefficiencies when handling massive datasets. Additionally, SQL\nlacks support for complex data analyses beyond basic querying.\n2.2\nNon-SQL approach on structured data\nThere are many methods leveraging LLMs without relying on SQL\nfor tabular data question answering. A naive approach is to feed the\nentire tabular data as a context directly into an LLM to answer user\nqueries. The performance of this approach subjects to the context\nlength limitation in LLMs. Many existing LLM-based solutions for\ntable querying rely on compressing or truncating large tables to fit\nthe context limits of models. These methods not only reduce the\navailable data but also lead to incomplete analyses and performance\ndegradation, especially when working with tables containing thou-\nsands of columns and rows [19]. Even worse, studies show that\nwhen dealing with large tabular data, the performance drops more\nthan when handling normal textural content [4, 5, 25].\nOther methods in this category include the use of code inter-\npreters and the integration of LLMs with tools based on the ReAct\nframework [28].\n2.2.1\nCode Interpreter Methods. Code interpreter methods enhance\nthe coding abilities of LLMs to generate and execute code for data\n\nText to Query Plans for Question Answering on Large Tables\nConference acronym \u2019XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY\nmanipulation tasks. Notable works in this area include: SheetCopi-\nlot [13] proposes an agent that interprets natural language tasks\nand controls spreadsheets using a set of atomic actions based on\nVBA, enabling LLMs to interact robustly with spreadsheet software.\nXue et al. [18] introduces a framework where users provide task\ninstructions, and the system generates multiple candidate code\nsnippets, ranks them, and selects the best one to solve the task, it-\neratively refining the code for unsolvable rows. Binder [5] presents\na neural-symbolic framework that maps task inputs to programs\ncombining SQL and LLM functionalities, using GPT-3 Codex for\nparsing and execution without task-specific training.\nDirect code-generation is powerful and flexible for querying\ntabular data, but also suffers from uncertainty of generation with-\nout constraints. Troubleshooting is also difficult when results are\nunexpected.\n2.2.2\nReAct with Tools Methods. The ReAct [28] framework in-\ntegrates LLMs with predefined tools to enhance accessibility and\ninterpretability. Each operation can be easily understood by users,\nfacilitating transparency in the data manipulation process. Struct-\nGPT [11] proposes an iterative reading-then-reasoning framework\nwhere LLMs utilize interfaces to interact with structured data, such\nas databases and knowledge graphs. For tables, it supports basic\noperations like extracting column names and sub-tables. While\nusing tools and focusing on QA tabular data, it only processes\nsingle tables and offers a limited set of functions, restricting its\nability to perform complex data manipulations or analyses across\nmultiple tables. TableLLM [32] mainly focuses on enabling LLMs\nto manipulate tabular data embedded in documents and spread-\nsheets. It extracts tables and executes operations based on user\ninstructions, primarily handling tasks like data filtering and chart\ngeneration. ReAcTable [33] is built upon the ReAct model and gen-\nerates intermediate data representations to transform data into a\nmore accessible format for answering questions. However, it relies\non executing SQL and Python code, inheriting the disadvantages\nof both, including inefficiency with large datasets and potential\nsecurity risks associated with code execution.\nNone of these methods focus on large tables that are commonly\nused in scientific research.\n3\nMETHDOLOGY\nIn this section, we begin by defining the problem of transforming a\nuser\u2019s natural language query into a sequence of operations over\ntabular data. Due to the NP-hardness of finding an optimal solution,\nwe propose a solution to solving complex Table QA tasks through a\ncombination of large language models (LLMs) and a tree-structured\nplanning framework, where raw tables serve as leaf nodes, inter-\nmediate results form internal nodes, and the final result is the root.\nWe further introduce a three-level vector index system to facilitate\nefficient retrieval of columns among large tables.\n3.1\nProblem Definition\nTable QA tasks often require operations such as projection, sorting,\ngrouping, aggregation, and joining across multiple tables. Deter-\nmining the optimal sequence of operations to answer a user\u2019s query\nis computationally infeasible due to the NP-hardness of the prob-\nlem, as we prove later. To overcome the limitations of traditional\nFigure 1: The Example of Tree Structure Planning\nmethods, we formulate the problem as finding the correct sequence\nof operations that, when applied to the datasets, yields the desired\nresult according to the user\u2019s query.\nDefinition 1 (Problem Definition). Given a set of tabular\ndata D = {\ud835\udc511,\ud835\udc512, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5a}, a user query \ud835\udc5e, and a set of operators on D\ndenoted by O = {\ud835\udc5c1,\ud835\udc5c2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b}, our objective is to generate a logical\nplan \ud835\udc5d\u2208\ud835\udc43with O\ud835\udc56\u2286O so that \ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc5e, D) yields a result that satisfies\n\ud835\udc5e. Assuming the true answer to \ud835\udc5eis \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5e, our objective is as below:\nmin\n\ud835\udc5d\u2208\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc5e, D), \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5e)\n(1)\nwhere each table contains columns \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56.\ud835\udc36, each \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56is a fundamen-\ntal operation (e.g., selection, projection, joining, aggregation, and\nadvanced analytical functions); \ud835\udc43is all possible combinations of\noperators; A function \ud835\udc53(D,\ud835\udc5e, O) produces \ud835\udc5d; \ud835\udc46(D) denotes the\napplication of the sequence \ud835\udc46to the datasets D, resulting in the pro-\ncessed data; \ud835\udc3fis a loss function that quantifies how well the result\nsatisfies the user\u2019s query. For instance, it could be defined based\non the logical correctness of \ud835\udc5dto answer \ud835\udc5eon D or the distance\nbetween the answer produced by \ud835\udc5dand the true answer.\n3.2\nHardness of the Problem\nTheorem 1. Finding the optimal sequence of operations is an\nNP-hard problem.\nDetermining the optimal sequence\ud835\udc5dthat minimize \ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc5e, D), \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5e)\nis computationally challenging. This problem is analogous to the\nclassical planning problem in artificial intelligence, which is known\nto be NP-hard due to the combinatorial explosion of possible opera-\ntion sequences and dependencies between operations. The proof is\nshown in Appendix A.1. Therefore, it is impractical to exhaustively\nsearch for the optimal sequence in polynomial time.\n3.3\nTree Structure Representation\nTo effectively address the complexity of Table QA tasks, we propose\na tree-structured plan that represents the sequence of operations\nas a computational graph.

More importantly, research [1, 20]\nhas demonstrated that the tree-structured plan and the sequence\nof operations can be transformed into one another without loss of\ninformation or functionality. This bidirectional transformation is\nthe foundation of our solution, as it ensures that a feasible tree-\nstructured plan is the solution of our problem.\nOur tree-structured plan consists of the following components:\n\u2022 Leaves (Initial Tables): The independent tabular datasets \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\u2208\nD are represented as the leaf nodes of the tree. Each leaf node\ncorresponds to a raw dataset serving as input to the process.\n\u2022 Intermediate Nodes (intermediate results): Each intermedi-\nate node represents an intermediate result, which executes an\noperation \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56\u2208O on one or more child nodes (initial tables or\nintermediate results) to produce a new parent node.\n\u2022 Root Node (Final Result): The root node represents the final an-\nswer to the user\u2019s query, obtained after performing all necessary\noperations on the data.\nFigure 1 illustrates how our system leverages tree-structure plan-\nning to progressively generate the final result through a sequence\nof operations on tabular data. Both plans aim to answer the query:\n\"Which countries in Europe have at least 3 car manufacturers?\"\nThis question is from the Spider Dataset [29], and the SQL is the\nground truth of this query. This question involves three tables,\nCONTINENTS, COUNTRIES, and CAR_MAKERS, which are also\nthe leaves in our Tree structure solution.\nThe SQL-based plan begins by joining the COUNTRIES and\nCONTINENTS tables using the \u2018Continent\u2019 and \u2018ContId\u2019 fields to\ncombine country and continent information. It then joins this result\nwith the CAR_MAKERS table on the \u2018Country\u2019 field, adding car\nmanufacturer details such as \u2018ID\u2019, \u2018Maker\u2019, and \u2018FullName\u2019. After\nfiltering to include only countries in Europe, the data is grouped\nby \u2018CountryName\u2019, counting the number of car manufacturers per\ncountry. The system filters the groups to keep only those with at\nleast 3 manufacturers and finally selects the \u2018CountryName\u2019 column\nto produce the list of countries in Europe with three or more car\nmanufacturers.\nOur plan executs in a more efficient way by filtering countries by\ncontinent earlier in the execution. After joining the COUNTRIES\nand CONTINENTS tables to create Inter Table 1 with combined\ncountry and continent data, we immediately filter this interme-\ndiate table to retain only European countries (Continent = \u2019Eu-\nrope\u2019). This early filtering reduces the dataset before the join with\nCAR_MAKERS, resulting in a smaller Inter Table 3 that includes\nonly relevant data for European countries. Following this join, the\nremaining steps in our plan are similar to those in the SQL execution\nplan: we group Inter Table 3 by CountryID, count the number of\ncar manufacturers per country to get Inter Table 4. Finally, we filter\nto keep only those with at least three manufacturers, and extract\nCountryName into Final Table. This optimized approach minimizes\nintermediate data size and avoids unnecessary operations, making\nthe execution more efficient.\nThis process demonstrates the iterative nature of tree-structure\nplanning, where operations are sequentially applied, and the LLM\nevaluates intermediate results to decide the next step, discarding\nText queries\nReAct Logical\nPlanning\nOperators\nQuery Plans\n(Next Action)\nAction\nExecutor\nTable\nDescription\nGenerator\nColumn\nembeddings\nObservation\nAction\nTabular Data\nColumn name\nclustering, cluster and\ntable summaries\nCluster\nembeddings\nThree-level\nvector retrieval\nLarge Tables\nTable-Colum\nRetriever\nFigure 2: The Architecture of Tree-Driven Sequential Opera-\ntion QA System (TSO)\nirrelevant data when necessary to refine the path toward the final\nresult. Overall, the tree-structured plan offers four advantages:\nLearning Relational Tasks. Constructing the tree involves discov-\nering and applying appropriate relational operations that integrate\nvarious data sources to derive the final result. It effectively captures\nthe relational reasoning required in complex Table QA tasks.\nSequential Generation of the Computational Graph. The tree struc-\nture can be linearized, generating the computational graph sequen-\ntially from the leaves to the root. This linearization enables us to\nprocess operations step by step, applying one operation at a time\nand progressively building towards the final result.\nFeasibility with Large Language Models. By linearizing the pro-\ncess, we make it manageable for LLMs to handle. The LLM can\nfocus on selecting and applying one operation at a time rather than\ngenerating the entire operation sequence in one step, which would\nbe impractical due to computational constraints. (might combine\nwith the previous one)\nAbility to Backtrace. By maintaining all intermediate nodes (ta-\nbles), we enable the framework to backtrack to previous operations\nif the LLM realizes that a certain path does not lead towards the\ndesired outcome. This enhances the robustness of the solution by\nallowing corrections and adjustments, as any node above the leaves\nrepresents the result of a sequence of operations applied thus far.\n3.4\nThe Architecture\nNow, we are ready to introduce our solution, a Tree-Driven Sequential\nOperation QA System (TSO) that seamlessly combines observing\nthe tree-structure state and reasoning the next operation. The ReAct\n(Reasoning and Acting) framework provides such an integration,\nallowing LLMs to not only interpret and reason user queries but\nalso to execute actions through predefined tools. By adopting the\nReAct framework, we can decompose complex queries into man-\nageable tasks, execute them efficiently, and iteratively refine the\nresults to satisfy the user\u2019s query. Figure 2 shows the overall system\nstructure. At the center of our system is a supervisor agent, an\nLLM responsible for interpreting user queries and orchestrating\nthe execution of tasks using available tools. The supervisor agent\noperates through an iterative loop comprising the following steps:\n\nText to Query Plans for Question Answering on Large Tables\nConference acronym \u2019XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY\n(1) Thought: The supervisor agent assesses the current state\nof the tree, including all existing intermediate nodes and\ntheir results. Using the tree structure, the agent determines\nwhich relational operations are required next to move closer\nto the final result. It identifies dependencies and potential\noperations based on the current intermediate results.\n(2) Action: The agent chooses the most appropriate operation\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56\u2208O to apply to one or more child nodes. When the agent\napplies an operation, it adds a new intermediate node to the\ntree. This operation combines data from the relevant child\nnodes (which could be initial tables or previous intermediate\nresults) to create a new parent node.\n(3) Observation: After performing the operation, the agent\nexamines the result, which is the new intermediate node, and\nevaluates whether it helps answer the user\u2019s query. The LLM\nobserves the current state by reviewing all tables and their\ndescriptions generated by the table description generator.\n(4) Backtracking: If the observation indicates that the current\npath is not leading towards the desired outcome, the agent\ncan backtrack by revisiting previous nodes and reconsidering\nalternative operations. The ability to backtrace leverages the\ntree\u2019s hierarchical structure, allowing the agent to navigate\nto different branches and explore alternative sequences of\noperations. This step is optional and is integrated with the\nAction step.\nAs the iterative loop progresses, each operation adds a new node\nto the tree, building the computational graph step-by-step from the\nleaves to the root.\nToolset Description. We have developed a comprehensive set of\ntools within the ReAct framework to perform various data manipu-\nlation and analysis tasks. These tools are designed to handle large\ndatasets and can be easily extended to include new functionalities.\nThe key tools in our system include:\n\u2022 Data Loading Tool: Reads tabular files (e.g., CSV, Excel) into a\nDataFrame for processing.\n\u2022 Data Sampling Tool: Retrieves sample rows from a DataFrame to\nprovide an overview of the data.\n\u2022 Aggregation Tool: Performs aggregation operations such as sum,\nmean, count, and max on selected columns.\n\u2022 Grouping Tool: Groups data by specified columns and optionally\norders the results based on other columns.\n\u2022 Dataframe Introduction Tool: Generates summaries of DataFrames,\nincluding column indices and descriptions.\n\u2022 Join Tool: Merges two DataFrames based on specified join types\nand columns.\n\u2022 Sorting Tool: Sorts data within a DataFrame according to specified\ncolumns and order.\n\u2022 Selection and Filtering Tool: Selects specific columns and filters\nrows based on given conditions.\n\u2022 Set Operations Tool: Executes set operations (e.g., union, intersec-\ntion) between two DataFrames.\n\u2022 Advanced Analysis Tools: Performs complex analyses such as Prin-\ncipal Component Analysis (PCA), anomaly detection, PythonRE-\nPLTool, and value prediction.\nAlgorithm 1 Build Vector Stores\n1: Initialization: D = {\ud835\udc511,\ud835\udc512, . . . ,\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5a}, l\ud835\udc36, l\ud835\udc3a, lD\n2: for all tables \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\u2208D do\n3:\nfor all columns \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58\u2208\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56.\ud835\udc36do\n4:\n\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58.Des \u2190LLM_Describe(\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58)\n5:\nl\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58\u2190Embed(\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58.Des)\n6:\nStore (col_id : \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58.id, l\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58,\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58.Des) in l\ud835\udc36\n7:\nCluster \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56.\ud835\udc36to obtain clusters {\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc56} based on l\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58\n8:\nfor all clusters \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc57in \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc56do\n9:\n\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc57.Des \u2190LLM_Describe({\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58.Des | \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58\u2208\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc57})\n10:\nl\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc57\u2190Embed(\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc57.Des)\n11:\nStore (cluster_id : \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc57.id, l\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc57.Des) in l\ud835\udc3a\n12:\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56.Des \u2190LLM_Describe({\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc57.Des | \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc57\u2208\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc56})\n13:\nl\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\u2190Embed(\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56.Des)\n14:\nStore (table_id : \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56.id, l\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56.Des) in lD\n15: Return: l\ud835\udc36, l\ud835\udc3a, lD\nThese tools are implemented in Python and can be easily ex-\ntended or modified to accommodate additional functions, enhancing\nthe system\u2019s adaptability to various analytical needs.\n3.5\nLarge Tables Understanding\nIn large-scale scientific data analysis, researchers often deal with\ndatasets that have thousands of columns spread across multiple\ntables. This massive scale creates significant challenges when the\nReAct model is trying to understand all tables. Feeding the entire\ndataset or schema is impractical due to token limits. To handle\nthis, we create multi-level vector indexes for columns, clusters, and\ntables. By converting descriptions of these elements into vector\nformats (Algorithm 1), we can quickly compare the user\u2019s query\nwith the data components (Algorithm 2). This helps us find and\nprovide only the necessary columns to the LLM, bypassing the\ncontext length issue while ensuring the system remains scalable\nand efficient.\nAlgorithm 1 constructs the vector stores necessary for efficient\nquery processing by embedding the semantic descriptions of columns,\nclusters, and tables in a hierarchical structure. The algorithm begins\nby iterating through each table \ud835\udc51in the database D. For each table,\nit processes its columns by iterating over each column \ud835\udc50(Lines\n3\u20134). A human-readable description of each column is generated\nusing an LLM, which captures the semantic meaning of the column\ndata. The column description is then embedded into a vector l\ud835\udc50\n(Line 5), enabling numerical similarity computations. The column\nembeddings and descriptions are stored in the vector store l\ud835\udc36using\ncolumn IDs as keys (Line 6).\nOnce the columns have been processed, the algorithm clusters\nthe columns based on their embeddings (Line 7). For each resulting\ncluster \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc57, the LLM summarizes the descriptions of the columns\nwithin the cluster to generate a cluster description (Lines 8\u20139). This\ncluster description is then embedded into a vector l\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc57(Line 10),\nand both the cluster embeddings and descriptions are stored in the\nvector store l\ud835\udc3ausing cluster IDs as keys (Line 11).\nAfter processing the clusters, the algorithm generates a descrip-\ntion for the entire table by summarizing the descriptions of the\nclusters within it (Lines 12\u201313). This table description is embedded\ninto a vector l\ud835\udc51, and the table embeddings and descriptions are\nstored in the vector store lD using table IDs as keys (Line 14).\n\nConference acronym \u2019XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY\nYipeng Zhang, Chen Wang, Yuzhe Zhang, and Jacky Jiang\nAlgorithm 2 Query Relevant Columns\n1: Initialization: \ud835\udc5e, l\ud835\udc36, l\ud835\udc3a, lD, \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc50, \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc59\n2: q \u2190Embed(\ud835\udc5e)\n3: for all tables \ud835\udc51with embeddings l\ud835\udc51do\n4:\n\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc51\u2190sim(q, l\ud835\udc51)\n5: T \u2190{\ud835\udc51| \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc51\u2265\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc61}\n6: for all tables \ud835\udc51\u2208T do\n7:\nif Validate(\ud835\udc5e, LLM_Describe(\ud835\udc51)) is relevant then\n8:\nfor all clusters \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc57in \ud835\udc51with embeddings l\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc57do\n9:\n\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc57\u2190sim(q, l\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc57)\n10:\nC \u2190{\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc57| \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc57\u2265\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc50}\n11:\nfor all clusters \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc57\u2208C do\n12:\nif Validate(\ud835\udc5e, LLM_Describe(\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc57)) is relevant then\n13:\n\ud835\udc36\u2217\u2190Validate(\ud835\udc5e, LLM_Describe(\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc57))\n14:\nif \ud835\udc36\u2217= yes then\n15:\n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\u2190\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\u222a\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc57.\ud835\udc36\n16:\nelse\n17:\nfor all columns \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58\u2208\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc57.\ud835\udc36with embeddings l\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58do\n18:\n\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc58\u2190sim(q, l\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58)\n19:\n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51\u2190{\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58| \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc58\u2265\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc59}\n20:\nfor all columns \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58\u2208\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51do\n21:\nif Validate(\ud835\udc5e, LLM_Describe(\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58)) is relevant then\n22:\n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\u2190\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\u222a{\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58}\n23: return \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\nFinally, in Line 15, the algorithm returns the vector stores l\ud835\udc36, l\ud835\udc3a,\nand lD, each containing embeddings and descriptions for columns,\nclusters, and tables. This hierarchical embedding structure allows\nfor efficient query processing by enabling similarity searches at\nmultiple levels (columns, clusters, and tables), ensuring scalability\nwhen dealing with large datasets.\nAlgorithm 2 retrieves the columns relevant to a user\u2019s ques-\ntion by leveraging the vector embeddings of tables, clusters, and\ncolumns, stored in hierarchical vector stores. The algorithm begins\nby embedding the user\u2019s natural language query \ud835\udc5einto a vector\nq using the embedding function (Line 2). The query embedding\nis then compared with the vector embeddings of all tables l\ud835\udc51in\nthe database to compute similarity scores \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc51(Lines 3\u20134). Tables\nwith similarity scores above a threshold \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc61are selected as candidate\ntables (Line 5). These tables are stored in T for further evaluation.\nFor each candidate table \ud835\udc51in T, the algorithm first validates\nwhether the table is relevant to the user\u2019s question by checking\nthe semantic description generated by the LLM (Line 7). If the\ntable is relevant, the algorithm proceeds by calculating similarity\nscores between the query embedding and the cluster embeddings l\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc57\nwithin the table. Clusters with similarity scores above a threshold\n\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc50are selected and stored in C (Lines 8-10).\nFrom Lines 12-15, the algorithm validates each selected cluster to\ndetermine if its semantic description aligns with the user\u2019s question.\nIf the entire cluster is relevant, the algorithm includes all columns\nfrom the cluster in the set of relevant columns \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59, otherwise, the\nalgorithm evaluates the relevance of individual columns within\nthe cluster by computing similarity scores between the query em-\nbedding and column embeddings l\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58(Lines 16\u201318). Columns with\nsimilarity scores above a threshold \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc59are considered as candidates\nand validated using their semantic descriptions (Lines 19\u201322). If\nvalidated, these columns are added to \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59.\nAfter processing all relevant clusters in all relevant tables, the\nalgorithm returns the set of relevant columns \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59(Line 23). This\nhierarchical process ensures that the most relevant columns are\nselected based on their similarity to the user\u2019s query and their\nalignment with the query\u2019s semantic intent.\n4\nEXPERIMENT\nIn this section, we provide experimental results on two practical\ndatasets, the Spider dataset [29] and the agronomic dataset [21]. The\nexperiments on the Spider dataset demonstrate that our solution\nperforms well on traditional tabular data in Table QA tasks, even\nwithout utilizing any training data from the dataset. Moreover, we\nwill discuss the deficiency of the Spider Data. The experiments on\nthe agronomic dataset show that our solution is capable of handling\nsuper large tabular data under complex Table QA tasks.\n4.1\nDataset\nSpider [29] is a widely recognized benchmark dataset for Text-\nto-SQL tasks. It contains 8,659 instances in the training split and\n1,034 instances in the development split across 200 databases. Each\ninstance consists of a natural language question about a specific\ndatabase and its corresponding SQL query. In this paper, we use the\ndevelopment split (Spider-dev) only for evaluation purposes, as we\ndo not utilize the training data for model training. This approach\nallows us to assess the generalization ability of our solution without\nany fine-tuning of the training data.\nThe agronomic dataset [21] is a comprehensive dataset that con-\ntains results of the crop yield experiments from Australia. The\ndataset serves for a purpose of understanding crop growth and\ndevelopment under varying environmental and meteorological con-\nditions. The dataset collects trial results from 2008 to 2018. The\ndataset is structured around various data domains (DOMs), each\nproviding unique insights into different aspects of crop trials. The\ndataset captures time-series data, with many features recorded at\nmultiple time intervals relative to the planting date. In total, the\nagronomic dataset comprises 266,033 records and 8,058 features,\nmaking it a substantial resource for evaluating the scalability and\neffectiveness of our solution on large-scale, complex datasets. The\ndataset represents a typical trend of tabular data organisation in\nthe \u201cbig data\u201d era in scientific domains. For more details, please see\nAppendix A.2\n4.2\nExperiment Setting\nMetric. For the Spider dataset, since our solution outputs DataFrames\ninstead of SQL queries, we execute the ground truth SQL queries\nand compare their results with our DataFrames. We use the Exact\nMatch (EM) accuracy metric, which measures the proportion of\nqueries where our result exactly matches the ground truth. This\nmetric directly assesses the correctness of the data retrieved, re-\ngardless of how the query is written. We report EM accuracy across\ndifferent query hardness levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Extra\nHard) as defined in the Spider dataset.\nFor the agronomic dataset, because it doesn\u2019t have predefined\nquestions, we designed 20 queries: 10 easy, 5 medium, and 5 hard.\nThe easy queries involve straightforward operations like selection\n\nText to Query Plans for Question Answering on Large Tables\nConference acronym \u2019XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY\nand ordering; medium queries require multi-step operations involv-\ning multiple columns; hard queries involve complex operations\nlike principal component analysis (PCA) or anomaly detection. We\nmanually obtained the ground truth answers using standard data\nprocessing tools and compared them with our solution\u2019s outputs.\nWe report EM accuracy for each difficulty level to assess our solu-\ntion\u2019s performance across varying query complexities.\nBaselines. For the Spider dataset, we compare our method TSOwith\nDIN-SQL [22], as only this work provides the per-hardness EM\naccuracy metrics, and it ranks third on the Spider Execution with\nValues leaderboard, only 1.501% behind the top method. DIN-SQL\nprovides per-hardness EM accuracy metrics, making it a strong\nbenchmark for our evaluation. For the agronomic dataset, since\nthere are no existing baselines for our specific task, we focus on\nevaluating our solution\u2019s performance on the designed queries and\ndiscuss its effectiveness in handling complex, real-world data.\n4.3\nScientific Tabular Data\nWe conducted experiments on the agronomic dataset using 20 care-\nfully designed questions of varying difficulty levels\u201410 easy, 5\nmedium, and 5 hard\u2014to evaluate the effectiveness of our solution.\nFor the prediction task, we consider a prediction \"correct\" if its\npercentage error is within 10%. The percentage error is calculated\nas\n1\n\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5e|\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc5e, D) \u2212\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5e| \u2217100%. Our method correctly answers 16 out\nof 20 queries. Due to space limitations, we only show four of the\nquestions where our solution did not provide the correct answer\nto show the limitations of our approach. Noting that, the column\nsize exceeds many existing work\u2019s processing capability. For the\nfull list, please refer to Appendix A.3 and Table 2.\nQuestion 7: List the different crop rotations recorded one\nyear before planting. This question is to retrieve the column\nMETADom_Crop_rotation_minus_1_sub_cropWheat, which indi-\ncates the presence of wheat in the crop rotation one year before\nplanting. However, the generated description for this column was\nmisleading to the Table-Column Retriever. The description stated:\n\"This column indicates the presence of wheat within the crop rota-\ntion system one day before planting (day -1).\" The misinterpretation\nis because the description suggested a time frame of one day be-\nfore planting, whereas the column represents one year prior. This\ndiscrepancy led the Table-Column Retriever to incorrectly assess\nthe relevance of the column to the user\u2019s query, resulting in an\nincorrect answer.\nQuestion 15: How does cumulative evapotranspiration over\nthe first 80 days after planting relate to grain yield? This ques-\ntion is to relative to column PHENDom_X1000.grain.weight_2, 3,\nand 6. However, the question was ambiguous, leading the language\nmodel to return only the first relevant column, PHENDom_X1000.grain.weight_2,\ninstead of all three. This indicates a limitation in handling ambigu-\nous queries and suggests that providing more explicit instructions\nor incorporating clarification steps could improve the results.\nQuestions 19: For trials with high waterlogging, assess whether\nsoil properties contribute to the condition; Question 20: Use\nmachine learning to predict the breeder based on phenotypic\nand environmental data. The two questions are complex analyti-\ncal tasks that likely involve advanced computations or multi-step\nTable 1: Experimental Results on the Spider Dataset.

During the search for the answers, the supervi-\nsor agent decided to utilize the PythonREPLTool to execute Python\ncode to solve the problems. However, the agent became trapped in\ndebugging code errors and was unable to find a solution within the\nmaximum iteration limit.\nDespite these challenges, the overall performance indicates that,\nwith the proper tools, our solution effectively interprets and pro-\ncesses user queries over large tabular datasets. Future work may\nfocus on improving ambiguity resolution, enhancing description\naccuracy, and developing more robust code generation techniques\nto further increase the system\u2019s capabilities.\n4.4\nSpider Dataset\nWe evaluated our solution on the Spider dataset to assess its per-\nformance in interpreting natural language queries over complex\ndatabases. The results are shown in Table 1. Our solution has two\nversions: TSO and TSO\u2212. The difference is that TSO has access to\nthe database schema, while TSO\u2212does not. We have the following\nobservations:\nOur solution TSO achieved the second-best overall score, per-\nforming well across all difficulty levels. Notably, TSO got the best\nresults in the Easy and Extra Hard categories, showing its effec-\ntiveness in handling both simple and complex queries. In contrast,\nTSO\u2212performed worse than TSO. This shows the importance of\nproviding the schema to the solution. Knowing the schema helps\nthe system accurately map user queries to the relevant tables and\ncolumns, especially in complex databases with many tables.\nThe result shows that GPT models perform better in handling\ncomplex Table QA tasks. This trend matches the Spider leaderboard,\nwhere GPT-4-based solutions are among the top performers. The\nadvanced reasoning and language understanding of GPT models\nhelp our solution perform well across various query difficulties.\nDiscussion on Spider Dataset. We found that some discrepancies\nwere not due to errors in our solution but were caused by issues\nwithin the ground truth itself. From the six distinct types of errors\nincluding inconsistencies in query formulation, improper handling\nof NULL values, unjustified semantic inferences, misinterpretations\nof domain-specific terminology, data type mismatches, and ambi-\nguities in query interpretation, we illustrate how these issues can\nsignificantly impact the accuracy and reliability of QA systems.\nThese errors not only affected the evaluation of our solution\u2019s per-\nformance but also underscored how such issues can substantially\ninfluence the outcomes of QA models.\n\nConference acronym \u2019XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY\nYipeng Zhang, Chen Wang, Yuzhe Zhang, and Jacky Jiang\n1. Inconsistent Use of the DISTINCT Clause. Question 1: \"Find the\nfirst name and age of students who have a pet.\"\nSELECT DISTINCT T1 . fname ,\nT1 . age FROM student AS T1\nJOIN\nhas_pet AS T2 ON T1 . s t u i d = T2 . s t u i d ;\nQuestion 2: \"List all singer names in concerts in year 2014.\"\nSELECT T2 . name FROM s i n g e r _ i n _ c o n c e r t AS T1\nJOIN\ns i n g e r AS T2 ON T1 . s i n g e r _ i d = T2 . s i n g e r _ i d\nJOIN\nconcert AS T3 ON T1 . c o n c e r t _ i d = T3 . c o n c e r t _ i d\nWHERE T3 . year = 2 0 1 4;\nDiscussion. The ground truth SQL queries display an inconsis-\ntency in handling duplicate results due to the selective use of\nthe DISTINCT clause. While the first query removes duplicates\nto present unique combinations of student names and ages, the\nsecond query does not eliminate duplicates of singer names. This\ninconsistency can lead to unreliable evaluations of QA models, as\nthe presence or absence of duplicates affects the correctness of the\noutput. For consistent and accurate results, similar queries should\nuniformly apply the DISTINCT clause when duplicates are possible.\n2. Improper Treatment of NULL Values in Calculations. Question:\n\"For each zip code, what is the average mean temperature for all\ndates that start with \u20198\u2019?\"\nSELECT zip_code\n,\navg ( mean_temperature_f ) FROM weather\nWHERE date\nLIKE\n\" 8/ %\" GROUP BY zip_code\nDiscussion. The ground truth SQL may incorrectly compute the\naverage temperature by misinterpreting NULL values as zeros. In\ndata science and SQL standards, NULL values should be excluded\nfrom aggregate functions like AVG(). Treating NULL as zero intro-\nduces bias and leads to inaccurate results. The error highlights the\nneed for careful handling of missing data to ensure the validity of\nstatistical computations in SQL queries.\n3. Assumptive Semantic Substitution. Question: \"Show the medicine\nnames and trade names that cannot interact with the enzyme with\nproduct \u2019Heme\u2019.\"\nSELECT name ,\ntrade_name FROM medicine EXCEPT\nSELECT T1 . name ,\nT1 . trade_name FROM medicine AS T1\nJOIN\nm e d i c i n e _ i n t e r a c t i o n AS T2 ON T2 . medicine_id = T1 . id\nJOIN enzyme AS T3 ON T3 . id = T2 . enzyme_id\nWHERE T3 . product =\n' Protoporphyrinogen IX ' ;\nDiscussion. The ground truth query makes an unwarranted infer-\nence by replacing the user-provided term \u2019Heme\u2019 with \u2019Protopor-\nphyrinogen IX\u2019. This substitution is not justified within the given\ncontext and disregards the user\u2019s explicit input. Such semantic\nassumptions can lead to incorrect query results and misinterpreta-\ntion of the user\u2019s intent. Accurate SQL generation should adhere\nstrictly to the user\u2019s specified terms unless additional context or\nclarification is provided.\n4. Terminology Misalignment in Domain Concepts. Question: \"Find\nthe model of the car whose weight is below the average weight.\"\nSELECT T1 . model FROM CAR_NAMES AS T1\nJOIN CARS_DATA AS T2 ON T1 . MakeId = T2 . Id\nWHERE T2 . Weight < ( SELECT AVG( Weight ) FROM CARS_DATA) ;\nGround-Truth:\nModel\ntoyota\nplymouth\n. . .\nDiscussion. The ground truth SQL misinterprets the term \"model\"\nby returning car makes instead of models. In the automotive do-\nmain, the make is the manufacturer (e.g., Toyota), and the model is\nthe specific vehicle line (e.g., Camry). This misalignment leads to\nincorrect results that do not satisfy the user\u2019s query. Precise under-\nstanding of domain-specific terminology is crucial for generating\naccurate SQL queries that reflect the user\u2019s intent.\n5. Incorrect Data Type Handling in Numeric Comparisons. Ques-\ntion: \"What is the number of the cars with horsepower more than\n150?\"\nSELECT COUNT ( \u2217) FROM CARS_DATA\nWHERE horsepower > 1 5 0 ;\nDiscussion. The ground truth SQL fails to account for the data type\nof the horsepower column, which is stored as a string. Performing\nnumerical comparisons on string data can yield erroneous results\ndue to lexicographical ordering (e.g., \u2019200\u2019 is considered less than\n\u201980\u2019 because \u20192\u2019 comes before \u20198\u2019). To ensure accurate comparisons,\nthe query should cast the horsepower column to a numeric data type\nbefore applying the comparison operator. This oversight highlights\nthe importance of data type considerations in SQL queries involving\nnumerical operations.\n6. Ambiguous Reference to Entity Identifiers. Question: \"What are\nall the makers and models?\"\nSELECT Maker ,\nModel FROM MODEL_LIST ;\nGround-Truth:\nMaker\nModel\n1\namc\n2\naudi\n3\nbmw\n. . .\n. . .\nOur Result:\nMaker\nModel\namc\namc\nvolkswagen\naudi\nvolkswagen\nvolkswagen\n. . .\n. . .\nDiscussion. The ground truth SQL returns maker IDs instead of\nmaker names, which may not align with the user\u2019s expectation of\nobtaining human-readable information. In cases where identifiers\ncan represent multiple entities (e.g., IDs vs. names), it\u2019s important\nto clarify the user\u2019s intent or default to the more informative option.\nThis ambiguity can lead to outputs that are technically correct but\npractically unhelpful, affecting the user\u2019s ability to interpret the\nresults.\n7. Insufficient Handling of Tied Results in Aggregations. Question:\n\"Which year has the most number of concerts?\"\nSELECT YEAR FROM concert GROUP BY YEAR\nORDER BY COUNT ( \u2217)\nDESC LIMIT\n1 ;\nGround-Truth:\nYear\n2015\nOur Result:\nYear\ncount ( \u2217)\n2014\n3\n2015\n3\nDiscussion. The ground truth SQL does not account for the pos-\nsibility of ties when determining the year with the most concerts.\nBy applying LIMIT 1, it arbitrarily selects one of the years with\nthe highest count, potentially omitting other equally valid results.\nProperly handling ties in aggregate functions is essential to provide\na complete and accurate answer to the user\u2019s query. Adjusting the\n\nText to Query Plans for Question Answering on Large Tables\nConference acronym \u2019XX, June 03\u201305, 2018, Woodstock, NY\nquery to include all years with the maximum number of concerts\nensures that the output fully addresses the user\u2019s question.\n5\nCONCLUSION\nWe proposed the Tree-Driven Sequential Operation QA System\n(TSO), which transforms natural language queries into logical query\nplans on structured data without relying on SQL generation. By\nleveraging large language models (LLMs) to iteratively construct\nsequences of operations, TSO effectively handles queries of varying\ncomplexity. Our experiments on the Spider dataset and a large agro-\nnomic dataset with over 8,000 columns demonstrate TSO\u2019s ability\nto process extensive real-world tabular data that many existing\nQA systems cannot handle. Particularly, TSO successfully manages\nscientific data with thousands of columns, showcasing its scalability\nand flexibility. Our work offers a flexible and scalable solution for\nnatural language querying and analysis of large real-world tabular\ndatasets.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Alfred V. Aho, Ravi Sethi, and Jeffrey D.

We prove that our problem is NP-hard by reducing the\nClassical Planning Problem to our problem. In the Classical Plan-\nning Problem, given an initial state \ud835\udc600, a set of actions A, and a\ngoal state \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc54, the question is whether there exists a sequence of\nactions \ud835\udf0b= \u27e8\ud835\udc4e1,\ud835\udc4e2, . . . ,\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc58\u27e9, where \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56\u2208A, such that applying \ud835\udf0bto\n\ud835\udc600 results in \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc54. We construct an instance of our problem as follows.\nThe dataset D represents the initial state \ud835\udc600. Each action \ud835\udc4e\u2208A cor-\nresponds to an operation \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc4e\u2208O that transforms the dataset. The\nuser query \ud835\udc5especifies the goal state \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc54. If we can find a sequence of\noperations \ud835\udc5d= \u27e8\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc4e1,\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc4e2, . . . ,\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc58\u27e9that, when applied to D, results\nin a dataset corresponding to \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc54, then this sequence corresponds\nto a solution to the Classical Planning Problem. Therefore, solving\nour problem would solve the Classical Planning Problem. Since\nthe Classical Planning Problem is NP-complete, and we can reduce\nany instance of it to our problem in polynomial time, the decision\nproblem of our problem is NP-complete. Hence, the optimization\nversion of our problem is NP-hard.\n\u25a1\nA.2\nThe Agronomic Dataset\nThe agronomic dataset [21] is a comprehensive resource de-\nsigned to monitor and analyze crop growth and development across\na range of environmental and meteorological conditions. The dataset\nis structured around various data domains (DOMs), each offering\nunique insights into different aspects of the crop trials. These in-\nclude meteorological data from the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM),\nsatellite-based spectral data, metadata on trials and field manage-\nment, phenological observations, and environmental variables. Each\ndomain contains columns with structured names that provide a\nhierarchical description of the variables. The dataset captures time-\nseries data, where many features are recorded at multiple time\nintervals relative to the planting date. In total, the dataset contains\n266033 records and 8058 features.\nDomains Overview: MANDom (Metadata Domain): The MAN-\nDom domain provides metadata related to the crop trials, including\ninformation about the trial series, operators, farm machinery, and\nbreeders.\nTrial Series: Columns like MANDom_Series_name followed\nby the series identifier (e.g., Durum, Early.Conventional, ITAdv-\nMainLEP) document the trial series names and types. Breeder In-\nformation: Columns such as MANDom_Breeder followed by the\nbreeder\u2019s name (e.g., Advanta.Seeds, Bayer.CropScience) track the\nentities responsible for breeding the varieties tested in the trials.\nOrientation: Columns like MANDom_Orientation_sub_cropNorth,\nMANDom_Orientation_sub_cropWest indicate the crop orientation\nfor each trial, providing insight into field setup. PHENDom (Phe-\nnological Domain): The PHENDom domain captures phenotypic\nobservations during crop growth. These include measurements of\nplant development stages, yield, and other crop characteristics.\nYield Measurements: Columns like PHENDom_yield_pct_\nof_average, PHENDom_yield_t_hatrack the crop yield either\nas a percentage of the average or in tons per hectare. Develop-\nment Stages: The PHENDom_Zadoks_score columns (e.g., PHEN-\nDom_Zadoks_score_obs_1, PHENDom_Zadoks_score_obs_2) record\nthe Zadoks score at various observations, representing the pheno-\nlogical stages of plant growth. Grain Quality: Columns like PHEN-\nDom_X1000.grain.weight_2, PHENDom_X1000.grain.weight_6 track\nimportant parameters such as grain weight across different mea-\nsurements. Disease and Stress Resistance: Columns like PHENDo\nm_Yellow_Leaf_Spot, PHENDom_Waterlogging, andPHENDom\n_Weed_score indicate the plant\u2019s resilience against environmen-\ntal stressors and disease. METADom (Metadata Domain for Field\nand Chemical Management): The METADom domain provides in-\nformation on crop and chemical rotations, soil tests, and fertilizer\napplications.\nCrop Rotations: Columns like METADom_Crop_rotation_minu\ns_5_sub_cropWheat and METADom_Crop_rotation_minus_4_su\nb_cropField. Pea records the sequence of crops grown in previous\nyears, offering insight into crop management practices. Soil Tests:\nColumns such as METADom_Soil_test_class_10cm_Colwell,M\nETADom_Soil_test_class_60cm_Bray report the results of soil\ntests, providing data on soil properties at different depths. Previous\nCrop: Fields like METADom_previous_crop_same_sub_cropTRUE\nindicate whether the same crop was planted in consecutive years,\npotentially influencing soil health and yield outcomes. ENVDom\n(Environmental Domain): The ENVDom domain contains environ-\nmental variables that could impact crop yield, such as damage from\npests, animals, or herbicides.\nDamage Assessment: Fields like ENVDom_Damage provide in-\nsight into environmental damage affecting crops during the grow-\ning season. BOMDom (Bureau of Meteorology Domain): The BOM-\nDom domain captures key meteorological data such as temperature\nand rainfall, tracked over time for each trial.\nTemperature: Columns like BOMDom_max_temperature_m\nean_.80throughBOMDom_max_temperature_mean_250 and\nBOMDom_min_temperature_mean_0 through BOMDom_min_t\nemperature_mean_250 provide time-series data of maximum and\nminimum temperatures for specific days relative to planting (e.g.,\n-80 days before planting to 250 days after). Rainfall: Similar to tem-\nperature, columns like BOMDom_rainfall_mean_0 through BOM-\nDom_rainfall_mean_250 track daily rainfall data. Other Meteorolog-\nical Variables: Columns such as BOMDom_solar_exposure_mean\nprovide information on sunlight exposure during the crop\u2019s growing\nseason. SatDom (Satellite Domain): The SatDom domain includes\nremote sensing data obtained from satellite observations, capturing\na variety of spectral bands and other atmospheric and vegetative\nproperties.\nSpectral Data: Columns like SatDom_blue_band_mean_80,\nSatDom_NIR_mean_70, SatDom_MIR_mean_60 represent re-\nflectance data in different spectral bands (e.g., blue, NIR, MIR), which\nare important for analyzing vegetation health. Vegetation Indices:\nColumns such as SatDom_NDVI_mean_80, SatDom_EVI_mean_60,\nSatDom_FPAR_mean_70 provide indices that track vegetation\ngreenness, photosynthetic activity, and leaf area. Temperature and\nEvapotranspiration: Fields like SatDom_LST_day_mean_80, Sat-\nDom_LST_night_mean_70 track land surface temperature during\nthe day and night, while columns like SatDom_EvapoTrans_mean_80\nmonitor water loss from crops and soil.

Use machine learning to predict the breeder based on phe-\nnotypic and environmental data.\nS\nEach of the aforementioned domains follows a consistent column-\nnaming convention, which includes a prefix that identifies the data\nsource or domain (e.g., MANDom, PHENDom, METADom, BOM-\nDom, SatDom), followed by a descriptor that provides information\non the specific variable being measured, and ending with a time\npoint suffix (for time-series data) that indicates the day relative\nto planting. This time suffix allows users to track how each vari-\nable changes over the crop\u2019s growing period. Additionally, certain\ndomains (such as MANDom and METADom) contain metadata\nthat does not vary over time but provides contextual information\nessential for interpreting the results of the trials.\nThis dataset is designed to facilitate the analysis of complex en-\nvironmental and phenotypic factors affecting crop development\nand can be used to model relationships between environmental\nconditions and crop performance over time. The combination of\nmeteorological, satellite, and phenotypic data makes the agronomic\ndataset a rich resource for agricultural researchers aiming to un-\nderstand and optimize crop yield under varying environmental\nconditions.\nA.3\nThe Full Questions for Agronomic Dataset\nTable 2 summarizes these questions along with their correspond-\ning difficulty levels and results. The outcomes are labelled as T\nfor correct answers, F for incorrect answers, and S for scenarios\nwhere the solution could not find an answer within the maximum\niteration limit.\nA.4\nLLM Models and Parameters.\nWe utilize several large language models (LLMs) in our experiments\nto evaluate the performance of our solution:\nLlama 3.1: We use the Llama 3.1 model with 70 billion param-\neters, denoted as Llama3.1:70-ins-q4. This model is known for\nits strong performance on various language understanding tasks\nand provides a solid baseline for comparison.\nGPT-4o-mini: This is a smaller version of the GPT-4o model,\nnamed gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18. It offers a balance between com-\nputational efficiency and performance, making it suitable for testing\nthe scalability of our solution.\nGPT-4o: We employ the full GPT-4o model, version gpt-4o-2024\n-05-13, which is a state-of-the-art language model with advanced\nreasoning capabilities. Its superior performance on complex tasks\nallows us to assess the upper bounds of our solution\u2019s effectiveness.\nIn our Table-Column Retriever, we set the thresholds \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc61= 0.75,\n\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc50= 0.75, and \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc59= 0.75, which are used to filter relevant tables,\nclusters, and columns based on similarity scores between the query\nembedding and the data embeddings.\nWe use the embedding model thenlper/gte-large to generate\nvector embeddings for text descriptions. This model facilitates the\nretrieval of relevant data elements in our three-level vector index\nby capturing the semantic meaning of the text.\n",
  "pdfs/2508.18748v1.pdf": "Chronological Passage Assembling in RAG framework for Temporal\nQuestion Answering\nByeongjeong Kim, Jeonghyun Park, Joonho Yang, Hwanhee Lee*\nDepartment of Artificial Intelligence, Chung-Ang University\n{michael97k, tom0365, plm3332, hwanheelee}@cau.ac.kr\nAbstract\nLong-context question answering over narra-\ntive tasks is challenging because correct an-\nswers often hinge on reconstructing a coherent\ntimeline of events while preserving contextual\nflow in a limited context window. Retrieval-\naugmented generation (RAG) indexing meth-\nods aim to address this challenge by selectively\nretrieving only necessary document segments.\nHowever, narrative texts possess unique char-\nacteristics that limit the effectiveness of these\nexisting approaches. Specifically, understand-\ning narrative texts requires more than isolated\nsegments, as the broader context and sequen-\ntial relationships between segments are crucial\nfor comprehension. To address these limita-\ntions, we propose ChronoRAG, a novel RAG\nframework specialized for narrative texts. This\napproach focuses on two essential aspects: re-\nfining dispersed document information into co-\nherent and structured passages, and preserving\nnarrative flow by explicitly capturing and main-\ntaining the temporal order among retrieved pas-\nsages. We empirically demonstrate the effec-\ntiveness of ChronoRAG through experiments\non the NarrativeQA dataset, showing substan-\ntial improvements in tasks requiring both fac-\ntual identification and comprehension of com-\nplex sequential relationships, underscoring that\nreasoning over temporal order is crucial in re-\nsolving narrative QA.\n1\nIntroduction\nLong-context question answering tasks, which re-\nquire the ability to utilize one or more long doc-\numents (Pang et al., 2022), present a significant\nchallenge in natural language processing. While\nmodern transformer-based Large Language Models\n(LLMs) have shown a remarkable ability to han-\ndle long contexts (Liu et al., 2025; Wang et al.,\n2024), they face fundamental limitations when con-\nfronted with extremely long-form text.

(a)\nFine-grained indexing returns six standalone sentences,\nleaving key clues detached. (b) Our chronological as-\nsembling retrieves passages that include their immedi-\nate chronological context, preserving the narrative flow.\nBoxes indicate the directly retrieved sentences.\nextensive documents for every query leads to ma-\njor computational inefficiency, and as the context\ngrows longer, the models\u2019 ability to accurately iden-\ntify and prioritize relevant information decreases,\nimpacting the reliability of their outputs.\nTo\naddress\nthese\nchallenges,\nRetrieval-\nAugmented Generation (RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020)\nhas become a standard approach, focusing on\nefficiently retrieving only relevant segments from\nlarge documents to integrate into the model\u2019s\ncontext window. This selective retrieval method\nhelps models leverage vast knowledge bases far\nbeyond their built-in context limits.\nHowever, a fundamental methodological gap ex-\nists in most RAG frameworks (Lewis et al., 2020;\nSarthi et al., 2024): they primarily treat documents\nas a collection of short, independently-retrieved\nsnippets of information. This methodology fun-\ndamentally conflicts with the sequential nature of\nlong-form narratives, such as those found in history,\nliterature, and film. Narrative texts are uniquely\ndefined by their structure; they can be extremely\narXiv:2508.18748v1  [cs.CL]  26 Aug 2025\n\nlong, their individual passages often fail to convey\nthe full story unless read in order, and grasping\nthe chronological and relational connections be-\ntween passages is essential for comprehension.\nTreating passages as isolated facts severs these crit-\nical links, fragmenting the narrative timeline.\nFigure 1 illustrates the mismatch between con-\nventional retrieval strategies and the characteristics\nof narrative data. A common approach, as shown\nin (a) of Figure 1, is to retrieve as many sentences\nas possible that are likely to match the query, often\nbased on textual similarity. To do so, documents\nare typically stored as isolated sentences. While\nsuch methods may successfully retrieve a sentence\ncontaining the correct answer, they often fail to pro-\nvide sufficient contextual cues. For instance, this\ncan create ambiguity, making it unclear whether\n\"London\" or \"Paris\" is the location relevant to the\nquestion, even if both are mentioned in the retrieved\nresults.\nTo address this issue, we introduce ChronoRAG,\na novel RAG-based approach that embodies an al-\nternative strategy grounded in the principle that\nsolving narrative-based problems fundamentally\nrequires recognizing the chronological order of\nevents. Instead of maximizing the number of re-\ntrieved sentences, our framework, as shown in (b)\nof Figure 1, retrieves fewer distinct informational\nunits but includes their surrounding context to\ndisambiguate meaning. This approach provides the\ncrucial contextual clues\u2014indicating that \"London\"\nis associated with a reunion while \"Paris\" pertains\nto a farewell\u2014that are essential for accurate ques-\ntion answering. ChronoRAG achieves this by clar-\nifying dispersed narrative content into structured\npassages and explicitly capturing the temporal rela-\ntionships between them, enabling the retrieval of a\ncoherent narrative flow rather than a collection of\nisolated facts.\nWe empirically validate our proposed approach\non the NarrativeQA (Ko\u02c7cisk`y et al., 2018) dataset.\nTo rigorously test temporal reasoning, we isolate a\nsubset of \"Time Questions\" that require understand-\ning event sequences. Our experiments show that\nour method achieves significant improvements in\nboth the complete dataset and the specialized Time\nQuestion set. Notably, these results are achieved\nusing lighter graph construction and retrieval mech-\nanisms than those found in existing summary and\ngraph-based methods, demonstrating enhanced per-\nformance in identifying individual facts and com-\nprehending complex relational structures.\n\u2022 We find that resolving narrative QA requires\nleveraging event chronology and preserving con-\ntextual flow, which guides our method in distill-\ning dispersed story elements into coherent, tem-\nporally aware passages.\n\u2022 We\nintroduce\na\nnovel\nRAG\nframework,\nChronoRAG, which refines raw text into struc-\ntured passages, explicitly maintains temporal\nlinks between events, and incorporates adjacent\ncontext.\n\u2022 Experiments on the NarrativeQA dataset demon-\nstrate the effectiveness of our framework, and\nemphasizing event-to-event relations drives per-\nformance gains for both factual and temporal\nqueries, highlighting the critical role of relational\nunderstanding over entity extraction.\n2\nRelated Work\nPassage Granularity.\nDocument indexing ap-\nproaches have been explored with varying pas-\nsage granularity to improve retrieval precision.\nDenseXRetrieval (Chen et al., 2024) advocates\nfiner granularities to enhance information precision.\nConversely, MolecularFacts (Gunjal and Durrett,\n2024) demonstrates that overly granular decompo-\nsitions such as atomic facts or propositions often\nlose critical contextual cues, advocating instead\nfor concise yet contextually coherent units. Our\nmethod employs atomic facts as keys for retrieval\nwhile preserving broader narrative flows as the re-\ntrieved values.\nSummary-Based\nDocument\nAugmentation.\nSummary-based indexing methods,\nincluding\nRAPTOR (Sarthi et al., 2024), MemWalker (Chen\net al., 2023), and ReadAgent (Lee et al., 2024)\nleverage iterative summarization to build hierar-\nchical structures that improve retrieval accuracy\nand contextual coherence. However, such methods\noften suffer from high computational costs due\nto deep hierarchical structures and redundant\noverlapping information. Our approach simplifies\nthe hierarchical concept by adopting a single-layer\nsummary,\nsignificantly reducing computation\nand overlap issues while maintaining contextual\neffectiveness.\nKnowledge Graph-Based Document Augmenta-\ntion. Graph-based augmentation methods, such as\nGraphRAG (Edge et al., 2024) and LightRAG (Guo\net al., 2024), typically construct knowledge graphs\nby extracting entities and relationships from docu-\nments. These methods are good at capturing entity-\n\ncentric information but struggle to represent re-\nlationships between entities explicitly, a crucial\nelement in narratives. Our proposed framework\nexplicitly incorporates sequential relations among\nnarrative elements, addressing this critical limita-\ntion of traditional knowledge graphs.\n3\nChronoRAG\nWe present ChronoRAG, a novel Retrieval-\nAugmented Generation (RAG) framework special-\nized for narrative texts where chronological context\nis crucial. As described in Figure 2, our frame-\nwork is composed of two primary stages: an offline\nGraph Construction phase where the original doc-\numents are processed into a hierarchical, linked\nstructure, and an online Passage Retrieval and\nAnswer Generation phase where the constructed\ngraph is used to answer queries.\n3.1\nGraph Construction\nThe goal of this offline phase is to transform a\nraw document into a structured, two-layer graph\nthat captures both factual information and narrative\nchronology. This process involves the following\nsteps:\nDocument Chunking. Due to inherent limitations\nin handling entire documents simultaneously, we\nfirst divide the original document into fixed-length\nchunks (e.g., 100 tokens each). These chunks con-\nstitute Layer 0 of our hierarchical graph, facilitating\nconsistent and manageable retrieval. While fixed-\nlength chunking may disrupt internal narrative co-\nherence, maintaining a consistent token length is\ncrucial for retrieval. Hence, we avoid semantic\nchunking with variable lengths.\nSummarizing Chunks. Next, we group chunks\n(e.g., 10 chunks per group) and summarize them by\ninstructing LLM. This summarization distills com-\nplex narrative passages, clarifying overall content\nand creating more manageable retrieval units.\nEntity-Relation Extraction. Then we instruct the\nLLM to extract entities from summarized texts and\ngenerate relational descriptions between entities.\nWe utilize only relation descriptions for indexing\nand retrieval, avoiding overlapping entity descrip-\ntions that might disrupt narrative flow. These re-\nlations, functioning like atomic facts, constitute\nLayer 1 in the hierarchical graph, enhancing re-\ntrieval precision due to their focused and coherent\ninformational structure.\nIndexing. We assign narrative-order indices to\nboth relation description sentences derived from\nsummaries and to original document chunks. Re-\nlation descriptions are indexed according to the\nposition of their source chunks in the document\nand the order in which the descriptions were gener-\nated, with lower indices assigned to those derived\nfrom earlier chunks or generated earlier in the pro-\ncess. Furthermore, each relation sentence stores the\nindex of the original chunk it was derived from as\na child index, enabling quick access to neighboring\nrelations and original chunks.\nNeighborhood Assembling.\nWe augment re-\ntrieved relational descriptions with their surround-\ning context to reconstruct a narrative flow. Rather\nthan relying on isolated facts, we aim to provide\ncontextually rich information.\nSpecifically, for\nLayer 1 retrievals, we separate the role of the re-\ntrieved item into a key (the relation description\nitself) and a value (neighboring Layer 1 passages\nconcatenated in index order). This approach allows\nus to preserve a coherent local storyline rather than\nreferencing fragmented facts.\n3.2\nRetrieving Passage\nAt inference time, a query is handled through a\nhierarchical retrieval process that leverages the con-\nstructed graph to assemble a rich, chronologically-\naware context for the LLM.\nHierarchical Retrieving. We leverage the hier-\narchical granularity of Layer 1 and Layer 0 for\nretrieval. We begin by retrieving high-precision\nrelation descriptions from Layer 1. Then, using the\nassociated child indices, we retrieve related Layer\n0 chunks, ensuring a comprehensive and balanced\ncontext. This is crucial because Layer 0 often re-\ntains omitted details and original dialogues that are\nvaluable for question answering.\nAnswer Generation. We combine the original\nquery with the context obtained through hierarchi-\ncal retrieval and feed them into the language model.\nEach passage is separated by double line breaks\nand ordered by relevance, enabling accurate and\ncoherent answer generation.\n4\nExperiments\n4.1\nExperimental Setup\nDataset. We employ the NarrativeQA (Ko\u02c7cisk`y\net al., 2018) as our primary dataset. NarrativeQA\ncomprises 355 stories and scripts with a total of\n10,557 question\u2013answer pairs. From this pool, we\nidentify and separate a subset of 1,111 Time Ques-\n\nDocument\nChunks\nOriginal\nDocument\nChunk\nSummaries\nRetrieve\nSimilar\nPassage\n     Graph Construction\n     Passage Retrieving & Answer Generation\nChunking \nSummarization\nEntity-Relation\nExtraction\nNeighborhood\nAssembling\nSource Chunk\nLinking\nfor Hierarchical Retrieving\nRelation\nDescription\nRelation\nDescription\nDocument\nChunks\nIndexing & Linking\nLayer 1\nLayer 0\nQuery: Who leads the fellowship after Gandalf dies? \nGandalf confronts the Balrog in Moria and refuses to let it pass (idx 38), \nGandalf orders Aragorn to lead the Fellowship of the Ring (idx 39), \nGandalf falls off a cliff with Balrog and disappears (idx 41)\nAnswer: Aragorn\nRetrieving from Layer 1\nAttach Neighborhood Context\nRetrieving from Linked Layer 0\nFigure 2: Overall Pipeline of ChronoRAG.\ntions, defined as those containing temporal key-\nwords {\u201cWhen,\u201d \u201cWhile,\u201d \u201cDuring,\u201d \u201cAfter,\u201d \u201cBe-\nfore\u201d}. These Time Questions require retrieving\nand reasoning over multiple related events, making\nthem a particularly challenging subset for temporal\nunderstanding and reasoning.\nEvaluation Metric. We measure answer quality\nusing ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004), which computes the\nLongest Common Subsequence overlap between\na generated answer and its corresponding human\nreference. Due to the short and pronoun-heavy\nnature of NarrativeQA answers, ROUGE-L effec-\ntively captures agreement in key word sequences\nwithout penalizing minor rephrasings.\nBaselines. We compare against five existing meth-\nods that differ in information extraction, represen-\ntation, and retrieval structure:\n\u2022 NaiveRAG: A standard RAG pipeline that per-\nforms chunk-level retrieval only, without further\nstructuring (Lewis et al., 2020).\n\u2022 RAPTOR: Clusters semantically similar chunks\nvia embedding similarity and builds a recur-\nsive summarization tree over clusters to guide\nretrieval\u2014CT (Collapsed Tree) flattens each\nroot-to-leaf path into one high-level summary,\nwhereas TT (Tree Traversal) retains the full hi-\nerarchy and drills down level-by-level to gather\nfiner-grained context (Sarthi et al., 2024).\n\u2022 LightRAG:\nConstructs\na\nlightweight\nen-\ntity\u2013relation graph to enable fast context retrieval\nusing dual-level extraction, prioritizing computa-\ntional efficiency and incremental updates (Guo\net al., 2024).\n\u2022 GraphRAG: Builds a richer graph with detailed\nrelation weighting and neighborhood assembly\nto support deeper multi-hop retrieval, capturing\nboth high-level relation summaries and their un-\nderlying chunks (Edge et al., 2024).\n\u2022 Propositionizer: Transforms the entire source\ntext into fine-grained propositions (atomic sen-\ntences) and treats each proposition as a retrieval\nunit, then feeds retrieved propositions into the\ngeneration model (Chen et al., 2024).\nImplementation Details. All baselines share iden-\ntical hyperparameter settings: top-k of 20 for\nretrieval, contextTokenLengthLimit of 1,500 to-\nkens, and the same sampling strategy during gen-\neration. We perform all summarization and en-\ntity\u2013relation extraction steps with meta-llama-3-\n8B-Instruct (Grattafiori et al., 2024).\nWe com-\npute retrieval scores using embedding similarity\nexclusively; we don\u2019t use BM25 (Robertson et al.,\n2009) to prevent distortion of the original text dur-\ning generation. Specifically, we employ the arctic-\nSnowflake-embed-l (Merrick et al., 2024) for gen-\nerating embeddings, and use unifiedqa-v2-t5-3b-\n1363200 (Khashabi et al., 2022) for final answer\ngeneration. All retrieved contexts fed into the gen-\nerator respect the 1,500-token length limit to ensure\nfair comparison across methods.\n4.2\nMain Results\nPerformance Comparison. Table 1 shows that\nChronoRAG, our proposed approach outperforms\non both the full NarrativeQA full dataset and the\nTime Question subset compared to baselines. Sum-\nmarization based baselines such as RAPTOR-CT\nand RAPTOR-TT follow, but they still lag. The\nresults indicate that restructuring events into a clear\n\ntemporal order supplies the language model with\nthe most coherent context for narrative reasoning\nand question answering. GraphRAG records the\nlowest score among all methods for several reasons.\nIts exhaustive entity\u2013relation extraction adds thou-\nsands of trivial nodes, inflating the graph and bury-\ning key plot elements under noise. And it omits the\ncovariate filtering stage, so graph expansion begins\nfrom noisy entity-relations and quickly drifts into\nirrelevant subgraphs. These compounded issues\ndilute precision so severely that GraphRAG scores\nlowest.\nMethod\nWhole Data\nTime Question\nNaiveRAG\n0.255\n0.227\nPropositionizer\n0.262\n0.238\nRAPTOR_CT\n0.297\n0.261\nRAPTOR_TT\n0.295\n0.259\nLightRAG\n0.240\n0.214\nGraphRAG\n0.200\n0.185\nCHRONORAG\n0.308\n0.268\nTable 1: QA Performance on NarrativeQA (ROUGE-L).\nTop performance is bolded, Second best is underlined.\nAblation Study.

The results without\npassage assembling are obtained by individually\nsearching for entity relations extracted from the\nsummary, while the results without chunk summa-\nrization are obtained by searching for entity rela-\ntions directly extracted from the 10 chunks.

Our experiments revealed that this trade-off\nhas a detrimental effect on retrieval quality. when\nthe number of adjacent sentences included in each\npassage was increased to two, overall and temporal\nquestions performance declined to 0.300 and 0.258,\nrespectively.\nComputation Costs. Our pipeline is computa-\ntionally efficient, requiring just two LLM calls per\n1,000 tokens for graph construction. Although this\ncost increases linearly with document length, it re-\nmains lower than competing methods like recursive\nsummarization. Furthermore, only one LLM call is\nrequired for answer generation during search, with\nour method still attaining the highest performance\ndespite its efficiency.\nCase Study.\nFigure 3 presents excerpts of the\noriginal passages retrieved by each method for the\nexample shown in Figure 1. RAPTOR retrieves\nsummary passages, which enables access to content\ncovering a wide range of information. However,\nthese summaries frequently include information\nthat is not pertinent to the query, or conversely,\nomit critical details necessary for answering the\nquestion due to length constraints imposed by the\nsummarization process. LightRAG and GraphRAG\nextract entities and relations directly from the orig-\ninal text. In particular, GraphRAG was found to\nunderperform compared to direct retrieval to the\nsource chunk, likely due to its tendency to include\nexhaustive explanations of all elements. Propo-\nsitionizer and LightRAG offer relatively general-\nlevel granularity explanations, yet they still strug-\ngle to address questions that require understanding\nthe changes in the relationship between Anna and\nGeorge. In contrast, ChronoRAG identifies the min-\nimal set of chronologically adjacent passages while\n\nsuppressing unrelated narrative details, illustrating\nits strength in maintaining temporal coherence and\nreducing retrieval noise.\n5\nConclusion\nWe present ChronoRAG, an RAG Framework that\ncan effectively and efficiently handle narrative text.\nOur framework refines content through summariza-\ntion and relation extraction, and improves overall\nperformance through simple passage augmentation\nthat connects adjacent events via an index. This\nsuggests that it is important not only to organize\nindividual events and elements in narrative texts\nbut also to connect events that are spatially and\ntemporally close to each other.\nAcknowledgement\nThis work was supported by the Institute of Infor-\nmation & Communications Technology Planning\n& Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korea gov-\nernment (MSIT) [RS-2021II211341, Artificial In-\ntelligence Graduate School Program (Chung-Ang\nUniversity)] and the Chung-Ang University Grad-\nuate Research Scholarship in 2023 and was im-\nproved by the helpful input and collaboration of\nresearchers from LG AI Research.\nReferences\nHoward Chen, Ramakanth Pasunuru, Jason Weston, and\nAsli Celikyilmaz. 2023.

For complex problems that demand slow, an-\nalytical System-2 thinking, they deploy Long CoTs\nenriched with self-reflection, back-tracking and\nbudget-forcing \u2014 an approach adopted by frontier\nsystems such as OpenAI\u2019s o1 (Jaech et al., 2024),\nDeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al., 2025) and the inference-\ntime scaling method s1 (Muennighoff et al., 2025a)\n\u2014 and one that has markedly improved performance\non challenging reasoning benchmarks.\nFrontier LLMs such as GPT o-series, Claude-3.7\nSonnet, and Gemini-2.5 Pro internalize long-chain\nreasoning techniques and dynamically adjust CoT\nlength, thereby achieving state-of-the-art results\non demanding benchmarks like AIME and GPQA\n(Jaech et al., 2024; Anthropic, 2025; Google, 2025).\nRecent open-source initiatives follow the same tra-\njectory: projects such as RedStar (Xu et al., 2025b)\n*Equal contribution\nFigure 1: Comparison of reasoning trace generation.\nMost studies (top) use standard LLMs to generate ver-\nbose, repetitive reasoning with excessive connector us-\nage.

Recent evaluations corroborate\nthis trade-off: Long-CoT-optimized models excel\non System-2 thinking benchmarks yet falter on in-\ntuitive, System-1 tasks (Zhang et al., 2025). These\nfindings underscore a pressing need for balanced\ndual-system reasoning in LLMs \u2014 models must\nlearn to invoke fast, heuristic reasoning for simple\nqueries while reserving slow, analytical reasoning\nfor genuinely hard problems.\nIn this paper, we propose Connector-Aware\nCompact Chain-of-Thoughts (CAC-CoT), a data-\ngeneration framework that bridges the gap between\nexhaustive System-2 reasoning and agile System-\n1 intuition. CAC-CoT prompts frontier LLMs to\nproduce reasoning traces that (i) insert explicit con-\nnector sentences \u2014 e.g., \u201cLet\u2019s pause and rethink\nthis.\u201d, \u201cHmm, that might be a dead end.\u201d \u2014 as\ndeliberate checkpoints for self-reflection, and (ii)\nenforce structural compactness that discourages\ngratuitous length. These connectors cue the model\nto pause, verify, or backtrack only when necessary,\npreventing runaway verbosity while preserving log-\nical coherence. In effect, it trains models to balance\ndual-system reasoning: they engage thorough an-\nalytical reasoning when warranted yet default to\nconcise, intuitive responses on simpler queries. The\nproposed method is outlined in Figure 1.\nTo build a high-quality CAC-CoT dataset, we\nleverage Gemini-2.0-Flash \u2014 a cost-efficient but\ncapable frontier model \u2014 using a simple single-\nturn prompt that elicits concise, connector-rich\ntraces. Despite the dataset\u2019s modest size and sim-\nplicity of the prompting strategy, fine-tuning target\nmodels on this data yields strong reasoning per-\nformance. The result is an exceptionally economi-\ncal training recipe that bypasses the need for large\nLong CoT corpora or complex pipelines.\nComprehensive experiments confirm CAC-\nCoT\u2019s effectiveness. On demanding System-2\nthinking benchmarks, our model attains \u224885%\non GSM8K and \u224840% on GPQA (Rein et al.,\n2024) with Long-CoT fine-tuned specialists. On\nS1-Bench (Zhang et al., 2025), which stresses in-\ntuitive System-1 thinking, Ours reaches \u224885 %,\nrepresenting an improvement of over 20% points\ncompared to the s1.1 and LIMO baselines.. Effi-\nciency follows suit: the model averages an ART\nof \u2248300, surpassing nearly all prior systems in\ncomputational economy. Collectively, these results\ndemonstrate that connector-based, compact reason-\ning traces are a promising foundation for future\nreasoning data sets and models.\n2\nRelated works\n2.1\nLong Chain-of-Thought\nRecent advancements in CoT prompting have sig-\nnificantly enhanced the reasoning abilities of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) by decomposing com-\nplex tasks into intermediate steps (Wei et al., 2022).\nEarly work mainly relied on static, human-written\nexemplars, but subsequent studies introduced self-\nreflection and backtracking mechanisms to gen-\nerate longer yet more adaptive reasoning traces.\nFor instance, Reflexion prompts an agent to store\nepisodic self-feedback between trials (Shinn et al.,\n2023), whereas Self-Refine iteratively rewrites its\nown output until self-criticism converges (Madaan\net al., 2023). Building on this idea, Pang et al.\n(2024) directly optimizes pairwise preferences be-\ntween good and bad traces, and Adarsh et al. (2024)\ndistills high-quality rationales into smaller models\nvia self-guided cycles of error detection and re-\ngeneration.\nIn other research directions on Long CoT, there\nis ongoing debate regarding the optimal length and\ngranularity of reasoning traces. (Yao et al., 2023a)\nargue that concise, structured traces improve effi-\nciency without harming accuracy, whereas (Shen\net al., 2025) present scaling laws showing that\nlonger reasoning often improves performance on\ndifficult tasks, particularly for large models. Recent\nobservations suggest that overly lengthy reasoning\ntraces can result in diminishing returns or even per-\nformance degradation due to noise accumulation\nand increased inference costs (Chen et al., 2025).\nThis phenomenon, often termed overthinking, dis-\nproportionately hampers smaller models, which\nstruggle to assimilate and faithfully reproduce the\nexcessively long reasoning chains that arise when\nthey are trained on Long CoT data (Li et al., 2025c;\nWu et al., 2025; Xu et al., 2025a; Zhang et al.,\n2025).\n2.2\nData Efficiency and Overthinking\nWhile architectural advances have driven recent\ngains in reasoning performance, growing evidence\nhighlights that the structure and quality of train-\ning data play an equally critical role (Li et al.,\n2025a; Swayamdipta et al., 2020). In particular,\nLong Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) supervision\n\nhas proven effective for inducing structured rea-\nsoning. However, such traces are often verbose,\nincreasing both training cost and the risk of overfit-\nting to unnecessary steps (Chen et al., 2025).\nRecent studies attempt to mitigate this verbosity\nby emphasizing logical sufficiency over exhaus-\ntiveness. For instance, Sky-T1 (Li et al., 2025a)\nenhances reasoning robustness by filtering out in-\ncorrect reasoning traces rather than compressing\nthem. Meanwhile, LIMO (Ye et al., 2025a) curates\nhigh-quality datasets and applies multi-step super-\nvision to highlight only the essential logical steps.\nAlthough neither approach directly targets brevity,\nboth demonstrate the potential to improve training\nefficiency by focusing on core reasoning content.\nThese strategies reflect a broader trend toward data-\ncentric LLM development, where the structure and\nquality of supervision play a decisive role in down-\nstream reasoning behavior.\nDespite improvements, overthinking remains a\nfailure mode. Models often produce overly detailed\nreasoning even for intuitive tasks, leading to re-\ndundancy, inconsistencies, and degraded perfor-\nmance\u2014particularly on System-1 benchmarks (Sui\net al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2025). This issue is pro-\nnounced in smaller models, where excessive elabo-\nration introduces noise or contradictions (Yao et al.,\n2023b; Chen et al., 2024). Even compact prompting\nstrategies can backfire when misapplied to simple\nproblems, underscoring the need for task-aware\nreasoning generation that adjusts explanation depth\nto problem complexity.\n2.3\nDual-System Reasoning\nDual-system theory distinguishes between two\ntypes of cognition: fast, intuitive System-1 rea-\nsoning, and slow, analytical System-2 reasoning\n(Kahneman, 2011; Kannengiesser and Gero, 2019).\nAlthough large reasoning models excel at complex\nSystem-2 tasks, their performance often deterio-\nrates on simpler System-1 tasks due to unneces-\nsarily elaborate reasoning strategies (Zhang et al.,\n2025). This highlights a critical limitation\u2014current\nmodels often lack the cognitive flexibility needed\nto generalize across varied reasoning demands.\nEarly attempts to address this limitation took di-\nvergent approaches. LIMO curated a minimal yet\nchallenging question set requiring detailed reason-\ning and manually verified each reasoning step for\nhigh-quality supervision. However, its scalability\nis limited by the labor-intensive nature of manual\nannotation. In contrast, Sky-T1 distilled reasoning\npatterns into fixed-length traces via offline analysis\nand trained LoRA adapters, sacrificing adaptability\nand stylistic diversity for inference simplicity.\nCAC-CoT adopts a different approach by re-\nmoving reliance on learned reasoning models\n(LRMs) during trace generation. Instead of imitat-\ning model-generated reasoning trajectories, CAC-\nCoT explicitly injects connector phrases into the\ngeneration process. This strategy leverages exist-\ning high-quality question datasets (such as those\nfrom LIMO) while guiding models to produce\nconcise, cognitively aligned reasoning traces. No-\ntably, CAC-CoT achieves this without requiring\nchain-level annotations or reinforcement learning,\nthereby promoting both training efficiency and\ndual-system adaptability. Its connector-driven ap-\nproach allows for controllable variation in reason-\ning form while maintaining semantic coherence,\noffering a scalable path toward more flexible and\ncognitively grounded reasoning systems.\n3\nMethodology\nBuilding on recent advances in reasoning models \u2014\nwhich demonstrate significant performance gains\nthrough mechanisms such as self-reflection, back-\ntracking, and self-correction \u2014 ours, CAC-CoT,\nadopts a structured approach that explicitly injects\ndiverse connector phrases into the training data. By\ndeliberately guiding the model\u2019s reasoning behav-\nior through these connectors and tightly controlling\nthe length of reasoning traces compared to conven-\ntional Long-CoT datasets, CAC-CoT enables the\nemergence of a robust dual-system reasoning capa-\nbility. This design allows the model to adaptively\nbalance concise, intuitive responses for System-1\ntasks with deeper, structured reasoning for System-\n2 challenges, thereby achieving strong and general-\nizable performance across both cognitive regimes.\nThe prompts and generation logic we used can be\nseen in Table 6 and Algorithm 1 of the Appendix,\nrespectively.\n3.1\nConnector-Aware CoT\nIn reasoning models, a variety of connectors (e.g.,\nWait, Hmm, Alternatively) are often used to facil-\nitate the flow of reasoning, particularly through\nmechanisms such as self-reflection and backtrack-\ning. Inspired by this observation, we propose a data\nconstruction method that explicitly injects connec-\ntors into the reasoning process. This encourages the\nmodel to maintain or even enhance its reasoning\n\nperformance by following a structured and reflec-\ntive approach. The key components of our method\nare as follows: (1) Insert checkpoints after each\nreasoning step for reassessment; (2) use incorrect\nconnectors at checkpoints to signal uncertainty and\nenable revision of faulty logic; (3) use correct con-\nnectors when prior logic is valid to confirm reason-\ning and move forward; (4) begin with an intention-\nally flawed reasoning path to promote reflective\ncorrection and generate extended traces.\nBy prompting verification at every reasoning\nstep and initially encouraging errors through con-\nnector usage, we ensure that reasoning chains re-\nmain appropriately concise. Furthermore, by ap-\nplying incorrect and correct connectors as needed,\nwe steer the process to achieve both exploration\nand convergence. Section 4.4 provides details on\nconnector usage.\n3.2\nCompact CoT\nReasoning models often suffer from excessively\nlong reasoning traces, which can lead to inef-\nficiency and even performance degradation on\nSystem-1 thinking tasks. To mitigate this issue, im-\npose explicit termination constraints by limiting the\nnumber of validations, bounding the trace length,\nand defining clear stopping conditions. Moreover,\nthe two types of connectors \u2014 incorrect connector\nand correct connector \u2014 further enhance the com-\npactness of the reasoning steps, with the correct\nconnector in particular facilitating concise progres-\nsion.\nBy alternating these two types of connectors,\nselectively guide the model to either expand or con-\nverge its reasoning process. This prevents unneces-\nsary elaboration and encourages timely termination,\npreserving overall reasoning performance while\nsignificantly improving performance on System-1\ntasks. The termination strategy consists of the fol-\nlowing rules: (1) Disallow consecutive use of con-\nnectors to avoid incoherent chaining of reasoning\nsteps; (2) skip further validation if the same answer\nis produced more than once; (3) invoke the termi-\nnation condition if the reasoning becomes unclear\nor overly repetitive; and (4) trigger termination if\nthe reasoning trace exceeds a predefined length or\nthe number of validations surpasses a threshold.\nBy preventing reasoning steps from expanding\nexcessively, we ensure suitably concise reasoning\ntraces. In particular, by imposing length limits and\ninstructions to avoid overly repetitive steps, we\nachieve efficient reasoning. While triggering the\ntermination condition does not directly improve ac-\ncuracy, it prevents trace length blow-up during data\ngeneration. As shown in Section 4.4, the correct\nconnector halts further progression upon successful\ninference, thereby promoting compactness.\n4\nExperiments\n4.1\nExperimental Setup\nIn this section, we describe our experimental setup\nand present the main findings of the dual-system\nbenchmark.\n4.1.1\nBenchmarks\nFor analytical System-2 thinking, we select widely\nused math-centric datasets of escalating difficulty \u2014\nAMC, AIME, GPQA, GSM8K and MATH. Collec-\ntively, these benchmarks pose problems that resist\neasy solutions, driving the model to explore multi-\nple angles and engage in deep reasoning, making\nthem suitable for validation analytical System-2\nthinking. For intuitive System-1 thinking, we adopt\nS1-Bench (Zhang et al., 2025), a collection of com-\nmonsense and rapid-inference questions that can\nusually be solved with minimal deliberation. By\ncontrasting performance across these two suites,\nwe can measure whether CAC-CoT preserves fast,\nconcise intuition while enhancing deep analytical\nskill.\n4.1.2\nBaselines\nTo contextualize the impact of CAC-CoT, we\nbenchmark against three recent models that rely\nsolely on SFT over Long-CoT data to achieve sub-\nstantial gains in reasoning performance via System-\n2 thinking. s1.1 (Muennighoff et al., 2025a), LIMO\n(Ye et al., 2025a), and Bespoke-Stratos (Labs,\n2025) all rely on SFT over a compact Long-\nCoT corpus synthesized by powerful reasoning\nengines (R1, R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, and QwQ, re-\nspectively) (Guo et al., 2025; DeepSeek-AI, 2025;\nTeam, 2025). Despite the modest data volume, each\nbaseline is reported to extract unexpectedly strong\nreasoning ability from its target model. s1.1 and\nBespoke-Stratos are evaluated exactly as released\nin huggingface (SimpleScaling Team, 2024; Labs,\n2024), maintaining full reproducibility. but, LIMO\nwas originally demonstrated on a Qwen-2.5-7b-\nInstruct that was not made public; we therefore\nreproduce the same method in ours (s1.1 train-\ning method), and perform an identical SFT run\non Qwen-2.5-7b-Instruct (Team, 2024) checkpoint\nto ensure a fair comparison.\n\nTable 1: System 1 thinking performance across models on S1-Bench.

For fine-tuning, we adopted Qwen-2.5-\n7B-Instruct as the base model. Our training fol-\nlowed the same hyperparameter configuration used\nin s1.1 to ensure comparability. Further implemen-\ntation details, including batch size, optimizer set-\ntings, and training duration, are provided in the\nAppendix A.\nDatasets. We generated our training data using\ngemini-2.0-flash, a cost-effective yet capable fron-\ntier model. During the data generation process, we\nfiltered out instances that exhibited generation er-\nrors or failed to follow our specified formatting\ninstructions. As a result, the total usable output was\nreduced. To ensure sufficient coverage and diver-\nsity, we supplemented this data with samples from\nthe LIMO and s1 datasets (Ye et al., 2025b; Muen-\nnighoff et al., 2025b). Specifically, we removed any\nduplicates between LIMO and s1 and excluded all\ncorrupted or invalid generations. After this filter-\ning process, we finalized a training set consisting\nof 1,391 examples. Details of the data generation\nprocess are provided in Appendix B.\n4.2\nSystem 1 Thinking\nAs summarized in Table 1, our experiments reveal\nthat CAC-CoT consistently achieves strong, state-\nof-the-art results on System-1 tasks.\nWe evaluate our method on the S1-Bench suite,\nwhich consists of tasks solvable via quick, intuitive\nreasoning (\u201cSystem-1\u201d thinking). These tasks gen-\nerally require little to no step-by-step deduction,\nso an effective effective should answer accurately\nwithout over-elaborating. On this benchmark, it per-\nforms on par with or slightly better than the base-\nlines in terms of accuracy: all methods achieve high\nscores on these easier queries (as expected), but im-\nportantly, ours does not sacrifice performance on\nsimple tasks despite its emphasis on CoT. In fact,\nCAC-CoT attains the highest overall ACC@5 and\nPASS@1 on S1-Bench (see Table 1), albeit with\nmarginal improvement since the baseline perfor-\nmance is near-saturated.\nCrucially, its responses on System-1 tasks are\n\nTable 2: System 2 thinking performance across benchmarks.

Our average reasoning\ntrace length is the shortest among all evaluated\nmethods on S1-Bench (see Table 1, ART), indicat-\ning that it avoids \u201coverthinking\u201d simple problems.\nThis connector-aware strategy compresses rea-\nsoning traces to roughly one-third the length of\nbaselines while preserving \u2014 and in some cases\nimproving \u2014 accuracy. By constraining unneces-\nsary expansion of the CoT, it sidesteps common\noverthinking pitfalls and shows that instruction-\nfollowing architectures \u2014 when guided by targeted\nconnector signals \u2014 can overcome the compliance\nweakness of seen in previous studies on Long CoT\nreasoning. Empirically, this design delivers over a\n20% point accuracy gain compared to both s1.1 and\nLIMO, confirming its strength on straightforward\nSystem-1 tasks without sacrificing deliberative per-\nformance.\n4.3\nSystem 2 Thinking\nCAC-CoT maintains strong performance on\nSystem-2 benchmarks, demonstrating compara-\nble reasoning ability to prior Long-CoT baselines.\nWhile there is a slight performance penalty relative\nto baseline models \u2014 whose results are detailed\nin Table 2 \u2014 the overall degradation is minor, and\nOurs successfully preserves analytical reasoning ca-\npabilities without relying on large-scale reasoning-\nspecialized traces.\nA key distinction lies in the construction of our\ntraining data. Unlike existing approaches that de-\npend heavily on dedicated reasoning models to\ngenerate Long-CoT corpora \u2014 often resulting in\nverbose outputs with excessive connector usage\n\u2014 it employs a connector-aware generation strat-\negy based ongemini-2.0-flash, a general-purpose\nbut instruction-aligned model. This allows us to\nretain the reasoning efficacy of connector-based\nCoT without inflating either the length of reason-\ning traces or the frequency of connector insertions.\nAs shown in Figure 2, our outputs are significantly\nmore compact, with the CAC-CoT cluster consis-\ntently positioned in the lower-left region, indicat-\ning fewer connectors and greater efficiency than\ncompeting models. In summary, CAC-CoT offers\na principled trade-off: it slightly underperforms the\nstrongest reasoning-optimized baselines, yet does\nso with far more economical prompting and with-\nout the bloat of overly long reasoning chains. This\nmakes it a compelling choice for efficient, scal-\nable reasoning under constrained data and compute\nregimes.\n\nTrajectory Length\n\n1000\n\n750\n\n500\n\n250 =\n\n35\n\n70\nConnector Count\n\n@ s1K-1.1 / Corrected=22\n@ LIMO / Corrected=23\n@ BESPOKE / Corrected=21\n\n@ OURS / Corrected=20\n\n105\n\nTable 3: Usage of Incorrect and Correct Connectors The light-blue highlighted phrases represent incorrect\nconnectors, which typically lead to revalidation or exploration of alternative reasoning paths.

Let\u2019s pause and rethink this. The pattern\ndoesn\u2019t seem obvious. Let\u2019s re-evaluate that approach. Instead of trying to\nfind a pattern, let\u2019s try to show that there are infinitely many losing positions.\nThis doesn\u2019t lead where we want it to. Let\u2019s pause and rethink this. Consider\nthe Sprague-Grundy theorem. Let g(n) be the Grundy value of n pebbles.\nHowever, this might not be the right path because the problem says that\n\u2206Erms depends on the rms value of the component of velocity along the line\nof sight. We used the full kinetic energy expression, but we should have used\nonly one component. Let\u2019s re-evaluate that approach.\nNow let\u2019s move to the equation for y(t).\ny(t) =\nR t\n0 e\u22122(t\u2212s){2x(s) + 3y(s)}ds. y(t) = e\u22122t \u2217(2x(t) + 3y(t)).\nTaking the Laplace transform: Y (p) = L{e\u22122t}L{2x(t) + 3y(t)}.\nY (p) =\n1\np+2(2X(p) + 3Y (p)). Y (p) =\n1\np+2(2( 2\np \u2212\n1\np+1) + 3Y (p)).\nY (p)(1 \u2212\n3\np+2) =\n2\np+2( 2\np \u2212\n1\np+1).

Let us assume that for some m, 4m + 2\nis a losing position. Now we want to show that we can find infinitely many\nnumbers of the form 4m + 2 are losing.\nWow, that actually makes a lot of sense now. Let an be a losing position if and\nonly if g(an) = 0. We know g(0) = 0 and g(2) = 0, so 0 and 2 are losing\npositions. We want to find infinitely many losing positions. Let\u2019s find g(n) for\nn \u226420.\nWow, that actually makes a lot of sense now.\nWe have N = 22011 \u00b7 2025078 (mod 1000). We have 2025078 \u226178\n(mod 1000). Also, we have 22011 \u2261211 (mod 1000), since 2100 \u2261376\n(mod 1000). Also 210 = 1024 \u226124 (mod 1000). Then 211 = 2048 \u226148\n(mod 1000). So, N \u226148 \u00b7 78 \u22613744 \u2261744 (mod 1000). Everything fits\ntogether nicely.\nLooks consistent with earlier steps. I think this is the correct approach using\nonly one degree of freedom to determine the temperature.\n\nTable 4: Connector usage comparison between open-\nsource LongCoT corpora and our corpus. Our corpus\nyields significantly shorter reasoning traces with lower\nconnector density compared to widely used open-source\nLongCoT datasets. Len: average trajectory length (to-\nkens).

Table 4 summarizes\nconnector usage and token lengths for our training\ncorpora versus the baselines. The Bespoke dataset\naverages approximately 4500 tokens per reasoning\ntrace with 5 connectors per 1000 tokens, while s1K\naverages around 9000 tokens and 5.5 connectors\nper 1000 tokens. In contrast, our connector-aware\ndata exhibits a far more controlled structure, with\nan average trace length of only 1850 tokens and just\n2.5 connectors per 1000 tokens. This demonstrates\nthat our data construction method yields an efficient\nreasoning corpus, which in turn benefits inference.\nFigure 2 shows connector counts and token lengths\nat inference time. As evident, the compact structure\nof the training data carries over to outputs: on aver-\nage the model uses only about 20 connectors and\nproduces fewer than 200 tokens per response. Base-\nline models, by comparison, sometimes exceed 500\ntokens or include over 70 connectors. Together with\nthe accuracy efficiency improvements reported in\nSections 4.2 and 4.3, these results confirm that our\nconnector-aware approach delivers both concise\nand efficiency reasoning.\nAdditionally, we perform a connector-aware\nqualitative analysis on the generated training data.\nTable 3 displays how the data patterns are struc-\ntured before and after each connector. The first\nis the incorrect connector, which reflects known\nmechanisms such as self-reflection and backtrack-\ning. Theses connectors encourage exploratory or\nverification-oriented reasoning. The second type is\nthe correct connector, which signals confirmation\nof the current reasoning path or indicates termina-\ntion of the reasoning process. The segments of text\nthat appear before and after each connector reflect\nits intended function, demonstrating how the logic\nis shaped in alignment with the connector type.\n5\nConclusion\nWe present a prompt-based, connector-aware com-\npact chain-of-thought framework that automati-\ncally generates high-quality reasoning traces with\nGemini-2.0-Flash and trains models exclusively\nthrough SFT. By enforcing depth limits and ex-\nplicit connector cues, our method produces concise\nyet coherent rationales that improve both reliability\nand efficiency. Extensive experiments confirm its\neffectiveness: the approach consistently surpasses\nstrong baselines across intuitive System-1 and ana-\nlytical System-2 benchmarks while operating with\nsignificantly lower computational overhead.\nLimitations\nThe findings reported here rest on two notable con-\nstraints. First, all experiments were performed with\na single model family, Qwen, leaving open the ques-\ntion of whether comparable improvements would\nmaterialize for other widely used backbones such\nas LLaMA or Gemma.\nSecond, all synthetic reasoning traces were gen-\nerated by Gemini-2.0-Flash, which risks conflat-\ning the method\u2019s true contribution with biases or\nstylistic conventions specific to that model. Incor-\nporating multiple generation sources or ensemble\nstrategies could help disentangle methodological\ngains from model-specific artifacts.\nBroadening both the range of base models and\nthe diversity of data-generation sources would thus\nprovide a more rigorous test of generalizability,\nrobustness, and transferability of the proposed ap-\nproach.\nReferences\nShivam Adarsh, Kumar Shridhar, Caglar Gulcehre,\nNicholas Monath, and Mrinmaya Sachan. 2024.\nSiked: Self-guided iterative knowledge distilla-\ntion for mathematical reasoning.\narXiv preprint\narXiv:2410.18574.\n\nAnthropic.\n2025.\nClaude\n3.7\nsonnet\nsystem\ncard.\nhttps://assets.anthropic.\ncom/m/785e231869ea8b3b/original/\nclaude-3-7-sonnet-system-card.pdf.\nQiguang Chen, Libo Qin, Jinhao Liu, Dengyun Peng,\nJiannan Guan, Peng Wang, Mengkang Hu, Yuhang\nZhou, Te Gao, and Wanxiang Che. 2025.

Specifically, we use Qwen2.5-\n7B-Instruct with the same hyperparameters as in\nprior work. The model is trained for 5 epochs with\na batch size of 16 and a gradient accumulation step\nof 4, using four NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs. How-\never, unlike previous datasets, our reasoning data\ncontains relatively long samples (approximately\n2,000 tokens on average), and thus we set the block\nsize to 4,000 to ensure full context coverage dur-\ning training. We also reproduce the LIMO baseline\n(denoted as LIMO-Reproduce) under the same hy-\nperparameter settings for performance comparison.\nThe only difference is the block size, which we set\nto 13,000 due to the length of the input and GPU\nmemory constraints. The full training configuration\nis summarized as follows:\nTable 5: Training Configuration\nParameter\nValue\nOptimizer\nAdamW (\u03b21 = 0.9, \u03b22 = 0.95)\nScheduler\nCosine\nLearning Rate\n1 \u00d7 10\u22125\nPer Device Train Batch Size\n1\nGradient Accumulation Steps\n4\nBlock Size\n4000\nWeight Decay\n1 \u00d7 10\u22124\nHardware\n4\u00d7NVIDIA A100 (80GB)\nB\nTraining Datasets\nTable 6 and Table 7 illustrate the exact prompt\nformat and connector types used during the reason-\ning data generation process.

In addition, Algorithm 1 outlines the constraint\nstrategies we adopted to control the reasoning flow\nand ensure coherence, including how specific con-\nnector types were encouraged under various gen-\neration conditions. To mitigate excessive data loss\ncaused by constraint filtering, we incorporate ad-\nditional samples from the s1 and LIMO datasets.\nWe then perform a thorough deduplication across\nall sources to preserve the uniqueness and integrity\nFigure 3: Connector redundancy distribution across\ndatasets.

In contrast, CAC-CoT-7B employs\nexplicit, context-aware connectors to structure its reasoning, including self-correction and targeted re-evaluation,\nresulting in more coherent and efficient problem solving.\nQuestion\nYou are playing a game. A 2 \u00d7 1 rectangle covers two adjacent squares (oriented either horizontally or\nvertically) of a 3 \u00d7 3 grid of squares, but you are not told which two squares are covered. Your goal is to\nfind at least one square that is covered by the rectangle. A \"turn\" consists of you guessing a square, after\nwhich you are told whether that square is covered by the hidden rectangle. What is the minimum number\nof turns you need to ensure that at least one of your guessed squares is covered by the rectangle?\ns1.1-7B\nOkay, so I need to figure out the minimum number of turns required to guarantee that at least one of the\nguessed squares is covered by a randomly placed 2x1 rectangle on a 3x3 grid.\nLet me start by visualizing the problem. First, the grid is 3x3, which means there are 9 squares. The\nhidden rectangle is either horizontal or vertical and covers two adjacent squares. So, there are two\npossible orientations: the rectangle can be placed horizontally (covering two squares in a row) or\nvertically (covering two squares in a column). For each orientation, the possible positions vary. Let me\ncount the number of possible rectangles. For horizontal rectangles: in a 3x3 grid, there are 2 possible\nrows (top or middle) and each row can have 2 starting positions (left or center).\nWait, no.\nWait, in a row of 3 squares, how many horizontal dominoes can be placed? Let\u2019s see. Each horizontal\ndomino covers two adjacent squares. In a row of 3, you can place it starting at the left (covers squares\n1-2) or starting at the center (covers squares 2-3). So, each row has 2 horizontal dominoes. Since there\nare 3 rows, but the problem says \"covers two adjacent squares\" which can be in any orientation.\nWait, no.\nWait, the problem says a 2x1 rectangle covers two adjacent squares. So, either horizontally or vertically.\nSo, horizontal dominoes are in rows, vertical dominoes are in columns. So, for horizontal dominoes:\neach row can have 2 possible positions. There are 3 rows, so total horizontal dominoes: 3*2 = 6. For\nvertical dominoes: each column can have 2 possible positions. There are 3 columns, so total vertical\ndominoes: 3*2 = 6. So total possible rectangles: 6 + 6 = 12.\nWait, but the problem states that the rectangle is placed randomly. So, the hidden rectangle can be any\nof these 12 possibilities.\n...\nThus, the smallest hitting set requires **four** squares, ensuring all possible dominoes are covered. 4\nCAC-CoT-7B\nLet\u2019s start with an incorrect attempt. Suppose we guess squares one by one until we find a covered\nsquare. In the worst case, we might guess squares that are not covered. The rectangle can cover at most\n2 squares. So, if we guess 3 squares, at least one of them must be covered. Thus, the minimum number\nof turns is 3.\nHowever, this might not be the right path because it doesn\u2019t consider the optimal strategy. Let\u2019s\nre-evaluate that approach. We want to minimize the number of turns while guaranteeing that we find a\ncovered square. The rectangle can be placed in different orientations (horizontal or vertical) and in\ndifferent positions on the 3 \u00d7 3 grid. Consider the first turn. If we guess the center square, what is the\nprobability that it\u2019s covered? If the rectangle is oriented horizontally, the center square is covered if the\nrectangle spans the middle row.

To\naddress this, we introduce MECAD, the first\nmultimodal, multi-scenario MECTEC dataset,\ncomprising 989 conversations from 56 TV se-\nries spanning a wide range of dialogue con-\ntexts. In addition, existing MECTEC methods\nfail to explicitly model emotional and causal\ncontexts and neglect the fusion of semantic in-\nformation at different levels, leading to per-\nformance degradation. In this paper, we pro-\npose M3HG, a novel model that explicitly cap-\ntures emotional and causal contexts and ef-\nfectively fuses contextual information at both\ninter- and intra-utterance levels via a multi-\nmodal heterogeneous graph. Extensive experi-\nments demonstrate the effectiveness of M3HG\ncompared with existing state-of-the-art meth-\nods. The codes and dataset are available at\nhttps://github.com/redifinition/M3HG.\n1\nIntroduction\nEmotion Cause Analysis in Conversations (ECAC)\naims at identifying emotions and their causes in\nconversations, which is a crucial research field\nin natural language processing (Li et al., 2022b;\nWang et al., 2023). However, most of ECAC re-\nsearch (Li et al., 2022b; Wang et al., 2023; Zheng\net al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023) only focuses on the\ntextual contexts, overlooking other modalities (So-\nleymani et al., 2017).\n* Corresponding authors.\n\u2020This work was supported in part by the National Natu-\nral Science Foundation of China under Grant 62476202 and\n62272343, in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the\nCentral Universities.\nTo address this limitation, Wang et al. (2022) pro-\nposed a new task called Multimodal Emotion Cause\nTriplet Extraction in Conversations (MECTEC).\nThe task aims to simultaneously identify the emo-\ntion utterance, the corresponding cause utterances,\nand the emotion category (i.e., the utter-cause-\nemotion triplet) from a conversation containing\nthree modalities: text, audio, and video. Figure 1\nillustrates a multimodal conversation between a\nmother and daughter. In this example, there are six\nnon-neutral utterances, and consequently, six utter-\ncause-emotion triplets are identified. MECTEC\ndiffers from ECAC in 1) multimodal contexts (i.e.,\ntext, audio, and video) resulting in more complex\nemotional expression, and 2) multi-scale semantic\ninformation from overall conversation and utter-\nance features like intonation and facial expressions,\nwhich pose significant challenges.\nAnother major challenge in MECTEC is the\nscarcity of datasets. While numerous text-based\ndatasets exist for ECAC, only one dataset, namely\nthe ECF dataset (Wang et al., 2022), is specifi-\ncally designed for MECTEC. However, the videos\nin ECF are all from the Friends TV series\nwith restricted speakers and scenarios, hindering\nMECTEC model development. Therefore, in this\nwork, a new multimodal, multi-scenario MECTEC\ndataset, namely MECAD, is constructed. To the\nbest of our knowledge, it is the first of its kind and\nwill greatly facilitate research in this field.\nConstrained by the limited dataset, existing\nMECTEC models have various deficiencies. Wang\net al. (2022) proposed a two-stage architecture that\npredicts emotion and cause utterances separately.\nHowever, this approach is computationally inten-\nsive and prone to error accumulation. Therefore, re-\ncent studies (Hu et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023; Li\net al., 2024a) propose one-stage architectures using\ngraph neural networks or prompt engineering to ex-\ntract utter-cause-emotion triplets. However, these\nmethods do not explicitly extract specific contexts\narXiv:2508.18740v1  [cs.CL]  26 Aug 2025\n\nActually, this is \npretty nice too.\n.\nYan Luo:\nWhat\u2019s nice?\nYunjie Wei:\nI haven\u2019t had your \ncooking in a while.\nYan Luo:\nI\u2019ll cook for you \nwhenever I\u2019m free!\nYunjie Wei :\nOkay.\nYan Luo:\nHow\u2019s the job \nsearch?\nYan Luo:\nNot easy for an \nold woman.\nYunjie Wei :\nUtterance 1\nUtterance 2\nUtterance 3\nUtterance 4\nUtterance 5\nUtterance 6\nUtterance 7\nHappy \ud83d\ude04\nHappy \ud83d\ude04\nHappy \ud83d\ude04\nHappy \ud83d\ude04\nHappy \ud83d\ude04\nNeutral \ud83d\ude36\nSad \ud83d\ude2d\ncause\ncause\ncause\ncause\ncause\ncause\nMECTEC output (Utter-cause-emotion Triplets)\n(U1, U3, happy), (U2, U1, happy), (U3, U3, happy), (U4, U3, happy), (U5, U4, happy), (U7, U6, sad)\nFigure 1: An example of the MECTEC task. Each utterance contains three different modalities - text, audio, and\nvideo. Arrows represent causal relationships that link the cause utterances to the corresponding emotion utterances.\nThe dashed box at the bottom lists all the <utter-cause-emotion> triplets identified in this example.\nrelated to emotions and their causes. According to\nemotion attribution theory (Weiner, 1985), the rela-\ntionships of emotions and their causes are revealed\nby specific contexts, such as emotional words in\ntexts, and intonations in audio and video conver-\nsations. For example, in Utterance 3 in Figure 1,\na pleasant facial expression indicates happiness,\nwhile \u201chaven\u2019t had your cooking\u201d and a happy tone\nreveal the cause. The example illustrates that emo-\ntions and their causes depend on contextual cues\nacross multiple modalities, highlighting the neces-\nsity of explicitly modeling their specific contexts.\nIn addition, previous work (Wang et al., 2022;\nHu et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024a;\nWei et al., 2020) fail to effectively identify the\ncause utterances occurring after emotion utter-\nances. For example, in Utterance 1 in Figure 1, the\nreason why Luo is happy cannot be obtained only\nfrom the historical context of Utterance 1. To find\nout the real cause of emotion in Utterance 1, the\nwhole conversation should be scrutinized, which is\noverlooked by previous work.\nFurthermore, existing models (Wang et al., 2022;\nHu et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024a)\nfail to adequately extract semantic information at\ndifferent scales. As shown in Figure 1, the seman-\ntic information that reveals the relationship of an\nutterance and its cause not only resides in inter-\nconnections between utterances but also resides\nin the intra-content of each utterance. Therefore,\nit\u2019s essential to comprehensively integrate seman-\ntic information in different scales during modality\nfusion.\nTo solve the aforementioned problems, we pro-\npose an MECTEC model based on the multimodal,\nmulti-scale, and multi-type node heterogeneous\ngraph, named M3HG. M3HG accurately extracts\nemotion and cause-related contexts and fuses mul-\ntimodal, multi-scale semantic information using\nmultimodal heterogeneous graph attention network\n(HGAT) with multi-type nodes.\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 The first Chinese multi-scenario MECTEC\ndataset, MECAD, and an online sentiment\ndata annotation toolkit are constructed. The\ndataset consists of 989 conversations with\n10,519 utterances annotated with important in-\nformation such as emotion labels, their causes,\nand types of emotional causes. It will greatly\nbenefit the development of models in the\nMECTEC and related fields.\n\u2022 An efficient MECTEC model, namely M3HG,\nis proposed to identify utter-cause-emotion\ntriplets from multimodal conversations. It ex-\nplicitly extracts specific emotion and cause-\nrelated contexts to find connections between\nemotions and causes. Besides, it fully inte-\ngrates semantic information from inter and\nintra-utterance levels to enhance the model\u2019s\npredictive ability.\n\u2022 Extensive experiments are performed to verify\nthe performance of our proposed model and\nother state-of-the-art models on MECAD and\nECF datasets. Experimental results reveal that\nM3HG outperforms its counterparts, which\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of our model.\n2\nRelated Works\nEmotion Cause Analysis in Conversations. Most\nexisting studies on ECAC focus on Causal Emotion\nEntailment (CEE) and Emotion Cause Pair Extrac-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3 |\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntion in Conversations (ECPEC). CEE aims to iden-\ntify which cause utterances trigger the non-neutral\nemotions of the target utterances. Since CEE as-\nsumes emotion utterances are given, most related\nwork (Poria et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022a; Zhang\net al., 2022; Gu et al., 2023) viewed CEE as an ut-\nterance classification problem. However, because\nemotions of utterances are often unknown in real-\nworld conversations, Li et al. (2022b) proposed the\nECPEC task which additionally predicts emotions\nfor the target utterances. Subsequent work (Wang\net al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023) has incorporated\ncommonsense knowledge into GATs to improve\nthe model\u2019s semantic understanding of emotions\nand causes, achieving better performance. Besides,\nsome methods (Ding et al., 2020a,b; Wei et al.,\n2020; Zheng et al., 2022) from models in the Emo-\ntion cause Pair Extraction (ECPE) field are also\nadapted for the ECPEC task.\nMultimodal Emotion Cause Triplet Extraction\nin Conversations. In recent years, multimodal con-\nversation scenarios on social media platforms have\ngrown significantly, as more individuals share their\nlives and express emotions through live stream-\ning and various online chats. To advance emotion\ncause analysis in multimodal conversation scenar-\nios, Wang et al. (2022) introduced the MECTEC\ntask and released the ECF dataset. However, few\nsolutions have been proposed for this recently intro-\nduced task. Li et al. (2024a) incorporated emotion\ntransition information into emotion-cause pair ex-\ntraction using a novel labeling constraint, while\nHu et al. (2024) fused semantic information across\nmodalities via prompt engineering. These meth-\nods treat multimodal fusion and contextual infor-\nmation extraction for emotional causes as sepa-\nrate processes. Furthermore, they fail to effec-\ntively integrate semantic information across differ-\nent scales, which significantly hampers the overall\nperformance of models in the MECTEC task. To\naddress these issues, we propose a model that fully\nintegrates multi-scale semantic information from\ndifferent modalities, preventing the loss of con-\ntextual information during fusion and improving\ntriplet extraction accuracy.\nDatasets for the ECAC Task. Table 1 summarizes\npopular datasets in ECAC. Poria et al. (2021) in-\ntroduced the RECCON dataset for the ECAC task,\nand Li et al. (2022b) extended it by building the\nConvECPE dataset. Given the multimodal nature\nof conversations, Wang et al. (2022) developed the\nECF dataset for MECTEC. However, all scenes\nTable 1: A summary of datasets for ECAC task.

Compared with\nECF (Wang et al., 2022), MECAD has more diverse\nconversation scenarios. In addition to labeling emo-\ntion categories and their causes for each utterance,\nwe also categorized the types of emotion causes\n(e.g., event, expression) and the modality of anno-\ntation (i.e., text, audio, or video) to support future\nstudies in multimodal emotion cause analysis.\nWe selected the publicly available M3ED (Zhao\net al., 2022) dataset as our data source, which con-\ntains 990 segments from 56 Chinese TV series.\nHowever, M3ED dataset only contains conversa-\ntion scripts, audios, and screenshots, lacking cor-\nresponding videos. Therefore, we endeavored to\ncollect the corresponding video segments based on\nthe conversation timestamps provided by M3ED.\nWe concatenated sentences to form 989 multimodal\nconversations with 10,516 full utterances.\nWe invited 10 Chinese graduate students ma-\njored in Psychology to annotate the corresponding\ncause utterances, the types of emotion causes and\nthe modal cues of annotations in the conversations.\nTo obtain high-quality annotations, we designed\ndetailed guidelines based on previous studies (Dir-\nven, 1997; Steptoe and Brydon, 2009), trained the\nvolunteers, and tested them with annotation cases.\nOnly those passing the test participated in the final\nannotation process. Each volunteer was paid $50\nfor their annotations. Then, we randomly assigned\nthree qualified annotators for each conversation. If\ndivergence exists among annotations from different\nvolunteers, the final annotation for the utterance\nis determined by majority voting. Two strategies\nwere used to review and revise incorrect annota-\ntions: 1) Annotation consistency among the three\nannotators for each TV series is calculated. For se-\nries with low consistency, the annotators rechecked\n\nand revised their labels as needed. 2) If disagree-\nments remained, a fourth annotator was invited to\nrelabel the utterances and make the final decision.\nTo enhance annotation efficiency and accuracy,\nwe developed an online multimodal conversation\nemotion cause annotation tool. The interface of the\nannotation tool is shown in Figure 3 in Appendix B.\nThis tool is highly reusable and user-friendly, mak-\ning it ideal for related research in the future.\nWe use Cohen\u2019s Kappa (Cohen, 1960) to assess\npairwise agreement and Fleiss\u2019s Kappa (McHugh,\n2012) for overall consistency among annotators.\nThe Cohen\u2019s Kappa results are in Appendix A, and\nthe Fleiss\u2019s Kappa score of 0.6932 exceeds the\nthreshold of 0.61 (Landis, 1977), confirming the\nstatistical reliability of our annotations.\nThe dataset statistics and detailed analysis of\nMECAD are presented in Figure 4 in Appendix A.\nMECAD provides solid support for assessing the\nperformance and generalization capabilities of\nMECTEC models in broader scenarios.\n4\nFramework of Proposed M3HG\n4.1\nTask Definition\nGiven a conversation C = {(Si, Ui)}1\u2264i\u2264n, where\nSi denotes the speaker of the i-th utterance Ui, n\ndenotes the length of the conversation C, Ui =\n{Ut\ni , Ua\ni , Uv\ni }, and t, a, v are the text, audio and\nvideo modality, respectively. The goal of MECTEC\nis to identify all the utter-cause-emotion triplets\nfrom the conversation C:\nP = {(U e\nj , U c\nj , ye\nj)},\n(1)\nwhere U e\nj is the j-th utterance with emotion ye\nj,\nU c\nj is the corresponding cause utterance, and ye\nj \u2208\n{Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise} (Ek-\nman, 1992).\n4.2\nModel Overview\nM3HG is an end-to-end (E2E) MECTEC model, as\nillustrated in Figure 2. It consists of four key com-\nponents: unimodal feature extraction, graph con-\nstruction, multi-scale semantic fusion, and emotion-\ncause classification.\nIn unimodal feature extraction, M3HG extracts\nlocal contextual representations for each utterance\nusing modality-specific feature extractors and uni-\nmodal encoders. In graph construction, M3HG\nconstructs a conversation interaction graph using\nthese feature representations to explicitly model\nthe emotion and cause-related contexts. In multi-\nscale semantic fusion, M3HG combines semantic\ninformation at different scales within the conversa-\ntion interaction graph to produce a comprehensive\nfeature representation of both emotion and cause\ncontexts. In emotion-cause classification, emo-\ntion and cause contextual representations are con-\ncatenated and used to extract utter-cause-emotion\ntriplets with with position embedding.\n4.3\nUnimodal Feature Extraction\nFirst,\nwe utilize SA-RoBERTa (Gu et al.,\n2020), Wav2Vec2 (Baevski et al., 2020), and\nDenseNet (Huang et al., 2017) to extract three fea-\nture representations Et, Ea, and Ev, from text,\naudio, and video, respectively, where Et \u2208Rn\u00d7dt,\nEa \u2208Rn\u00d7da, and Ev \u2208Rn\u00d7dv, and dt, da, dv\nrepresent dimensions of the hidden layer represen-\ntations of the three modalities. The extraction pro-\ncess is described in Appendix C.1.\nThen, we encode each feature representation\nwithin an unimodal local context. For text, we\napply multi-head self-attention (Vaswani, 2017) to\nEt to capture local contextual information, result-\ning in Ht. For Ea and Ev, we use a GRU-based\nnetwork (Li et al., 2024b) to extract local context\nby leveraging the RNN structure\u2019s capability to\nhandle temporal features, which is expressed as:\nE\u2032m = LN(Em + GRU(Em)),\nHm = LN(Em + E\u2032m + FFN(E\u2032m),\n(2)\nwhere Hm \u2208Rn\u00d7dm, m \u2208{a, v}, LN denotes\nlayer normalization, and FFN denotes a feedfor-\nward neural network.\nAfter encoding the local context for each modal-\nity, we obtain the sequence representations Ht,\nHa, Hv for text, audio, and video. We then apply\nthree linear layers to map Ht, Ha, Hv to H\u2032t,\nH\u2032a, H\u2032v with the same dimension dh.\n4.4\nGraph Construction\nTo enable M3HG to fuse multi-scale semantic in-\nformation across modalities, we construct a het-\nerogeneous graph that represents both inter- and\nintra-utterance connections, as well as cross-modal\ninteractions. The structure of this heterogeneous\ngraph can be denoted by G = (V, E, R), where V\nis the node set consisting of all graph nodes vi, R\nis the relation set consisting of all relations rij be-\ntween any two nodes vi and vj, and E is the edge set\nconsisting of all edges represented as (vi, rij, vj).\n\n\ud835\udc7c\ud835\udfcf\n\ud835\udc95\n\ud835\udc7c\ud835\udfd0\n\ud835\udc95\n\ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc95\n. . .\n\ud835\udc6f\ud835\udfcf\n\"\ud835\udc95\n \ud835\udc6f\ud835\udfd0\n\"\ud835\udc95\n\ud835\udc6f\ud835\udc8f\"\ud835\udc95\n. . .\nPLM\nUnimodal \nEncoder\nS1: Actually, this \nis pretty nice too. \nS2:What\u2019s nice?...\nTextual Modality\n\ud835\udc7c\ud835\udfcf\n\ud835\udc97\n\ud835\udc7c\ud835\udfd0\n\ud835\udc97\n\ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc97\n. . .\n\ud835\udc6f\ud835\udfcf\n\"\ud835\udc97\n \ud835\udc6f\ud835\udfd0\n\"\ud835\udc97\n \ud835\udc6f\ud835\udc8f\"\ud835\udc97\n. . .\nVFE\nUnimodal \nEncoder\nVisual Modality\n...\nAudio Modality\n\ud835\udc7c\ud835\udfcf\n\ud835\udc82\n\ud835\udc7c\ud835\udfd0\n\ud835\udc82\n\ud835\udc7c\ud835\udfcf\n\ud835\udc82\n. . .\n\ud835\udc6f\ud835\udfcf\n\"\ud835\udc82\n \ud835\udc6f\ud835\udfd0\n\"\ud835\udc82\n \ud835\udc6f\ud835\udc8f\"\ud835\udc82\n. . .\nAFE\nUnimodal \nEncoder\ndifferent speaker \nsame speaker\nglobal connection \nemotion connection\ncause connection\nutterance super-node\nconversation super-node\nemotional context node\ncausal context node \n\ud835\udc81\ud835\udfcf\n\ud835\udc86\n \ud835\udc81\ud835\udfcf\n\ud835\udc84\n. . . \n\ud835\udc81\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc86\n \ud835\udc81\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc84\nPosition \nEmbedding\nPosition \nEmbedding\nEmotion MLP\n. . . \n\ud83d\ude04\n\ud83d\ude2b\n \ud835\udc86#\ud835\udfcf\n \ud835\udc86#\ud835\udc8f\nCause MLP\n. . . \n \ud835\udc84#\ud835\udfcf\n \ud835\udc84#\ud835\udc8f\n0/1\n0/1\nLP MLP\n. . . \n \ud835\udc86\ud835\udc84\n%\ud835\udfcf\n \ud835\udc86\ud835\udc84\n%\ud835\udc8f\n0/1\n0/1\n(a) Unimodal Feature Extraction\n(c) Emotion-cause Classification\n(b) Graph Construction and Multi-scale Semantic  Fusion\nInter-utterance-level \nFusion\nIntra-utterance-level \nFusion\nNode-level Attention\nSemantic Attention\nHAN Layer\nPFFN Layer\nFigure 2: The framework of proposed M3HG. It consists of three main components: unimodal feature extraction,\ngraph construction and multi-scale semantic fusion, and emotion-cause classification.\nNodes. To explicitly model emotion and cause-\nrelated contexts in conversations, we model them\nas emotional context nodes Ne and causal con-\ntext nodes Nc, respectively. To enable G to accu-\nrately perceive the conversation information, we\nmodel the whole conversation as a conversation\nnode. Each utterance is represented by an utter-\nance node. Both the utterance node and conversa-\ntion node are designed as Super-Nodes containing\nthese modalities, denoted as SNu and SNd, since\nthey contain three modal features. Therefore, G\ncontains four types of nodes: Ne, Nc, SNu and\nSNd.\nNe and Nc are first initialized with textual se-\nquence representations H\u2032t, then updated with con-\ntextual information from the other two modalities,\nwhich is described in Section 4.5.\nEach utter-\nance Super-Node SNu = {Nt, Na, Nv} is initial-\nized using H\u2032t, H\u2032a, H\u2032v. The conversation node\nSNd = {Nt\nd, Na\nd , Nv\nd } is initialized by averaging\nH\u2032t, H\u2032a, H\u2032v to capture global information.\nEdges and Relations.\nThere are five types of\nSuper-Edges connecting the aforementioned Super-\nNodes: same speaker (rss), different speaker (rds),\nglobal connection (rgc), emotion connection (rec)\nand cause connection (rcc). The same speaker edge\nconnects the utterance Super-Nodes SNu from the\nsame speaker. Inspired by the work of Shen et al.\n(2021), we define the local context as K preceding\nutterances from the same speaker of SNu, where\nK is a hyper-parameter. The different speaker edge\nconnects the utterance Super-Nodes within the lo-\ncal context from different speakers to SNu. The\nbidirectional global connection edge connects all\nthe utterance Super-Nodes SNus with the conver-\nsation Super-Node SNd, facilitating the propaga-\ntion of global contextual information. The emotion\nconnection edge and the cause connection edge\nconnect SNu with its corresponding emotional\ncontext node Ne and causal context node Nc, re-\nspectively. They explicitly capture the emotion and\ncause context specific to each utterance.\nM3HG is the first MECTEC model capable of\nhandling situations where cause utterances ap-\npear after emotion utterances, as each utterance\nis linked through the global connection node. The\ndetailed experiments in Appendix E.2 further val-\nidate this capability. The pseudo-code of graph\nconstruction and a constructed graph for the con-\nversation in Figure 1 are provided in Appendix C.2\nand Appendix C.3, respectively. The graph con-\nstruction process of M3HG can be expressed as:\nG = (V, E, R),\nV = {SNu\ni , Ne\ni , Nc\ni , SNd}1\u2264i\u2264n,\nSNu\ni = {Nt\ni , Na\ni , Nv\ni },\nSNd = {Nt\nd, Na\nd , Nv\nd },\nR = {rss, rds, rgc, rec, rcc},\nE = {(vi, rij, vj)}, vi, vj \u2208V, r \u2208R,\n(3)\nwhere superscripts u, e, c, d denote node types, and\nm denotes three modalities. Based on the con-\nstructed graph G, the emotion and cause contexts\nare effectively modeled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3 |\n\n\n\n4.5\nMulti-scale Semantic Information Fusion\nBased on graph G, we designed a comprehensive\napproach to integrate semantic information across\ndifferent modalities and scales. This mechanism\nis implemented in two levels: intra-utterance fu-\nsion which captures emotion and cause-related con-\ntexts within utterances, and inter-utterance fusion\nwhich propagates semantic information among ut-\nterances and conversation-level contexts. Both lev-\nels leverage HGAT (Wang et al., 2019) to propa-\ngate and fuse semantic information through vari-\nous meta-paths (Wang et al., 2019) within G. This\nensures thorough updates to node features by inte-\ngrating multi-scale semantic information.\nThe meta-paths in G are defined as:\n\u03a6 = {\u03d5(vi, rij, vj)}, vi, vj \u2208V,\n\u03d5(vi, rij, vj) = vi\nrij\n\u2190\u2192vj, rij \u2208R,\n(4)\nwhere \u03d5(vi, rij, vj) represents all paths that con-\nnect node vi to node vj via edge type rij.\nIntra-utterance-level Fusion. As shown in Fig-\nure 2, for each utterance Super-Node SNu, we\nperform intra-utterance-level fusion by integrating\nsemantic information within the utterance. We de-\nfine the meta-path \u03a6intra for intra-utterance-level\nsemantic fusion for SNu\nn as:\n\u03a6intra ={\u03d5 (Nm1, Nm2, rm1,m2)}\n\u222a{\u03d5 (Nm, Ne, rm,e)}\n\u222a{\u03d5 (Nm, Nc, rm,c)},\n(5)\nwhere m1, m2, m \u2208{t, a, v}, Nm represents the\nnodes of modality m within the SNu, and rm1,m2\ndenotes the edges connecting Nm1 and Nm2. rm,e\ndenotes edges connecting nodes Nm to the emo-\ntional context nodes Ne, facilitating the aggrega-\ntion of emotional contexts conveyed by different\nmodalities within the utterance. Similarly, rm,c rep-\nresents the edges that connect Nm to the causal con-\ntext nodes Nc, enabling the aggregation of causal\ncontexts. \u03a6intra effectively models the process of\nsemantic information fusion in a single utterance.\nNext, we incorporate node-level attention into\n\u03a6intra. For each meta-path in \u03a6intra and nodes\nvi \u2208{Nm, Ne, Nc}, the importance of its neigh-\nbors Ni in \u03a6intra is computed as:\n\u03b1\u03d5\nij =\nexp\n\u0000\u03c3\n\u0000aT\n\u03d5 \u00b7\n\u0002\nH\u2032\ni \u2225H\u2032\nj\n\u0003\u0001\u0001\nP\nk\u2208N \u03d5\ni exp\n\u0010\n\u03c3\n\u0010\naT\n\u03d5 \u00b7 [H\u2032\ni \u2225H\u2032\nk]\n\u0011\u0011,\n\u03d5 \u2208\u03a6intra,\n(6)\nwhere \u03c3 denotes the activation function, and a\u03d5 is\nthe node-level attention vector of meta-path \u03d5. The\nnode representation of vi based on meta-path \u03d5 is\nobtained by:\nZi = \u03c3(\nX\nj\u2208N \u03d5\ni\n\u03b1\u03d5\nij \u00b7 H\u2032\nj).\n(7)\nThis process yields the contextual features Zi \u2208\nR1\u00d7dh for nodes vi under the intra-utterance-level\nmeta-paths \u03a6intra.\nInter-utterance-level Fusion. As illustrated in Fig-\nure 2, for any two utterance Super-Nodes SNu\ni and\nSNu\nj in G, along with the conversation Super-Node\nSNd, we perform inter-utterance-level fusion by\nconnecting SNu\ni and SNu\nj to SNd, thereby inte-\ngrating contextual information across utterances.\nWe define meta-paths \u03a6inter for inter-utterance-\nlevel fusion between SNu and SNd:\n\u03a6inter ={\u03d5(Nm1\ni\n, Nm2\nj\n, rm1,m2)}\n\u222a{\u03d5(Nm\ni , Nm\nd , rd,m)}\n\u222a{\u03d5(Nm\nj , Nm\nd , rd,m)},\n(8)\nwhere m1, m2, m \u2208{t, a, v}, Nm\ni\nand Nm\nj\nrep-\nresent the nodes of modality m inside SNu\ni and\nSNu\nj , respectively, rm1,m2 denotes the edges con-\nnecting Nm1\ni\nand Nm2\nj\n, and rd,m represents the\nedges connecting SNus to SNd in modality m.\nThe utterance information from each modality\ncan be passed to SNd though \u03a6inter, which ac-\ncomplishes inter-utterance-level fusion between ut-\nterances. As a result, SNd comprehensively inte-\ngrates information across all three modalities. The\nmeta-path set \u03a6inter models multimodal connec-\ntions between utterances, enabling conversation\ninformation aggregated in G.\nSimilar to Eq. 6 and Eq. 7, the contextual repre-\nsentations of SNu and SNd are obtained under the\nmeta-path \u03a6inter by the node-level attention block.\nAfter performing multi-scale semantic fusion\nwith \u03a6intra and \u03a6inter, we apply the semantic at-\ntention mechanism (Wang et al., 2019) to each node\nembedding Zi, integrating multi-scale semantic\ninformation from all three modalities. Following\n(Chen et al., 2023), each fusion iteration is followed\nby a position-wise feed-forward network (PFFN)\nlayer, which updates node features through a non-\nlinear transformation. The emotional context node\nrepresentation Ze\ni and the causal context node fea-\nture representation Zc\ni can be obtained at the end\nof iterations of the multi-scale semantic fusion and\nPFFN layers.\n\n4.6\nEmotion-cause classification\nFor each utterance Ui, its Ze\ni and Zc\ni are fed into\nthe emotion-specific Multi-Layer Perceptron (Emo-\ntion MLP) and the cause-specific Multi-Layer Per-\nceptron (Cause MLP) to predict its emotion cate-\ngory \u02c6ye\ni and the cause indicator \u02c6yc\ni which indicates\nwhether Ui can be a cause utterance. For each\nutterance pair Ui and Uj, we compute a relative\nposition encoding RPEij to capture the positional\nrelationship between Ui and Uj. We utilize the\nRBF kernel function (Wei et al., 2020) to compute\nRPEij, which captures the relative positional rela-\ntionships between utterances through a nonlinear\nrelation. Ze\nj , Zc\ni and RPEij are then concatenated\nand fed into a new MLP to determine whether Ui\nis the cause utterance of Uj:\n\u02c6yec\nij = \u03c3(MLP(Zj\ne||Zic||RPEij).\n(9)\n\u02c6yec\nij represent the binary classification logits indicat-\ning whether Ui is the cause of Uj. Based on \u02c6yec\nij ,\nwe can determine whether Uj, Ui and \u02c6ye\nj can form\na true utter-cause-emotion triplet.\n4.7\nTraining\nWe use Focal loss (Ross and Doll\u00e1r, 2017) to cope\nwith category imbalance in emotion-cause classi-\nfication. Specifically, the loss of both emotion\nprediction and cause utterance prediction and the\nemotion-cause pair prediction, can be expressed as:\nL\u03b2 = \u22121\nN\u03b2\nN\u03b2\nX\ni=1\n\u03b1\u03b2(1\u2212\u02c6y\u03b2\ni )\u03b3 log(\u02c6y\u03b2\ni ), \u03b2 \u2208{e, c, ec}\n(10)\nwhere \u03b2 represents the task type, N\u03b2 denotes the\ncorresponding sample number of \u03b2, \u03b1\u03b2 is the cate-\ngory balancing factor, and \u03b3 denotes the Focal loss\nmodulation parameter. These three training losses\nare optimized jointly during the training process.\n5\nEXPERIMENTS\n5.1\nExperimental Settings\nWe\nconduct\nextensive\nexperiments\non\ntwo\nMECTEC benchmark datasets, i.e., ECF (Wang\net al., 2022) and MECAD, which both contain data\nof three modalities: text, audio, and video. Similar\nto (Wang et al., 2022), we evaluate the model\u2019s\noverall performance using the F1 score. The F1\nscore is computed for utter-cause-emotion triplets\nwithin each emotion category separately. Then the\nweighted average F1 score is calculated across all\nsix emotion categories which is referred to 6 Avg.\nIn addition, as in (Wang et al., 2023), considering\nthe data imbalance among different emotion cat-\negories, we also report the weighted average F1\nscores for the four main emotion categories except\nDisgust and Fear, which is referred to 4 Avg. The\nimplementation details of the experiment are given\nin Appendix D.\n5.2\nBaselines\nDue to the limited research on the MECTEC task,\nrepresentative approaches in related fields of Emo-\ntion Cause Pair Extraction (ECPE) and Emotion\nCause Pair Extraction in Conversations (ECPEC)\nare considered. The ECPE and ECPEC tasks aim\nto extract emotion-cause pairs from plain texts and\nconversations, respectively.\nWe compare our model with seven baselines:\n1) MC-ECPE-2steps (Wang et al., 2022) is a\ntwo-step MECTEC architecture, which first ex-\ntracts emotion utterances and cause utterances sep-\narately, and then performs pairing and filtering to\nidentify emotion-cause pairs. 2) HiLo (Li et al.,\n2024a) is one of the SOTA approaches for the\nMECTEC task, which fully utilizes conversion\ninformation through a labeling constraint mech-\nanism. 3) ECPE-2D (Ding et al., 2020a) is an E2E\nframework for ECPE that uses 2D-Transformer to\nmodel the interactions of emotion-cause pairs. 4)\nRankCP (Wei et al., 2020) is a GAT-based ap-\nproach for ECPE to extract emotion-cause pairs by\nranking. 5) UECA-Prompt (Zheng et al., 2022) is\none of the SOTA methods for ECPE, which decom-\nposes the task into multiple objectives and converts\nthem into sub-prompts. 6) SHARK (Wang et al.,\n2023) is the SOTA method for ECPEC that incor-\nporates commonsense into GATs to improve the\nmodel\u2019s semantic understanding of emotions and\ncauses. 7) GPT-4o is one of the most powerful\nlarge language models (LLMs) for open-domain\nconversations. Details of prompts are provided in\nAppendix F.\n5.3\nExperimental Results\nTable 2 shows the experimental results of M3HG\nand seven baseline models evaluated on the ECF\ndataset and the MECAD dataset.\nOur model\ndemonstrates an excellent performance both on the\nECF dataset and the MECAD dataset.\nResults on the ECF dataset.

The best results\nand the second best results are in bold and underlined, respectively. Since HiLo (Li et al., 2024a) is not publicly\navailable, we only report the results of HiLo on the ECF dataset.\nbest performance, indicating that the E2E frame-\nwork is more effective compared to the two-step\npipeline frameworks. In contrast, M3HG adopting\nthree modalities outperforms the SOTA E2E model\nHiLo, with 21.28% and 17.17% improvement in\n6 Avg and 4 Avg scores, respectively. We attribute\nthis improvement to M3HG\u2019s ability to effectively\nextract semantic information at inter-utterance and\nintra-utterance levels, which enables the model to\naccurately pair emotion utterances and cause ut-\nterances. Specifically, in two challenging emotion\ncategories which have limited training samples, i.e.\nDisgust and Fear, M3HG also exhibits high per-\nformances. For example, compared to GPT-4o,\nwhich achieved the second highest F1 scores in\nthe Disgust and Fear categories, M3HG shows im-\nprovements of 31.36% and 58.46%, respectively.\nWhen only incorporating the text modality, the\n6 Avg and the 4 Avg scores of M3HG are 37.46\nand 39.95. When incorporating audio and video\nwith the text modality separately, the performance\nof M3HG is improved to 39.10, 38.90 of 6 Avg\nscores and 40.97, 40.72 of 4 Avg scores. When\nincorporating all three modalities, M3HG achieves\nthe highest performance with 40.07 of 6 Avg scores\nand 41.96 of 4 Avg scores. Meanwhile, it can be\nobserved that M3HG outperforms all the baseline\nmodels even when only using the text modality,\ndemonstrating its superiority on the ECF dataset.\nResults on the MECAD dataset. As shown in\nTable 2, M3HG also achieves the highest results on\nthe MECAD dataset. Compared to the second best\nmodel SHARK, M3HG adopting three modalities\nachieves the improvement of 19% on the 6 Avg\nscores and 15.34% on the 4 Avg score. Furthermore,\ndespite GPT-4o\u2019s superior semantic comprehension\nabilities, its performance on the MECAD dataset\nremains suboptimal, with its 6 Avg score and 4 Avg\nscore of 27.16 and 28.42. Therefore, the few-shot-\nbased LLM approach still struggles to effectively\nhandle the MECTEC task. As shown in Table 2,\nM3HG exhibits a universal highest performance on\nthe MECAD dataset, demonstrating the superiority\nand robustness of M3HG when dealing with multi-\nconversation scenarios.\nMore detailed experimental results and the abla-\ntion study on M3HG are presented in Appendix E.\n6\nConclusion\nIn this work, we propose the first multimodal\nand multi-scenario Chinese emotion-cause analysis\ndataset, MECAD, for MECTEC and related emo-\ntion cause analysis tasks. Compared to ECF, the\nonly existing dataset for multimodal emotion-cause\nanalysis, MECAD offers more diverse conversation\nscenarios. It helps to enhance the generalizability\nand applicability of MECTEC models in complex\nsocial media environments. Moreover, MECAD\nis a valuable resource for cross-cultural emotion\nanalysis and recognition. Furthermore, we propose\n\na generalized MECTEC framework named M3HG,\nwhich deeply extracts emotional and causal con-\ntexts, while effectively integrating semantic infor-\nmation across multiple granular levels. Extensive\nexperiments on the ECF dataset and the MECAD\ndataset demonstrate the superiority of our method\ncompared to the existing state-of-the-art methods.\nLimitations\nThere are also some potential limitations in this\nwork. First, the process of emotional and causal\ncontext extraction does not integrate external\nknowledge, which limits the model\u2019s accuracy for\nemotion prediction and cause prediction. In the\nfuture, we plan to integrate external knowledge\ninto our model and leverage the advanced seman-\ntic extraction capabilities of current LLM technol-\nogy to facilitate deeper and more precise emotion\ncause analysis. Second, M3HG cannot handle ex-\ncessively long conversations, as its input length is\nconstrained by the language model used. Further-\nmore, M3HG may suffer from error propagation in\nthe multimodal fusion process when emotion labels\nhave uneven information across modalities. This\nimbalance can lead to inaccurate predictions, espe-\ncially when modalities conflict. This challenge is\ncommon in current multimodal models for emotion-\ncause analysis and suggests an area for future im-\nprovement.\nEthical Considerations\nWe did not use real-world conversations in our data\ncollection because such conversations may violate\nthe privacy of the speaker. The effect of recruiting\nactors to play the roles is the same as in the TV\nseries, but the scenes are not as diverse as in the\nTV series. Therefore, we use TV series as the\ndata source. To further protect privacy, all data\nannotations were anonymized and de-identified,\nensuring that our data collection adheres to ethical\nstandards.\nReferences\nAlexei Baevski, Yuhao Zhou, Abdelrahman Mohamed,\nand Michael Auli. 2020. wav2vec 2.0: A framework\nfor self-supervised learning of speech representations.\nAdvances in neural information processing systems,\n33:12449\u201312460.\nTiantian Chen, Ying Shen, Xuri Chen, Lin Zhang, and\nShengjie Zhao. 2023.

The dataset contains a total of\n989 conversations, 10,516 utterances, and 8,077\nemotion cause pairs from 56 different TV series,\nwhich ensures the size and diversity of the dataset.\nSimilar to M3ED (Zhao et al., 2022), we used TV-\nindependent data segmentation to ensure the abil-\nity to validate model robustness as a benchmark\ndataset. The average number of utterances and the\naverage length of an utterance of a conversation are\nsimilar in the training, validation, and test sets. At\nthe same time, we can find that the average relative\npositions of the emotion cause pairs are all around\n\nFigure 3: The interface of the developed online multi-\nmodal conversation emotion cause annotation toolkit.\na1\na2\na3\na4\na5\na6\na7\na8\na9\na10\na1\na2\na3\na4\na5\na6\na7\na8\na9\na10\n0.6570\n0.6791\n0.7140\n0.6718\n0.6479\n0.6884\n0.6189\n0.6510\n0.6825\n0.6570\n0.6367\n0.6826\n0.5752\n0.5734\n0.6196\n0.6438\n0.6498\n0.6259\n0.6791\n0.6367\n0.6425\n0.6133\n0.6260\n0.6970\n0.6775\n0.7140\n0.6826\n0.6425\n0.6366\n0.6753\n0.6831\n0.7061\n0.6472\n0.6683\n0.6718\n0.5752\n0.6133\n0.6366\n0.6366\n0.6623\n0.6408\n0.6479\n0.5734\n0.6753\n0.6734\n0.6983\n0.6826\n0.7193\n0.6884\n0.6196\n0.6831\n0.6734\n0.7339\n0.6968\n0.6189\n0.6438\n0.6260\n0.7061\n0.6366\n0.6983\n0.7339\n0.6938\n0.6510\n0.6510\n0.6498\n0.6970\n0.6472\n0.6623\n0.6826\n0.6968\n0.6938\n0.6669\n0.6825\n0.6259\n0.6775\n0.6683\n0.6408\n0.7193\n0.6510\n0.6669\nFigure 4: Schematic representation of Cohen\u2019s Kappa\nscores for the common labeled portion between every\ntwo annotators.

To allow conversations that exceed the max-\nimum input sequence length of the PLM to retain\nas much contextual information as possible when\nthey are fed into the PLM, we sequentially truncate\nthe last tokens of the maximum-length utterances\nof the conversation during preprocessing until the\nmaximum sequence length requirement of the PLM\nis met.

We conduct abla-\ntion studies to verify the effectiveness of differ-\nent modules in M3HG on the two datasets using 6\nAvg and 4 Avg scores. As shown in Table 6, w/o\nNe&Nc indicates no use of emotional and causal\ncontext nodes in graph construction. Consequently,\nemotion-cause pair prediction is performed directly\nbased on the features of each utterance node. w/o\ninter-fusion and w/o intra-fusion denote the ab-\nsence of inter-utterance and intra-utterance multi-\nmodal fusion, respectively, during multi-scale se-\nmantic information fusion. Our model outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art baselines even without utiliz-\ning the previous three mechanisms. Specifically,\nthe performance of M3HG degrades on both ECF\nand MECAD datasets when removing the emo-\ntional and causal context nodes, demonstrating the\nnecessity of explicitly modeling the emotion and\ncause-related contexts. Moreover, removing both\nintra-utterance and inter-utterance semantic fusion\nresults in a drop in the model\u2019s performance, the\nformer of which causes a more significant degrada-\ntion. It highlights the importance of effectively fus-\ning semantic information at different scales within\nheterogeneous graphs, particularly within individ-\nual utterances.\n\nTable 5: Performance comparison of different methods on four subtasks.

The performance of M3HG,\ncompared with two other representative models,\nis shown in Table 7.

For the EP subtask, M3HG per-\nforms the best across both datasets. It is worth\nnoting that GPT-4o (5-shots) achieves a high re-\ncall on the ECF dataset. This phenomenon can be\nattributed to the more pronounced label sparsity\nin the ECF dataset compared to MECAD. As a\nresult, GPT-4o (5-shots) frequently predicts that\nan utterance carries emotion, leading to a higher\nrecall. For the ER subtask, M3HG achieves the\nbest results across both datasets. This demonstrates\nM3HG\u2019s ability to effectively extract the emotional\ncontext embedded in utterances. For the CE sub-\ntask, M3HG performs best, demonstrating the im-\nportance of integrating the cause prediction subtask\ninto the model during training. For the EC subtask,\nGPT-4o (5-shots) similarly exhibits high recall on\nthe ECF dataset. This is due to the severe label\nsparsity problem in the ECF dataset, compared to\nMECAD, which leads GPT-4o to predict as many\nemotion-cause pairs as possible.\nE.3\nCase Study\nTo demonstrate the superiority and limitations of\nM3HG, we present a case study that compares the\nprediction results of M3HG with those of two other\nrepresentative models (i.e. SHARK, GPT-4o (5-\nshots)), using two sample conversations from the\nMECAD dataset. As shown in Figure 8, the first\ntest sample demonstrates that M3HG outperforms\nthe other models in prediction accuracy, while GPT-\n4o exhibits the poorest performance.\nThis can\nbe attributed to M3HG\u2019s use of a multimodal het-\nerogeneous graph and a specially designed con-\nversation super-node, which effectively captures\nglobal contextual information. These features en-\nable M3HG to more accurately handle scenarios\nwhere the cause utterance appears after the emotion\nutterance.\nIn the second sample, M3HG (T+A+V) is less\neffective than M3HG (T) in predicting Utterance\n6 as \u201cSad\u201d and Utterance 2 as \u201cNeutral\u201d. This is\nbecause the combination of text and context in Ut-\nterance 2 conveys the speaker\u2019s worried and fearful\nmood, while the video and audio signals suggest a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 8: An example of prompt for ChatGPT.\nInput\nInstruction\nYou are an expert in sentiment analysis and identification of emotional causes.

You are required to extract the utter-cause-emotion triplet for a given utterance.\nFirst, infer the emotion label for the utterance (select one from: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise\nor Neutral). Then, identify the index(es) of the cause utterance(s) that triggered this emotion (the index\nshould represent the utterance(s) from the conversation that caused the emotion, and it must be non-\nnegative. Multiple indices should be separated by commas). If the predicted emotion is Neutral, there is no\ncorresponding cause utterance. The output should follow the format: emotion label, cause utterance indices.\nExamples of the expected output format: Example 1: happy,3. Example 2: sad,3,4,5.

Second, both SFT\nand RL typically rely on high-quality, task-specific\ndatasets to achieve strong performance (Ouyang\net al., 2022). In ad headline generation, this re-\nquires diverse, high-quality headlines per content\ninstance, the creation of which is labor-intensive.\nTo address these challenges, we propose DIVER,\na novel optimizing framework that reformulates di-\nversified ad headline generation as a multi-stage,\nmulti-objective optimization task. This framework\nenables the model to generate multiple diverse yet\nhigh-quality headlines in a single forward pass. To\nachieve this goal, we first introduce a semantic and\nstylistic-aware data generation pipeline that auto-\nmatically produces high-quality and diverse paired\ndatasets. We then perform cold-start SFT on the\nsynthetic data to equip the model with basic capa-\nbilities for generating multiple candidate headlines.\nFinally, we design a multi-objective reward func-\ntion and apply reinforcement learning to optimize\nfor quality and diversity explicitly.\nOur main contributions are as follows:\n\u2022 We propose DIVER, a novel multi-stage multi-\nobjective optimization framework that gener-\nates diverse, high-quality ad headlines.\n\u2022 We develop an automatic data generation\npipeline that produces diverse, semantically\nand stylistically rich training examples.\n\u2022 We adopt a multi-stage training strategy with\ncold-start SFT and multi-objective RL to bal-\nance diversity and quality.\n\u2022 We deploy DIVER on the Explore Feed of\nXiaohongshu (a.k.a RedNote)1, a large-scale\ncontent-sharing platform, improving users\u2019 en-\ngagement and advertisers\u2019 satisfaction.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nAd Headline Generation\nAd headline generation is a longstanding core task\nin natural language generation (NLG) (Tevet and\nBerant, 2021). Early methods relied on handcrafted\ntemplates, rule-based heuristics, or retrieval ap-\nproaches (Bartz et al., 2008; Fujita et al., 2010;\nThomaidou et al., 2013), which produced generic\nand inflexible outputs.\nThe emergence of neu-\nral models, particularly sequence-to-sequence and\n1https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore.\nTransformer-based architectures (Xu et al., 2019;\nKanungo et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2025), has sub-\nstantially improved headline fluency and contex-\ntuality. Despite these advances, most methods re-\nmain centered on optimizing headline quality and\nCTR, neglecting the importance of diversity in out-\nputs. To address the limitations of conventional\napproaches, recent research has explored person-\nalization (Ao et al., 2023; Song et al., 2023; Tan\net al., 2024) by incorporating user preferences or\ncontextual signals to tailor outputs to individual\nusers. However, these personalized methods often\nfocus on specific audiences without systematically\nimproving headline diversity. Furthermore, the ab-\nsence of multi-reference datasets continues to hin-\nder the creation of varied ad content. To address\nthese limitations, we propose a multi-stage, multi-\nobjective framework with automatic data genera-\ntion to systematically enhance headline diversity.\n2.2\nLLMs for Diversity\nRecent advances in LLMs (Naveed et al., 2023;\nAchiam et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024) have signifi-\ncantly enhanced automatic text generation across a\nwide range of tasks, from headline generation (Lian\net al., 2025) to more open-ended creative writing\nand content creation (Mai and Carson-Berndsen,\n2024). To encourage diversity in generated texts,\nresearchers have explored various stochastic de-\ncoding strategies (Holtzman et al., 2020; Fan\net al., 2018) as well as prompt engineering tech-\nniques (Lau et al., 2024). However, while stochas-\ntic decoding can increase diversity, it often leads\nto uncontrollable outputs with compromised text\nquality and coherence. On the other hand, prompt\nengineering typically depends on pre-defined la-\nbels or templates, which inherently limit the flexi-\nbility and generalization of the models to new do-\nmains or tasks. More recently, researchers have\nbegun investigating diversity-driven training ob-\njectives (Mai and Carson-Berndsen, 2024) to ex-\nplicitly promote diversity during training, but the\ntrade-off between quality and diversity remains un-\nderexplored. Although methods such as SFT and\nRL on task-specific datasets can improve headline\nquality (Mai and Carson-Berndsen, 2024), they of-\nten produce deterministic outputs by overfitting to\ndominant patterns (Kirk et al., 2024), limiting diver-\nsity. To address these issues, our solution combines\nsynthetic data and multi-objective RL to jointly\noptimize diversity, quality, and CTR, generating\nhigh-quality headlines in a single pass.\n2\n\nStylistic Types\nSemantic Keywords\nDing ding\u2728 Here \nare my early \nautumn sweatshirt \noutfit ideas ( \u0300\u2304 \u0301) \nThe [Brand] \nMeow-Meow \nsweatshirt totally \ngets what girls \nwant!! \ud83d\udc08  Today\u2019s \nlook is also paired \nwith their new \nsneakers, \n[Brand]'s Sweet \nBun Shoes\nSemantic Keyword: Autumn Sweatshirts\nStylistic Type: Direct, Emoji, Statement\n[Label]: {\u201ctitle\u201d: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d}\n[Instruction]: You are a headline generation expert \u2026 Given \nthe <note content>, <semantic keyword>, and <stylistic type>, \nplease generate a suitable title for the note.\nLLMgen\nLLMSFT\nSynthetic Datasets\n[Label]: {\u201ctitle_1\u201d: <>, \n\u201ctitle_2\u201d: \u2026, \u201ctitle_3\u201d: \u2026}\n[Instruction]: You are a \nheadline generation expert \nspecializing in generating \ndiverse and appealing titles \nfor business posts. \n<note content>\nMulti-objective\nReward\nReward Models\nRM \ud835\udc93\ud835\udfcf\nRM \ud835\udc93\ud835\udfd0\nLLMSFT+RL\nFaithfulness Preference\nTitle Diversity Score\nRM \ud835\udc93\ud835\udfd3\nTitle Format Score\nBCE\nOnline \nServing\nRule\nRule\nlabel\nrewards\nsample\ncompletions\n\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\nTitles\nExtract\nExtract\nGenerate\nN times\nStage 1: Cold-start SFT (Sec. 3.1)\nStage 2: Multi-objective RL (Sec. 3.2)\nOutput\n{\n\u201ctitle 1\u201d: \u2026, \n\u201ctitle 2\u201d: \u2026,\n\u2026\u2026\n\u201ctitle N\u201d: \u2026\n}\nRollout\nInput\nParse\nSelect\nInput\ncurate\nOriginal Title\nAd Content\ncurate\n\u2728 [Brand] \nMeow-Meow \nsweatshirt\n6 Early Autumn\ud83c\udf42 \nSweatshirt Styles\nAutumn Is All \nAbout Comfort!!!\ud83e\udd79\nAffordable & Cute: \nPretty Fall Outfits\nThe 1st Result\nThe 2nd  Result\nThe Nth Result\n\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\nLLMSFT\n\u2026\nTitles\ntitle 1\n\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\ntitle 2\ntitle 3\ntitle N\nmean\nFigure 2: Overview of the DIVER framework. Our approach first performs synthetic data-augmented SFT to enable\nbasic diversity in headline generation. This is followed by multi-objective RL to further enhance the diversity and\nquality of generated headlines through a composite reward function.\n3\nMethod\nWe introduce DIVER for generating diverse ad\nheadlines, as illustrated in Figure 2.\nDIVER\nemploys a multi-stage multi-objective training\npipeline consisting of (1) synthetic data-augmented\nfine-tuning for cold-start SFT (Section 3.1), and (2)\nmulti-objective reinforcement learning for enhanc-\ning quality and diversity (Section 3.2).\n3.1\nSynthetic Data for Cold-start SFT\nCreating datasets with multiple diverse headlines\nfor each ad content is labor-intensive. To address\nthis, we propose a data generation pipeline that\nleverages LLMs to synthesize training samples for\ncold-start supervised fine-tuning.\nSemantic- and Stylistic-aware Data Enrichment.\nGiven an industrial dataset D consisting of origi-\nnal headlines and their corresponding ad content,\nwe first employ open source LLMs to annotate\neach headline with its semantic keyword and stylis-\ntic type2, resulting in a dataset D\u2032 composed of\nquadruples in the format \u27e8ad content, semantic key-\nword, stylistic type, headline\u27e9. We then fine-tune a\ngenerator \u03c0\u03b8gen with \u27e8ad content, semantic keyword,\nstylistic type\u27e9as input and headline as the target\nlabel, enabling it to generate headlines conditioned\non both semantic and stylistic cues.\n2Throughout the paper, we define an ad headline style\nalong three dimensions: directness (direct vs. indirect), emoji\nusage (with emoji vs. without emoji), and rhetorical type\n(question, exaggeration, metaphor, or statement). Combining\nthese dimensions yields a total of 16 distinct headline styles.\nControlled Diverse Headline Generation.\nFor\neach ad content, we prompt an LLM to gener-\nate multiple semantically distinct keywords con-\nditioned on the ad content, each paired with a ran-\ndomly selected stylistic type. These semantic key-\nwords and style pairs, combined with the ad con-\ntent, are fed into \u03c0\u03b8gen to produce diverse headline\nsets in both meaning and tone. Finally, we further\nperform an LLM-based verification step to ensure\nthat each generated headline covers the required se-\nmantic keywords and matches the assigned stylistic\ntype. Only headlines that pass this verification are\nretained for subsequent training.\nDataset Construction and Training.\nThe syn-\nthetic dataset consists of ad content as input and\na set of multiple headlines as output, structured\nin a consistent template format, as illustrated in\nFigure 2. During cold-start SFT, we input ad con-\ntent into \u03c0\u03b8sft and train it to generate multiple di-\nverse headlines in a structured format, allowing\nthe model to produce semantically and stylistically\nvaried outputs in a single pass.\n3.2\nMulti-objective Reinforcement Learning\nWhile SFT with synthetic data can encourage ba-\nsic diversity, supervised learning alone often leads\nto repetitive outputs and mediocre phrasing (Kirk\net al., 2024). To overcome this, we adopt multi-\nobjective reinforcement learning with a tailored\nreward function, a widely used approach for balanc-\ning and optimizing multiple competing objectives\nin RLHF (Wu et al., 2023; Dai et al., 2024).\n3\n\n\nrf |\n\n\n\n\niim\nec\n\n\n\u00ab\n\nS\nS\n\n3.2.1\nReward Design\nWe design fine-grained reward functions to guide\nthe model in generating diverse, faithful, and en-\ngaging headlines, with the overall reward averaged\nacross five components. Further details on the re-\nward function design and reward model training\nare provided in Appendix A.\nDiversity Reward.\nThis reward combines seman-\ntic and stylistic diversity. Semantic diversity is mea-\nsured as the complement of the average pairwise\nBLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002), while stylistic\ndiversity reflects the coverage of predefined style\ntypes. The overall reward is computed as:\nrdiversity = 1 \u2212Pair-BLEU(Y ) + Coverage(Y )\n2\n,\nwhere Y = {y1, . . . , yN} is the set of generated\nheadlines.\nQuality Reward.\nWe evaluate the quality of each\nheadline in terms of faithfulness to the input docu-\nment, using a fine-tuned model that outputs a faith-\nfulness score between 0 and 1. The reward reflects\nthe proportion of headlines that meet or exceed a\ngiven faithfulness threshold.\nCTR Reward.\nTo reflect user satisfaction, we\nuse a CTR prediction model trained on historical\nuser interaction logs to score each generated head-\nline. The user preference reward is the average\nCTR score across all generated headlines.\nQuantity Reward.\nThis reward encourages the\nmodel to output the predefined number of head-\nlines by explicitly comparing the actual count with\nthe specified target number. The reward grows lin-\nearly with the number of generated headlines and\nsaturates when the target number is reached.\nFormat Reward.\nThis reward is higher if the\nmodel is able to generate the headlines in a correct\nand easily parsed JSON format, making it straight-\nforward and efficient to extract each headline.\n3.2.2\nRL Optimization\nWe formulate headline generation as a policy learn-\ning task, where the model \u03c0\u03b8 generates N head-\nlines per content x in a single pass, producing out-\nputs Y = {y1, . . . , yN}. During RL optimization,\nwe repeatedly sample headline sets, compute the\ncomposite reward, and update the model using the\nGRPO algorithm (Shao et al., 2024):\nmax\n\u03b8\nEx\u223cD, Y \u223c\u03c0\u03b8(\u00b7|x) [R(x, Y )]\u2212\u03b2DKL (\u03c0\u03b8\u2225\u03c0\u03b8sft) ,\nwhere R(x, Y ) denotes the composite reward for\nthe generated set Y , \u03b2 controls the strength of the\nKL penalty, and \u03c0\u03b8sft is the reference model.\nDuring inference, each input advertising content\nis passed through \u03c0\u03b8 to generate a set of headlines\nfor online serving.\n4\nExperiments\n4.1\nExperimental Setup\nDatasets.\nTo our knowledge, no publicly avail-\nable large-scale dataset exists specifically for the\nadvertising domain. Therefore, we constructed an\nindustrial dataset by collecting commercial ad logs\nfrom a leading content-sharing platform for both\ntraining and evaluation. Further details regarding\ndataset statistics, construction, and preprocessing\ncan be found in Appendix B.\nBaselines.\nWe chose Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct as\na base model (Qwen, 2025) to conduct SFT and\nRL training and generate multiple ad headlines.\nAdditional experimental settings are provided in\nAppendix C. To comprehensively evaluate our ap-\nproach, we compared it against two categories\nof baselines.\nFirst, we include state-of-the-art\nopen-source and proprietary models, such as GPT-\n4o (OpenAI, 2024), Claude-3.5-Sonnet (Anthropic,\n2024), DeepSeek-V3 (DeepSeek-AI, 2025), and\nQwen2.5-72B-Instruct (Qwen, 2025). Second, we\nconsider fine-tuning-based methods, including Pos-\nsibility Exploration Fine-Tuning (PEFT) (Mai and\nCarson-Berndsen, 2024), applied to our gener-\nated dataset. All models were tested on the same\ndatasets under controlled settings.\nEvaluation Metrics.\nWe adopt a dual-aspect\nevaluation framework that considers both diversity\nand quality. To assess diversity, we measure both\nlexical and semantic variation among generated ti-\ntles using Pairwise BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002),\nSelf-BLEU (Zhu et al., 2018), Distinct N-Gram (Li\net al., 2015), and Cosine Similarity (Salton and\nMcGill, 1986)3. We evaluate style diversity via\nStyle Coverages. For quality, we assess both faith-\nfulness and content relevance of the headlines using\nNLI-based evaluation (Yoran et al., 2023)4, Rouge-\n1, Rouge-2, and Rouge-L (Chin-Yew, 2004).\n3CosSim is computed using Sentence-BERT at: https:\n//huggingface.co/uer/sbert-base-chinese-nli\n4NLI-based evaluation is performed with mDeBERTa-\nv3-base\nat:\nhttps://huggingface.co/MoritzLaurer/\nmDeBERTa-v3-base-xnli-multilingual-nli-2mil7.\n4\n\nMethod\nDiversity\nQuality\nPairBLEU \u2193\nSelfBLEU \u2193\nDisNGram \u2191\nCosSim \u2193\nStyleCov \u2191\nNLI \u2191\nRouge-1 \u2191\nRouge-2 \u2191\nRouge-L \u2191\nBase: Closed-source Models\nGPT-4o\n10.46\n40.97\n47.39\n50.57\n50.73%\n70.48\n16.19\n4.71\n9.91\nClaude-3.5\n8.21\n43.89\n53.02\n47.46\n45.63%\n75.73\n14.29\n3.89\n8.69\nBase: Open-source Models\nQwen2.5-72B\n21.41\n55.02\n47.62\n78.00\n39.26%\n72.95\n17.93\n6.05\n10.87\nDeepSeek V3\n20.91\n53.37\n43.50\n54.88\n42.78%\n83.83\n17.14\n5.29\n10.64\nBase: Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct\nPEFT\n5.71\n47.89\n38.43\n42.16\n60.20%\n75.65\n17.28\n6.93\n11.22\nDIVER\n2.08\n35.93\n52.92\n28.93\n63.42%\n76.72\n16.71\n7.30\n10.91\nTable 1: Performance comparison of baseline models and our method.

Subscripts show differences compared with DIVER, with red indicating worse\nand green indicating better performance.\n4.2\nMain Results\nAs shown in Table 1, DIVER demonstrates supe-\nrior performance over other methods across most\ndiversity metrics. Specifically, it achieves the low-\nest scores for both Pairwise-BLEU and Self-BLEU,\nindicating minimal redundancy among generated\ntitles, and covers the largest proportion of target\nstyles. Meanwhile, our approach maintains a high\nquality score that is on par with advanced base-\nlines such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet and DeepSeek V3.\nCompared to prompting and fine-tuning strategies,\nDIVER consistently produces ad headlines that are\nmore diverse and stylistically rich while remaining\nfaithful to the original content. These findings un-\nderscore the capability of our approach to produce\nad headlines that balance diversity and quality.\n4.3\nAblation Studies\nTo evaluate the contribution of each component\nin our framework, we perform ablation studies by\nselectively removing the semantic- and stylistic-\naware data augmentation pipeline (w/o Data), the\nmulti-objective reinforcement learning phase (w/o\nRL), or both (w/o Both). As shown in Table 2,\nremoving either the augmented data or the RL stage\nleads to noticeable declines in both diversity and\nfaithfulness. Excluding both components leads to\nthe weakest performance, while DIVER achieves\nthe best balance of diversity and quality, with the\nhighest quality score, broadest style coverage, and\nlowest redundancy, highlighting the value of data\naugmentation and RL optimization.\n4.4\nAnalysis of Multi-objective RL\nWe further analyze the effectiveness of each reward\nfunction within the multi-objective RL. As shown\nin Table 2, removing the diversity reward (w/o Di-\nversity) leads to a significant decrease in all diver-\nsity metrics, while minimal improvement in head-\nline quality, indicating its key role in promoting\noutput variety.

Removing CTR, quan-\ntity, or format rewards leads to declines in style\ncoverage, diversity, or overall performance, indi-\ncating that all components are vital for balancing\ndiversity and quality.\n4.5\nOnline Case Study\nTable 3 shows diverse ad headlines generated by\nDIVER. For each advertisement, the model gener-\nates multiple candidate titles that cover different\nexpressions or emphases, reflecting varied user per-\nspectives (e.g., male or female) and interests (e.g.,\nfunctional vs. aesthetic appeal, practical tips vs.\nemotional resonance). This demonstrates its ability\nto produce a wide range of high-quality and diverse\nad headlines for online personalization.\n4.6\nOnline A/B Test\nWe have deployed DIVER on the Explore Feed of\nXiaohongshu, a large-scale content sharing plat-\nform, where advertising performance is primarily\nmeasured by advertiser value (ADVV) (Chai et al.,\n2025; Timmaraju et al., 2023) and click-through\nrate (CTR). During online serving, we first generate\n30 ad headlines with DIVER. To enable personal-\nization, we select the headline most semantically\nsimilar to the user profile. Online A/B testing re-\nsults, as shown in Table 4, demonstrate the practi-\ncal effectiveness of DIVER. Specifically, models\nusing high-temperature sampling and SFT with-\nout synthetic data achieve moderate improvements\nover the base model in both ADVV (+2.2%) and\nCTR (+0.7%). DIVER, combining synthetic data,\ncold-start SFT, and multi-objective RL, achieves\na further boost, with ADVV increasing by 4.0%\nand CTR by 1.4%. These results show that our ap-\nproach enhances both headline quality and diversity\nwhile delivering business impact.\n5\nConclusion\nThis paper addresses the challenge of generating\nad headlines that are both high-quality and diverse,\nwhich is crucial for attracting and engaging var-\nious user segments. By introducing a semantic-\nand stylistic-aware data generation pipeline and\na multi-stage, multi-objective optimization frame-\nwork combining SFT and RL, our method effec-\ntively balances diversity and quality. We have suc-\ncessfully deployed DIVER on a large-scale content-\nsharing platform, achieving significant gains in\ncore metrics for the advertising system.\n6\n\nLimitations\nAlthough DIVER performs well in generating di-\nverse, high-quality ad headlines, several limitations\nremain. Synthetic data may introduce noise or\nstylistic bias, limiting personalization and gener-\nalization. Diversity in long-tail categories suffers\nfrom data scarcity, and fixed reward metrics may\noverlook nuanced user preferences. Deployment\nalso faces challenges in latency, scalability, and\nadapting to user trends. Future work will focus\non enriching long-tail data, incorporating richer\nsignals, and adopting more adaptive rewards to im-\nprove practical effectiveness.\nEthical Considerations\nAll datasets used in this study used are properly\nlicensed and contain no private or sensitive user\ninformation. Generated ad headlines require adver-\ntiser approval before use, and we apply rigorous\npost-processing, including quality control and risk\nassessment, prior to online deployment. An online\nblacklist system further ensures rapid removal of\nany problematic content. These measures collec-\ntively safeguard user privacy, content integrity, and\nplatform safety throughout our framework.\nReferences\nJosh Achiam, Steven Adler, Sandhini Agarwal, Lama\nAhmad, Ilge Akkaya, Florencia Leoni Aleman,\nDiogo Almeida, Janko Altenschmidt, Sam Altman,\nShyamal Anadkat, et al. 2023.

For the diversity reward, seman-\ntic diversity is computed as the average pairwise\nBLEU score within the generated set, i.e,\nPair-BLEU(Y ) = 1\nZ\nN\nX\ni=1\nN\nX\nj=1\ni\u0338=j\nBLEU(yi, yj) ,\nwhere Z = N \u00b7 (N \u22121).\nStyle diversity is\nmeasured by the proportion of distinct style cat-\negories presents in the generated headlines, where\nwe prompt DeepSeek-V3 to classify the style of\nthe headline. The quantity reward encourages gen-\nerating at least T headlines, defined as rquantity =\nmin(1, N/T). The format reward is 1 if the output\nis valid JSON; otherwise, it is 0.\nDetails about Quality Reward.\nTo promote\nhigh-quality headline generation, we use a human-\nlabeled quality reward. Headlines sampled via\nhigh-temperature SFT are labeled as high-quality\n(1) or not (0) and used to train a binary classifier\nfquality(\u00b7) with content and headline as input, op-\ntimized using binary cross-entropy. The quality\nreward during RL is the average predicted score\nacross all headline-content pairs.\nDetails about CTR Reward.\nTo optimize user\nsatisfaction, we train a CTR-based reward model\nusing online interaction logs. For each 10,000\nnotes, multiple headlines are generated via high-\ntemperature SFT, and user interaction data is used\nto label the top and bottom third of headlines by\nCTR as positive and negative samples. This yields\n40,000 headline pairs to train a CTR prediction\nmodel fCTR(h, x) with headline h and content x as\ninput and optimize with a pairwise margin loss:\nL = 1\nN\nN\nX\ni=1\nmax(0, 0.3 \u2212s+\ni + s\u2212\ni ) ,\nwhere N represents the batch size, s+\ni\n=\nfCTR(h+\ni , xi) and h+\ni is the positive headline for\nthe content xi. s\u2212\ni = fCTR(h\u2212\ni , xi) represents the\npredicted score for the negative headline. All user\ndata is anonymized. During RL training, the CTR\nreward is the average predicted score across all\ngenerated headline and content pairs.\nB\nDataset Construction and Processing\nThis section introduces the dataset used for our ad\nheadline generation task.\nRaw Data.\nOur dataset comprises commercial\nad notes from a major content-sharing platform in\nChina. To ensure privacy and compliance, all per-\nsonal information was anonymized. Each instance\nincludes the original title, content, topics, caption,\nand taxonomy, offering key semantic and stylistic\ncues for headline generation.\nPreprocessing.\nTo ensure data quality and repre-\nsentativeness, we prioritized titles with high CTR\nwhile filtering out those with inflated CTR due to\nexcessive exposure. We also balanced category dis-\ntribution, removed duplicate or near-duplicate ads\nbased on string similarity, and cleaned records with\nmissing fields, repetition, or encoding errors.\nSplit and Statistics.\nThe dataset was chronologi-\ncally split into training and test sets to reflect real-\nworld usage. Table 5 presents key statistics. This\ndataset provides a high-quality benchmark for train-\ning and evaluating ad headline generation models.\nSubset\nNumber of Instances\nSFT training set\n50,000\nRL training set\n79,334\nTest set\n3,000\nTable 5: Dataset Statistics\nC\nExperimental Setups\nWe selected Qwen2.5-14B (Qwen, 2025) as the\nbase model for experiments, and conducted training\non a single server with 8 NVIDIA H800 GPUs.\nSupervised Fine-tuning.\nThe model was fine-\ntuned for 3 epochs on 50,000 samples, using a\nmaximum input length of 6,000 tokens, a learning\nrate 1 \u00d7 10\u22125, and bf16 precision.\nReinforcement Learning.\nWe used the GRPO\nalgorithm (Shao et al., 2024) with full-parameter\nfine-tuning. RL training was performed on 79,334\nsamples, with an input cutoff of 4,096 tokens, a\nlearning rate of 3 \u00d7 10\u22126, and bf16 precision.\nD\nDetailed Prompts\nThe key prompts used for data enrichment and data\nconstruction are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4.\n9\n\nTitle Keyword and Style Extraction: \n\u4f60\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u9898\u5206\u6790\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u64c5\u957f\u4ece\u5546\u4e1a\u7b14\u8bb0\u6807\u9898\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6700\u80fd\u4ee3\u8868\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\n\u5224\u65ad\u6807\u9898\u7684\u98ce\u683c\uff1a\n1. \u76f4\u89c2\u6027\uff08\u76f4\u63a5\u578b/\u95f4\u63a5\u578b\uff09\n2.

Kojima et al. [12] demonstrated that LLMs are not only\ncapable of generating effective responses, but also show intrinsic\nreasoning abilities when prompted using the zero shot technique.\nSimilarly, Few-Shot prompting involves offering the model a small,\nexplicitly defined set of examples within the prompt, guiding the\nmodel\u2019s understanding, and improving output accuracy and rea-\nsoning capabilities [3]. To further enhance the capabilities of LLMs,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as an effec-\ntive extension to traditional prompting techniques. RAG combines\nretrieval systems with generative language models, enabling the\nmodels to access external knowledge sources dynamically during\nresponse generation [13].\nThis technological leap serves as the bedrock for rapidly emerg-\ning field of agentic AI, representing a significant paradigm shift\ntowards autonomous systems. Unlike earlier AI applications, these\nagents are designed not just to respond or generate, but to rea-\nson, plan, retrieve information, utilize tools, and execute complex,\nmulti-step tasks to achieve specific goals autonomously. However,\nas agentic AI systems increasingly rely on LLMs and external infor-\nmation sources to inform their reasoning and actions, they inherit\nand often amplify their critical vulnerability: bias [1]. Bias refers to\nthe consistent imbalance and unjust representation that arises from\nresponses derived from sources that disproportionately privilege or\ndisadvantage specific groups, often mirroring historical or societal\ninequalities. LLMs are known to capture and reflect the societal\nbiases present in their vast training dataset leading to output that\ncan perpetuate stereotypes related to gender, race, ethnicity, politi-\ncal leaning, and other characteristics [6]. Furthermore, the external\nknowledge that the agents utilize is itself not neutral. News articles,\nand other online documents frequently contain skewed perspec-\ntives, misinformation, or systemic biases [15]. This propagation of\nbias directly undermines user trust, compromises system reliability,\nand poses significant risks of generating harmful or inequitable\noutcomes [7].\nWhile various techniques exist for mitigating bias within the\nLLMs themselves such as Zhang et al. [26] presents a model-level\ndebiasing technique using preference optimization algorithm and\na debiased preference dataset to address modality bias, where the\nmodel over-relies on one modality. These methods often fall short\nin the dynamic context of Agentic AI workflows. Now a days, the\nchallenge is to actively managing the bias ingested from constantly\nchanging external sources during task execution. Existing agent\nframeworks often prioritize task completion and information rele-\nvance, latency over robust and integrated mechanisms to evaluate\narXiv:2508.18724v1  [cs.AI]  26 Aug 2025\n\nKDD\u201925, August 03-07, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada\nKaranbir Singh, Deepak Muppiri, and William Ngu\nand mitigate the bias. This gap highlights a critical need for novel\napproaches that address bias directly at the point of information\nretrieval within agentic architectures.\nTo address this gap, we introduce the Bias Mitigation Agent,\na novel multi-agent framework specifically designed to operate\nwithin Agentic AI workflows. Our approach automates the bias mit-\nigation process by optimizing the selection of potential information\nsources prior to ingestion. We propose two techniques for source\nselection: a zero-shot approach and a few-shot approach, both\ndesigned to dynamically assess and mitigate bias during agent oper-\nation, thus enhancing fairness, reliability, and overall system trust-\nworthiness. Our results show that this bias reduction is achieved\nwithout a corresponding loss in information relevance, showcasing\nthe potential of our approach to promote the development of more\nresponsible, trustworthy, and equitable Agentic AI systems.\nThe rest of the paper details the related work and architecture of\nthe Bias Mitigation Agent. Also, we present results of comprehen-\nsive experiments designed to validate its effectiveness, demonstrat-\ning significant quantitative improvements in retrieving unbiased\ndocuments across various scenarios compared to baseline agentic\nretrieval.\n2\nRelated Work\nIn this section, we discuss the existing work that was done to\nidentify and mitigate bias from AI driven systems. These tech-\nniques can be categorized based on the stage of the AI lifecycle at\nwhich they are implemented: pre-processing, in-processing, and\npost-processing. In addition to these traditional categories, we also\ninclude prompt and agentic bias mitigation approaches to capture\nemerging work that leverages prompt engineering and autonomous\nagents to address bias.\n2.1\nPre-processing techniques\nPre-processing techniques aim to mitigate biases within datasets\nbefore they are used for training models, thereby reducing the risk\nof perpetuating systemic unfairness and thus inherently produc-\ning fair models. Kamiran and Calders [10] proposed three data\npreprocessing techniques: Massaging, Reweighting, and Sampling\nto address discrimination and mitigate bias in classification tasks.\nDe-Arteaga et al. [5]removed gender-related words from a set of bi-\nographies which resulted in significant improvement in the fairness\nof a classifier used to predict corresponding occupations. Raza et al.\n[16] introduced Dbias, an open-source Python package designed\nto detect and mitigate biases in news articles. Dbias pipeline is\nmade up of three core modules: bias detection, bias recognition,\nand de-biasing. The pipeline ensures that pre-processed data is free\nof bias, resulting in fairer models during training.\n2.2\nIn-processing techniques\nWhile pre-processing techniques focus on data preparation, in-\nprocessing approaches tackle bias directly during model training\nor inference. The idea is to penalize the model if it favors bias and\nhence it controls the loss function to minimize bias. For example,\nRekabsaz et al. [17] develop AdvBert, a BERT based ranking model\nthat uses adversarial training to simultaneously predict relevance\nand suppress protected attributes in content retrieved by IR sys-\ntems. Jaenich et al. [9] modify the ranking process using policies\nto ensure that different document categories are ranked fairly and\nhence improving fairness metrics by 13% in IR systems. Singh and\nJoachims [18] propose a generic fairness-aware learning-to-rank\n(LTR) framework using a policy-gradient method to enforce fair-\nness constraints within a listwise LTR setting. Building on this,\nZehlike and Castillo [25] integrate fairness into listwise LTR by in-\ncorporating a regularization term into the model\u2019s utility objective.\n2.3\nPost processing techniques\nPost processing introduces fairness after the model or ranking\noutput is generated. Yang and Stoyanovich [23] proposed fairness\nmeasures for ranked outputs and incorporated these measures into\nan optimization framework to improve fairness while maintaining\naccuracy. Zehlike et al. [24] introduced FA*IR, a post-processing\nalgorithm to ensure group fairness in the retrieved documents by\nguaranteeing a minimum proportion of protected candidates while\nmaximizing utility in IR systems.\n2.4\nPrompting techniques\nThe way users interact with LLMs, and the instructions given to\nthe model, can significantly influence bias expression. Prompt engi-\nneering techniques aim to guide the model towards fairer outputs\nby providing specific instructions (e.g., \"avoid stereotypes,\" \"provide\nbalanced views\"), setting context, or using role-playing prompts. Ma\net al. [14] proposed a novel search strategy based on greedy search\nto identify the near-optimal prompt to improve the performance of\nLLM\u2019s. Kamruzzaman and Kim [11] explores prompting techniques\ninspired by dual process theory to reduce social biases in LLM\u2019s,\ntechniques such as human and machine like personals, explicit\ndebiasing instructions and chain of though prompting are used to\ninfluence the model output to reduce stereotypical responses.\n2.5\nAgentic mitigation techniques\nThe autonomy and interactive nature of Agentic AI require specific\nmitigation approaches. Given agents\u2019 reliance on external informa-\ntion, strategies focusing on bias-aware information retrieval and\nsource selection are crucial. This can involve integrating bias de-\ntectors as tools within the agent\u2019s framework to evaluate potential\nsources before using the information [19]. Borah and Mihalcea [2]\nproposes a multi-agent approach, where a metric is developed to\nassess the presence of bias and then self-reflection and supervised\nfine-tuning strategies are employed to mitigate bias. Xu et al. [22]\ntackles bias mitigation using a multi-objective approach within a\nmulti-agent framework(MOMA) to mitigate bias. Multiple agents\nare deployed and perform interventions on the bias-related contents\nof the query.\nThe approach we present uses agentic mitigation techniques,\nwhere multiple agents, such as knowledge, bias detector, source\nselector, and writer, interact and perform specific tasks to miti-\ngate bias in the output provided to the user without degrading\nperformance.\n\nBias Mitigation Agent: Optimizing Source Selection for Fair and Balanced Knowledge Retrieval\nKDD\u201925, August 03-07, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada\nFigure 1: Architecture of a Supervisor-Based Multi-Agent System for Bias Mitigation. The diagram depicts the life cycle of the\nagent from user\u2019s query to final answer coordinated by the manager agent. The Knowledge Agent retrieves documents, the Bias\nDetection Agent evaluates retrieved documents for bias, and the Source Selector Agent chooses the optimal unbiased sources.\nFinally, the Writer Agent synthesizes a coherent, unbiased answer, which is presented back to the user.\n3\nApproach\nThis section outlines the architecture and operational design of the\nBias Mitigation Framework, a multi-agent system constructed using\nLangGraph [8] which supports stateful workflows to manage inter-\nagent communication and control flow. The framework is designed\nto enhance fairness and transparency in knowledge-retrieval tasks\nby orchestrating a set of specialized agents through a centralized\ncontrol mechanism.\nAt its core, the system consists of a Manager Agent (\ud835\udc40), a set\nof Worker Agents (\ud835\udc4a), and a shared state of the system (S). Each\nworker agent \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56\u2208\ud835\udc4ais responsible for a specific task such as doc-\nument retrieval, bias detection, source selection, etc. The Manager\nAgent supervises the execution flow, maintains system state, and\ncoordinates decisions based on intermediate outcomes.\nThe framework supports three operational modes, enabling dif-\nferent strategies for source selection:\n\u2022 No Source Selection: In this baseline mode, the system\nretrieves the most relevant document on the basis of vector\nsimilarity to the user query. The document is then passed to\nthe writer agent without performing any source selection.\n\u2022 Zero-Shot: In this mode, the system retrieves multiple can-\ndidate documents and evaluates them based on relevance\nand bias. The source selector agent makes a decision based\nsolely on these metrics using its parametric knowledge and\nreasoning capability. This mode provides a lightweight fair-\nness mechanism without requiring any kind of in-context\nlearning.\n\u2022 Few-Shot: This advanced mode leverages labeled examples\nto guide the source selector agent in making informed de-\ncisions. It combines bias and relevance scores with prior\ndemonstrations to achieve more consistent and nuanced se-\nlections, especially in domains with subjective or ambiguous\ncontent.\nBy supporting these three modes, the framework enables flexible\ntrade-offs between computational efficiency, fairness enforcement,\nand generalization capability. In the next subsections, the internal\nstate, behavior of the Manager Agent, and the specialized functions\nof the Worker Agents are defined.\n3.1\nState\nThe framework maintains an internal state to facilitate structured\ndecision-making between agents. This state captures the evolving\nsystem context, supports transitions, enforces retry logic, and im-\nplements guardrails to ensure that the final user response is both\nrelevant and fair. We define the state S as a tuple, as presented in\nEquation 1:\nS = (C, \ud835\udefc,\ud835\udf05, \ud835\udf07, \ud835\udf1a)\n(1)\n\n\nKDD\u201925, August 03-07, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada\nKaranbir Singh, Deepak Muppiri, and William Ngu\nwhere:\n\u2022 C = {\ud835\udc501,\ud835\udc502, . . . ,\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b} \u2286D is the set of candidate documents\nretrieved from the vector store, where D represents the\ncomplete corpus of documents.\n\u2022 \ud835\udefc\u2208C denotes the document selected for final answer gen-\neration.\n\u2022 \ud835\udf05\u2208N is the current retry attempt.\n\u2022 \ud835\udf07\u2208N specifies the maximum number of retries allowed.\n\u2022 \ud835\udf1a\u2208S captures the most recent rejection reason (e.g., all\ncandidates rejected due to bias or low relevance).\nEach document \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\u2208D is further modeled as a tuple, as defined\nin Equation 2:\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56= (\ud835\udf12, \ud835\udf0c, \ud835\udefd,\ud835\udefe)\n(2)\nwhere:\n\u2022 \ud835\udf12is the textual content of the document.\n\u2022 \ud835\udf0c\u2208[0, 1] is the relevance score with respect to the user\nquery.\n\u2022 \ud835\udefd\u2208[0, 1] is the bias confidence score, which represents the\nsystem\u2019s confidence in its bias assessment.\n\u2022 \ud835\udefe\u2208{0, 1} is a binary label that indicates whether the docu-\nment is biased (\ud835\udefe= 1) or unbiased (\ud835\udefe= 0).\nThis formalism enables the framework to track a comprehensive\nand interpretable state across multiple agent interactions and adapt\nthe retrieval process in response to fairness constraints.\n3.2\nManager Agent\n<System Prompt with source selection>\nYou are a Supervisor Agent responsible for coordinating\nmultiple specialized agents in a multi-agent system.

It is responsible for maintaining the current state of the\nsystem, directing the sequence of agent invocations, and enforcing\nretry policies in the event of retrieval/selection failures. The agent\nis guided by system-level prompts, which vary depending on the\nexecution mode. These prompts are illustrated in Figures 2 and 3.\n<System Prompt without source selection>\nYou are a Supervisor Agent responsible for coordinating\nmultiple specialized agents in a multi-agent system.

Unlike the Manager Agent, which controls the\norchestration and high-level control flow, these agents focus on\nspecific tasks. The framework consists of the following worker\nagents:\n3.3.1\nKnowledge Agent. This agent is implemented as a tool-calling\nagent that interfaces with ChromaDB [4], which acts as a retriever.\nIts primary responsibility is to fetch the top-\ud835\udc58documents from\nthe corpus based on vector similarity to the user query \ud835\udc5e. The\nagent operates differently depending on whether source selection\nis enabled.\nIn case of no source selection mode, the agent retrieves a single\ndocument \ud835\udc51\u2208D that maximizes relevance and is automatically\nchosen as the selected source \ud835\udefcwithout using any sophisticated\nprocess to mitigate bias, reflecting the typical behavior of the cur-\nrent LLM-based information retrieval systems in production as\npresented in the following equation 3:\n\ud835\udefc= \ud835\udc51= arg max\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\u2208D \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc56\n(3)\nHere, \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc56denotes the relevance score of the document \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56.\nWhen source selection is enabled, the agent retrieves a set of\ncandidate documents C \u2286D to allow downstream agents to assess\nboth relevance and bias. If all candidate documents \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\u2208C are\nrejected due to high bias or low relevance, then the system retries\nto retrieve ideal candidates C. In the retry phase, the agent per-\nforms query expansion, transforming the original query \ud835\udc5einto an\nimproved query \ud835\udc5e\u2032 based on the rejection reason \ud835\udf1a. The new query\n\ud835\udc5e\u2032 is embedded as \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc5e\u2032, and a new set of candidate documents is se-\nlected. The resulting set of candidates is passed on to downstream\nagents for further evaluation.\n3.3.2\nBias Detection Agent. This Agent is responsible for evalu-\nating the presence and severity of bias at the source level. When\nsource selection is enabled, the manager forwards the candidate set\nC retrieved by the knowledge agent to the agent. Each candidate\n\nBias Mitigation Agent: Optimizing Source Selection for Fair and Balanced Knowledge Retrieval\nKDD\u201925, August 03-07, 2025, Toronto, ON, Canada\ndocument \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\u2208C is then analyzed using a pre-trained text classifi-\ncation model called Dbias [16]. For each candidate document, the\nagent assigns the following:\n\u2022 A bias confidence score (\ud835\udefd\ud835\udc56\u2208[0, 1]), which quantifies the\nsystem confidence in the detected bias.\n\u2022 A binary label (\ud835\udefe\ud835\udc56\u2208{0, 1}), where \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc56= 1 indicates that the\ndocument is biased, and \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc56= 0 indicates that it is unbiased.\nThese values are then used to update the current state S. In the\ncase of no source selection mode, the agent operates on the selected\ndocument \ud835\udefc, applying the same analysis pipeline. This ensures that\neven in the absence of comparative selection, the system retains\nawareness of potential bias in the final chosen source.\n3.3.3\nSource Selection Agent. The agent is responsible for iden-\ntifying the most suitable document from the candidate set C by\nevaluating both the relevance and the bias metrics. This agent is\ninvoked only when the system operates in modes that enable source\nselection, specifically zero-shot and few-shot.\nZero Shot. In this mode, the agent applies a rule-based selection\nstrategy and uses the parametric knowledge and reasoning ability\nof the underlying model to select a suitable source \ud835\udefcto answer the\nuser\u2019s query \ud835\udc5e. During the first attempt, it adheres to strict selection\ncriteria as defined in equation 4 where only documents with \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc56= 0\n(unbiased) and \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc56\u22650.7 (high confidence in the determination) are\nconsidered. Among these, the document with the highest relevance\nscore \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc56is selected.\n\ud835\udefc= arg max\n\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\u2208C\u2032 \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc56,\nwhere C\u2032 = {\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\u2208C | \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc56= 0 \u2227\ud835\udefd\ud835\udc56\u22650.7}\n(4)\nIf no candidate meets the selection criteria, the agent updates the\ncurrent state S with the rejection reason \ud835\udf1aand the entire retrieval\nand selection process is executed again by the manager agent. If the\nsystem reaches its final attempt, the agent applies relaxed selection\nrules. This allows the system to still generate an answer even under\nconstrained document conditions.\nFew Shot. In this mode, the agent uses in-context examples to\nguide its decision making. It is provided with a set of labeled in-\nstances that illustrate how to select the optimal document based on\ncombinations of (\ud835\udefd\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udefe\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc56) values. These examples encode decision\npatterns that help the agent generalize the source selection logic\nbeyond simple thresholding mechanisms.\nGiven a set of candidates C, the agent evaluates each candidate\n\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56based on its similarity to previous examples and selects the most\nappropriate document that meets the dual criteria of high relevance\nand minimal bias. Formally:\n\ud835\udefc= arg max\n\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\u2208C \ud835\udc53few-shot(\ud835\udefd\ud835\udc56,\ud835\udefe\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udf0c\ud835\udc56)\n(5)\nwhere \ud835\udc53few-shot is a learned or example-conditioned scoring func-\ntion implicitly encoded via prompt demonstrations.\nSimilarly to the zero-shot mode, if no candidate meets the selec-\ntion criteria, then the system attempts to retry and pick the suitable\ncandidate as the selected source \ud835\udefc.\n3.3.4\nWriter Agent. The agent is responsible for generating the\nfinal response to the user\u2019s query \ud835\udc5e. It takes the selected document\nUser Query \ud835\udc5e\nInitialize State S\nKnowledge Agent\nBias Detection Agent\nSource\nSelection\nEnabled?\nSource Selection Agent\nWriter Agent\nFinal Answer\nSource\nSelected?\nyes\nno\nyes\nno\nFigure 4: Execution flow of the Bias Mitigation Framework\nacross all operational modes\n\ud835\udefc, as determined by the system, and synthesizes a coherent and\ncontextually grounded response. It is provided with the original user\nquery \ud835\udc5eand the selected source document \ud835\udefcas part of a structured\nsystem prompt. The agent is explicitly instructed to rely only on the\ncontent of the provided source for its answer generation. This helps\nensure factual accuracy and reduces bias by limiting the response\nto the selected source. The writer agent marks the final stage of\nthe pipeline. Upon generating a satisfactory response, the manager\nagent terminates the execution and returns the output to the user.\nTogether, these Worker Agents form a tightly integrated and\nmodular pipeline within the Bias Mitigation Framework. Each agent\nis designed to fulfill a distinct and well-scoped responsibility, en-\nabling separation of concerns and ease of extension. By delegat-\ning complex tasks such as retrieval, bias evaluation, source selec-\ntion, and response generation to specialized agents, the system\nensures robustness, adaptability, and transparency across diverse\nuser queries and fairness constraints. Figure 4 elaborates on the\nend-to-end execution flow, highlighting how these agents interact\nin different operating modes to ensure reliable and bias minimized\nanswer to the user\u2019s query \ud835\udc5e.\n4\nExperimentation\nThis section evaluates the performance of the Bias Mitigation Agent\nin its ability to reduce bias while maintaining relevance to the orig-\ninal user query. The agent uses annotated news articles sourced\nfrom the MBIC [21] and BABE datasets [20] to evaluate its bias\ndetection and mitigation capabilities.

As shown in Table 1 has the fastest\nresponse time among the methods, averaging 12.06 seconds per\nquery (\u00b1 2.45) among all models and modes. It achieved a relevance\nscore of 0.181 (\u00b1 0.131) when using GPT-4.1-mini.

The beat average relevance\nscore was 0.366 (\u00b1 0.367), which is even better than the baseline\nmodel in terms of utility of the answers to the queries between\nall models and modes. However, the zero-shot mode incurred the\nhighest latency, averaging 41.38 seconds (\u00b1 13.89) for GPT-4o-mini,\n28.66 seconds (\u00b1 13.41) for GPT-4.1, and 35.45 seconds (\u00b1 15.98)\nfor GPT-4.1-mini, as given in Table 1. It also has taken multiple\nhops in 70.54%, 21.43%, and 26.79% of queries using GPT-4o-mini,\nGPT-4.1, and GPT-4.1-mini as depicted in Figure 6 respectively. The\nhigh retry rate suggests that it adopts a more cautious and itera-\ntive selection strategy due to the lack of in-context information.\nLastly, its average bias confidence was 0.805 (\u00b1 0.1431) using GPT-\n4o-mini, 0.841 (\u00b1 0.130) using GPT-4.1, and 0.837 (\u00b1 0.123) using\nGPT-4.1-mini.\n4.3\nFew-Shot\nThe few-shot mode utilizes in-context examples to improve se-\nlection accuracy. Figure 5 shows that in case of GPT-4o-mini, it\nachieved a bias rate of 14.3%, demonstrating a substantial improve-\nment over the baseline mode by 69.48%. Also, while using GPT-4.1\nand GPT-4.1-mini, it generated bias results only 17.86% and 23.21%\nof the time which is the lowest when using these models as rea-\nsoning engines. As mentioned in Table 1, the average relevance\nscore of 0.236 (\u00b1 0.251) was achieved, which is higher than the\nbaseline mode for all models. The major improvement came with\nthe average latency which is 37.79 seconds (\u00b1 11.40), 26.93 seconds\n(\u00b1 11.99), and 30.58 seconds (\u00b1 13.63) using GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1,\nGPT-4.1-mini; therefore, it is slightly faster than the zero-shot mode\nwhile all the time, as shown in Table 1. Also, Figure 6 shows that it\nis more decisive as it only retried 29.46%, 18.75%, and 16.07% of the\ntime using GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, and GPT-4.1-mini.\nIn summary, when comparing both models, GPT-4.1-mini consis-\ntently outperformed GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1 in relevance, achieving\nthe highest average relevance score of 0.366 (\u00b1 0.367) in zero-shot\nmode which supports its superior ability to generate contextually\naligned responses. On the other hand, in terms of bias reduction,\nGPT-4o-mini with zero-shot mode achieved the lowest bias rate\noverall at 8.93%, although with increased latency and variability.\n5\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we introduce the Bias Mitigation Agent, a novel multi-\nagent framework designed to enhance fairness and trust in agentic\ninformation retrieval systems by optimizing the source selection\nprocess.

Explainable Machine Generated Text Detection\nin Dialogues\n*Angela Yifei Yuan1, *Haoyi Li1, Soyeon Caren Han1, Christopher Leckie\u20201\n1The University of Melbourne\n{angela.yuan, haoyil4}@student.unimelb.edu.au, {caren.han, caleckie}@unimelb.edu.au\nAbstract\nThe rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in\ncustomer service introduces new risks, as malicious actors\ncan exploit them to conduct large-scale user impersonation\nthrough machine-generated text (MGT). Current MGT detec-\ntion methods often struggle in online conversational settings,\nreducing the reliability and interpretability essential for trust-\nworthy AI deployment. In customer service scenarios where\noperators are typically non-expert users, explanation become\ncrucial for trustworthy MGT detection. In this paper, we\npropose EMMM, an explanation-then-detection framework\nthat balances latency, accuracy, and non-expert-oriented in-\nterpretability. Experimental results demonstrate that EMMM\nprovides explanations accessible to non-expert users, with\n70% of human evaluators preferring its outputs, while achiev-\ning competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models\nand maintaining low latency, generating outputs within 1 sec-\nond. Our code and dataset are open-sourced1.\n1\nIntroduction\nLarge language models (LLMs) have revolutionized hu-\nman\u2013AI interaction, enabling highly realistic conversations\nacross a wide range of applications. However, this progress\nalso brings serious security risks: malicious actors can ex-\nploit LLMs to impersonate users and launch large-scale at-\ntacks on online platforms. Such misuse can disrupt critical\nservices such as emergency response and customer support,\nleading to denial-of-service incidents and operational fail-\nures (OWASP 2025). As LLMs continue to proliferate, re-\nliable and explainable detection of machine-generated text\n(MGT) in conversational settings has become essential for\nsafeguarding platform reliability and user trust. Existing de-\ntectors focus on isolated text passages, and they often strug-\ngle to adapt to the dynamic and interleaved structure of\nreal-world conversations. Moreover, trust in MGT detec-\ntion systems, especially in online conversational environ-\nments, requires explanations that are interpretable to diverse\nusers, including non-experts. In such settings, explanations\nmust be clear and accessible to support understanding of\n*These authors contributed equally.\n\u2020Corresponding author\n1https://github.com/AngieYYF/EMMM-explainable-chatbot-\ndetection\nmodel behavior, review flagged cases, and inform modera-\ntion decisions. To address this, we propose EMMM, a frame-\nwork specifically designed for real-time MGT detection in\nconversational settings. By leveraging conversation struc-\nture, EMMM achieves high detection accuracy while of-\nfering multi-level, multi-dimension, and multi-strategy ex-\nplanations tailored for broad user accessibility. We iden-\ntify three key challenges unique to explainable MGT detec-\ntion in conversational settings. First, asymmetric detection\nin dialogues, where interactions are interleaved but detec-\ntion targets only one party, creates an unusual input struc-\nture that limits the model from using full conversational\ncontext and necessitates specialized handling. Second, user-\nfriendly explanations for non-experts remain limited, as cur-\nrent methods frequently use technical metrics such as feature\nweights (Shah et al. 2023; Schoenegger, Xia, and Roth 2024)\nwhich are inaccessible to service operators without technical\nbackgrounds. Third, local attribution explanations in MGT\ndetection models are difficult to interpret due to the absence\nof ground-truth, whereas globally aggregated explanations\nlack the granularity needed for instance-level interpretation.\nTo address these challenges, we propose EMMM, an\nexplanation-driven framework for interpretable LLM chat-\nbot detection in conversational settings. EMMM integrates\n(1) Multi-dimensional inputs (behaviors and language), op-\nerates at (2) Multi-level interaction (turn and dialogue),\nand employs (3) Multi-strategy explanation (local natu-\nral language explanations, and semi-global visual insights).\nGuided by speech act theory (Austin 1975), EMMM ex-\nplicitly incorporates dialogue acts into its design. It pro-\ncesses each incoming user utterance through turn-level and\ndialogue-level detection modules, selectively aggregating\nimportant features across turns. The system generates an ex-\nplanation report that combines highlighted features, natural\nlanguage reasoning, and semi-global visualizations, as illus-\ntrated in Figure 1. This approach effectively addresses asym-\nmetric detection by isolating and selectively processing the\ntarget party\u2019s utterances within dialogue turns. The gener-\nated explanation report enhances accessibility for non-expert\nusers by articulating raw attribution data in natural language,\nand improves MGT detection interpretability by incorporat-\ning semi-global model insights to balance local relevance\nwith global interpretability.\nContributions of EMMM can be summarized as follows:\narXiv:2508.18715v1  [cs.CL]  26 Aug 2025\n\nFigure 1: A demonstration of EMMM framework online detection and non-expert oriented explanation.\n\u2022 EMMM is Dialogue-Aware. EMMM leverages con-\nversation specific features to deliver multi-dimension,\nmulti-level, and multi-strategy explanations. Grounded\nin speech act theory, it models dialogue structure and\nintent to enhance interpretability. EMMM supports both\nonline and offline chatbot detection, achieving a balance\nbetween detection performance and explanation quality.\n\u2022 EMMM is Efficient. EMMM produces explanation re-\nports online in under 1 second by combining a sequen-\ntial selector\u2013predictor pipeline with offline preprocess-\ning, achieving the time efficiency required for deploy-\nment in real-world service platforms.\n\u2022 EMMM is Interpretable. EMMM generates non-expert\nuser friendly natural language explanation reports and\nincludes visualizations of contextualized semi-global\nmodel behaviors to enhance model interpretability. We\nevaluate interpretability via qualitative analysis and a hu-\nman survey, showing strong user preference of 69% over\na baseline attribution approach.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework to\ntackle the challenging problem of explainable MGT detec-\ntion for non-expert users in conversational settings, paving\nthe way for practical, human-aligned AI safety solutions.\n2\nRelated Work\nMGT Detection\nA wide range of methods have been explored for MGT de-\ntection, which aims to classify whether a given text was pro-\nduced by a human or by a LLM. Approaches include wa-\ntermarking techniques that embed hidden signals in gener-\nated content (Lu et al. 2024; Kirchenbauer et al. 2023), as\nwell as zero-shot and supervised classification models. For\nexample, Binoculars (Hans et al. 2024) is a statistical zero-\nshot method using two language models to compute an AI-\nlikelihood score based on entropy differences, requiring no\ntraining data. In contrast, supervised models excel in spe-\ncialized tasks by learning meaningful patterns from labeled\ntraining data (Wu et al. 2025; Bafna et al. 2024).\nExisting work on MGT detection primarily focuses on\ntext passages, overlooking the complexity and interpretative\nrichness of online dialogues. To address this, we propose\nEMMM tailored for real-time detection of LLM chatbots\nin online dialogues, leveraging dialogue-specific features to\nprovide explanations that non-expert users can interpret.\nExplaining MGT Detection\nExplaining a MGT detection model involves understanding\nits decision-making process to foster user trust and evaluate\nmodel performance (Luo et al. 2024). There are two com-\nmon local explanation approaches, attribution-based expla-\nnations and Natural Language Explanations (NLE).\nAttribution-based Explanations\nAttribution methods as-\nsign importance scores to input features for a specific pre-\ndiction (Sundararajan, Taly, and Yan 2017; Tsai, Yeh, and\nRavikumar 2023). This is the primary method used in ex-\nisting MGT detection work, identifying importance of ex-\ntracted attributes in feature-based detection (Shah et al.\n2023), or tokens and phrases in pretrained language model\n(PLM)\u2013based approaches (Schoenegger, Xia, and Roth\n2024). Token and phrase attribution has been widely applied\nin tasks such as sentiment analysis and reading comprehen-\nsion, where the importance scores are expected to align with\nintuitively relevant input regions for interpretability (Tsang,\nRambhatla, and Liu 2020). However, MGT detection lacks\nground-truth important tokens, making interpretation more\nchallenging. Global aggregation of local explanations can\nreveal broader model patterns to assist interpretation (Mor,\nBelinkov, and Kimelfeld 2024) but lacks relevance to indi-\nvidual predictions. We address this by providing semi-global\nmodel insights contextualized by target samples, enabling a\nhigher-level yet relevant understanding of model behavior.\nNatural Language Explanations (NLE)\nNLE methods\ngenerate textual explanations for model predictions. Unlike\nraw attribution scores, which can be difficult for users to in-\nterpret, they aim to produce explanations that better align\nwith human understanding and values. These methods fall\ninto two categories: generation-based and template-based.

Aggregating Language Use\nIf the utterance is detected as human-generated, the scores are usually at or below the threshold (shown in blue or no color).

This poses a challenge for MGT detection due\nto the lack of NLE-labeled data, and limited understand-\ning of the differences between human and LLM chatbots in\ndialogue settings for NLE labeling. Prior attempts at NLE\nannotation targeted text passages and relied on domain ex-\nperts, which is costly and not feasible at scale (Ji et al. 2024;\nRussell, Karpinska, and Iyyer 2025). Template-based ap-\nproaches offer a more practical alternative to enhance inter-\npretability of raw explanation data, by defining explanation\nsentence templates filled in per sample (Zhang and Chen\n2020). We propose a novel template using attribution in-\nsights to generate human-readable and interpretable expla-\nnations efficiently. This approach does not require prior in-\ntuition about the detection task for NLE annotation.\nExplanations for Non-experts\nHuman-understandable explanations are widely recognized\nfor their benefits, including improved efficiency and broader\nstakeholder coverage (Cambria et al. 2023). They aim to\nconvey a model\u2019s decision-making process to non-expert\nusers, often through natural language (Burton, Moubayed,\nand Enshaei 2023) or intuitive visualizations (Kang et al.\n2025) that make complex model behavior more accessible.\nRecent work has incorporated human\u2013computer interaction\n(HCI) principles to guide the design of explanations, with\nnaturalness, flexibility, and usefulness consistently emerging\nas critical factors (Chromik and Butz 2021; Ji et al. 2024).\nBuilding on these insights, our research focuses on these\nthree aspects in designing explanation reports, resulting in\nexplanations that are better aligned with human values.\n3\nOur Framework - EMMM\nDue to the unique characteristics of multi-turn dialogues and\nthe need for transparency in model decisions, we propose\nEMMM, an explainable detection framework designed to\naddress key challenges in MGT detection within conversa-\ntional settings. EMMM stands for Multi-Dimensional and\nMulti-Level detection and explanation, and Multi-Strategy\nexplanation reporting. The overall process of EMMM is il-\nlustrated in Figure 2 and can be summarized as follows for\neach turn during an online conversation:\n1. Arrival of new user utterance: A new user utterance\narrives, with sensitive information masked.\n2. Dialogue acts extraction: dialogue acts (DAs) are ex-\ntracted from the user utterance.\n3. Turn-level detection: Multi-dimensional detection is\nperformed using the DAs and the utterance respectively.\n4. Attribution explanation: Important features (DAs and\ntokens) from the current turn are identified.\n5. Aggregate important features across turns: DAs and\nutterances from all turns are concatenated, while unim-\nportant features are replaced by mask tokens.\n6. Dialogue-level detection: Detection is performed using\nthe masked dialogue-level features.\n7. Explanation report: An explanation report is generated.\nDuring offline chatbot detection, all utterances are readily\navailable to undergo steps 2 to 5 before the framework pro-\nceeds to step 6 for dialogue-level detection.\nWith the overall workflow established, the following sec-\ntions describe the core components of EMMM, detailing\nhow it realizes its objectives through: (i) Multi-Dimensional\ndetection and explanation, integrating both linguistic signals\nand user behavior for richer interpretability; (ii) Multi-Level\ndetection and explanation, enabling efficient hierarchical de-\ntection across turns and dialogues; and (iii) Multi-Strategy\nexplanation reporting, delivering natural language local ex-\nplanations complemented by semi-global visual insights for\nenhanced transparency.\nMulti-Dimensional Detection and Explanation\nSpeech act theory states that language use not only con-\nveys information but also performs actions through ut-\nterances (Austin 1975). Dialogue Acts (DAs) encode the\nspeaker\u2019s intent and the pragmatic function of each utter-\nance. For example, the DA (inform, hotel, area, west) indi-\ncates a user informing a hotel area preference. Existing ap-\nproaches to MGT detection and explanation predominantly\n\n\u2018THE UNIVERSITY OF\nMELBOURNE\n\nHello, how can | help you?\n\nI'm looking for a guesthouse in\nthe east with free WIFI.\n\n| have a few options that match your\ncriteria. ...\n\n\nBu\n\n\nrely on raw tokens, overlooking such structured communica-\ntive functions that offer a behavior-oriented perspective be-\nyond surface-level linguistic cues. This motivates our use\nof DA extraction to capture user intent and support richer\nMulti-Dimensional explanations. We omit the value element\n(e.g., \u201cwest\u201d) to abstract away from specific slot values and\nfocus on the underlying behavioral intent.\nMulti-Level Detection and Explanation\nMulti-turn dialogues arrive incrementally, and users expect\nreal-time feedback. As feature attribution costs grow expo-\nnentially with accumulating features across turns, dialogue-\nlevel explanations become computationally expensive. To\nenable efficient Multi-Level explanation, EMMM employs\na sequential selector\u2013predictor design (Luo et al. 2024): the\nselector identifies important features from turn-level attribu-\ntions, which are concatenated and passed as the dialogue-\nlevel explanation to the dialogue-level predictor. This elim-\ninates the need to recompute the full explanation with each\nnew utterance, and remains faithful by ensuring the predictor\nrelies only on the provided explanations.\nMulti-Strategy Explanation Report\nOur proposed explanation reporting integrates two comple-\nmentary strategies: local narrative explanations and contex-\ntualized semi-global visual insights. Unlike prior single-\nmodality approaches, this combination unites natural lan-\nguage narratives with visual representations, yielding expla-\nnations that enhanced the understanding of non-expert users.\nAn example explanation report is shown in Figure 1.\nNarrative Explanation\nFor narrative explanations, we\ndesign a lightweight natural language template to meet the\nrequirement of low computational complexity. It includes a\nbackground introduction providing context about the input\nand classification task, as well token-level and DA-level ex-\nplanations that use natural language to aid human interpre-\ntation of the attributions. Inspired by HCI principles for ex-\nplainable AI (Chromik and Butz 2021) and discourse anal-\nysis techniques (Liew et al. 2024), we prioritize three crite-\nria: naturalness, flexibility, and usefulness. Naturalness cap-\ntures how easily users can comprehend the model\u2019s output.\nFlexibility reflects the ability to convey multiple perspec-\ntives and information types. Usefulness measures the effec-\ntiveness of the explanation to resolve users\u2019 potential confu-\nsion about detection results. Discourse-aware elements, such\nas highlighting rhetorical patterns, help bridge the gap be-\ntween technical attributions and non-expert understanding.\nThe template was iteratively refined with input from experts\nand user feedback, to ensure clarity and accessibility without\ncompromising efficiency.\nContextualized Semi-global Aggregation\nTo comple-\nment the local narrative explanation, we propose Contex-\ntualized Semi-Global Visualization, which addresses the\nlimited relevance of global model insights to specific tar-\nget samples. Existing methods aggregate local explanations\nacross datasets to derive global insights, but often fail to re-\nflect the context of individual samples, limiting their support\nfor instance-level user understanding. Our method leverages\nAlgorithm 1: Semi-Global Aggregation - Offline\nInput: Dataset D with utterances and Dialogue Acts (DAs)\nOutput: Aggregated scores A, top features F\n1: A, F \u2190{}, {}\n// Initialize scores and features\n2: for each DA \u2208DA types(D) do\n3:\nTDA \u2190ExtractFeaturesPerDA(D, DA)\n4:\nL \u2190GetLocalAttributionScores(TDA)\n5:\nfor each class c \u2208{AI, Human} do\n6:\nA[DA][c] \u2190GlobalAggregation(L, c)\n7:\nF[DA][c] \u2190TopK(A[DA][c])\n8:\nend for\n9: end for\n10: return A, F\nAlgorithm 2: Semi-Global Aggregation - Online\nInput: Target DAs DAutt, target class c, top features F\nOutput: Semi-global important features S\n1: S \u2190{}\n// Initialize feature-score map\n2: for each DA \u2208DAutt do\n3:\nfor each (f, s) \u2208F[DA][c] do\n4:\nS[f] \u2190S[f] + s\n// Accumulate score\n5:\nend for\n6: end for\n7: return S\ndialogue acts, grouping utterance sub-strings based on their\nconveyed DA and aggregating local explanations within\neach DA category. This contextualized aggregation produces\nsemi-global insights that better align with the target sample.\nAlgorithms 1 and 2 describe the computation of DA-based\naggregation scores across a dataset and their use in the online\nexplanation process for a target utterance. A feature refers to\na token or phrase extracted from text spans associated with\na specific DA. During the offline phase (Algorithm 1), local\nattribution scores are computed for each token in the dataset\nusing attribution methods, and phrase-level scores are ob-\ntained by averaging the attributions of constituent tokens.\nFeatures are grouped by DA type, and attribution scores\nare aggregated across features within the same group using\nglobal aggregation methods, producing DA-specific attribu-\ntion profiles for each class. The top ranked features per DA\nfor the AI and Human classes are recorded with their associ-\nated scores. During online application (Algorithm 2), semi-\nglobal important features are extracted by retrieving and ac-\ncumulating scores of the top features for each DA in the tar-\nget utterance. This DA-aware aggregation balances the in-\nterpretability of global model insights with the contextual\nrelevance of local explanations. Implementation details, in-\ncluding feature matching between DAs and text spans, and\nword cloud construction, are provided in Appendix A.\nEMMM Implementation\nEMMM supports flexible integration of different detection\nmodels and feature attribution methods. We conducted ex-\ntensive experiments based on detection performance to de-\ntermine an effective configuration. The chosen implementa-\n\ntion fine-tunes a DistilGPT2 model (Sanh et al. 2019) for\nboth turn-level act-based and utterance-based detection. For\nfeature attribution, we apply Faith-SHAP (Tsai, Yeh, and\nRavikumar 2023) to identify up to three dialogue acts and\nthree tokens per utterance with the highest absolute attribu-\ntion scores. The turn-level detection models are further fine-\ntuned using the most influential acts and tokens across all\nturns to enable dialogue-level detection. Act and token em-\nbeddings are combined via average fusion and passed into\nthe final classification layer. DA extraction uses a supervised\nmodel (Zhu et al. 2023) for the SPADE dataset, and few shot\nprompting Qwen2.5-7B (Qwen Team 2024) for Frames. Ex-\nperimental details are provided in Appendix B.\n4\nExperimental Methodology\nDatasets\nWe experiment on two datasets. SPADE (Li et al. 2025) is\nthe only benchmark for LLM chatbot detection in conversa-\ntional settings, containing hotel-domain bona fide from the\nMultiWOZ dataset (Eric et al. 2020) and LLM-generated di-\nalogues. We use its End-to-End Conversation dataset, where\ntwo LLM instances simulate a conversation, acting as sys-\ntem and user respectively to achieve the user goal (Li\net al. 2025). To expand domain coverage, we extend its\ndata generation framework to the travel-domain Frames\ndataset (Schulz et al. 2017) using Qwen2.5-32B (Qwen\nTeam 2024). This results in a new dataset comprising 1364\npairs of bona fide and synthetic dialogues. Dataset genera-\ntion details are provided in Appendix D. We randomly di-\nvide each dataset by dialogue ID into training, validation,\nand test sets in a 70%/15%/15% ratio.\nEvaluation Metrics\nThe framework is evaluated on four key criteria essential for\nhuman-aligned deployment of LLM chatbot detection mod-\nels in real-world applications:\n\u2022 Detection Performance is measured by Macro-F1 score,\nwhere higher values indicate better performance. Super-\nvised non-deterministic models are run four times, and\nresults are averaged.\n\u2022 Explanation Relevance is measured by AOPCk(G, c)\nmetric (Mor, Belinkov, and Kimelfeld 2024), which\nquantifies the impact of the top k features from aggre-\ngation G on class c predictions. Higher scores reflect\nstronger relevance and alignment with model behavior.\n\u2022 Interpretability is evaluated via a human survey, com-\nparing user preference between EMMM explanation re-\nport and the baseline attribution explanation.\n\u2022 Time Complexity for each step of the framework is mea-\nsured in seconds per utterance.\nBaselines\nFor detection performance, we compare EMMM against a\nrange of existing MGT detection models, including zero-\nshot, pretrained supervised, and fully trained supervised\napproaches.

For pretrained super-\nvised models, we evaluate RADAR (Hu, Chen, and Ho\n2023) and ChatGPTDroberta (Guo et al. 2023) using their of-\nficially released weights without additional fine-tuning. We\nalso compare against supervised models trained on the tar-\nget datasets, including Raidarllama (Mao et al. 2024) using\ntheir llama2 7b chat implementation, entropy-based detec-\ntion (Gehrmann, Strobelt, and Rush 2019; Li et al. 2025)\ncomputed with TF-IDF features, and both random forest\nand multilayer perceptron (MLP) trained on TF-IDF embed-\ndings. Model and training details are in Appendix B.\nFor explanation interpretability evaluation, our explana-\ntion report is compared against the content of local feature\nattribution methods, which is the primary existing approach\nfor explaining MGT detection models (Shah et al. 2023;\nSchoenegger, Xia, and Roth 2024).\n5\nExperimental Results\nDetection Performance: Does EMMM detect MGT\naccurately?\nDuring detection, user utterances are extracted from the di-\nalogues and concatenated as input to the detection models.\nTable 1 presents the Macro-F1 score of detection models.\nOur framework, EMMM, maintains state-of-the-art detec-\ntion performance, achieving an average Macro-F1 of 0.9858.\nAs detailed in Section 3, EMMM employs a sequential se-\nlector\u2013predictor pipeline designed to provide efficient and\ndetailed interpretability, avoiding the costly generation of\nexplanations for the entire dialogue. Despite using only\nthree tokens and three dialogue acts per utterance, EMMM\nconsistently outperforms zero-shot, pre-trained supervised,\nand most fully supervised baselines. This shows that our\nproposed framework offers reliable detection performance\nwhile advancing the efficiency and explainability required\nfor real-world, human-aligned deployment.\nTable 2 compares detection performance under differ-\nent attribution methods and feature budgets per utterance.\n\nFigure 3: Comparison of explanation relevance between semi-global (-DA) and global (-global) aggregations using\nAOPCk(G, c) scores (y-axis) across different values of k (x-axis).

Best scores per\ngroup are bolded, second-best are underlined.\nThe attribution methods include Faith-SHAP (Tsai, Yeh, and\nRavikumar 2023), Shapley Taylor Interaction Index (Sun-\ndararajan, Dhamdhere, and Agarwal 2020), and Integrated\nGradients (Sundararajan, Taly, and Yan 2017), covering\nboth white-box techniques and model-agnostic approaches\nthat approximate the Shapley values (Shapley 1953). Faith-\nSHAP consistently ranks first or second in Macro-F1,\ndemonstrating its reliability and effectiveness in identify-\ning salient features. Nevertheless, all attribution methods\nachieve strong performance under strict interpretability con-\nstraints (> 0.9 Macro-F1), underscoring the framework\u2019s ro-\nbustness across different implementations.\nExplanation Relevance: Are aggregated\nexplanations relevant to local predictions?\nThis study applies two aggregation metrics: (1) AGG, pro-\nposed for global aggregation of local explanations (Mor, Be-\nlinkov, and Kimelfeld 2024), and (2) log odds ratio with in-\nformative Dirichlet prior (LOR), designed to identify dispro-\nportionate word usage between two corpora (Monroe, Co-\nlaresi, and Quinn 2008). Based on feature attributions in the\ntraining dataset, we define two corpora: the AI corpus, con-\ntaining features with positive attribution toward AI predic-\ntions, and the Human corpus, containing features with neg-\native attribution. For AGG, originally applied to \u201canchors\u201d\nFigure 4: An example comparison of contextualized semi-\nglobal and global aggregation.\nselected as important features for a prediction of class c,\nwe analogously define the anchor frequency of a token t for\nclass c as its frequency in the corresponding corpus of the\nclass c. LOR uses the two corpora directly as input.\nFigure 3 presents the results of the area over the perturba-\ntion curve (AOPC), of an EMMM turn-level utterance-based\ndetection model. Aggregating local explanations based on\ndialogue acts yields higher AOPC scores than global aggre-\ngation, with one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank tests on paired\nper-sample AOPCk values across k \u226420 yielding p < 0.05\nin all settings of datasets, classes, and aggregation metrics.\nIn particular, AOPC scores are lower for human-predicted\nsamples, which aligns with prior studies showing that hu-\nman language exhibits greater linguistic variability (Mu\u02dcnoz-\nOrtiz, G\u00b4omez-Rodr\u00b4\u0131guez, and Vilares 2024). This variability\nreduces the overlap between the top 20 aggregated tokens\nand those in individual samples. Overall, these results indi-\ncate that our contextualization technique based on DA offers\nsemi-global model insights that are more relevant and infor-\n\nAOPC-k\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\nSPADE: Al SPADE: Human Frames: Al Frames: Human\nLA _\nSF\n10 20 0 10 20 0 10 20 0 10 20\nk k k k\n\u2014 AGG-global \u2014\u2014 AGG-DA LOR-global \u2014\u2014 LOR-DA\n\n\nuser: Hi, I\u2019m looking for a vacation package from Calgary to St. Louis from August 17 to\n\nAugust 31 for one person.

Partic-\nipants are divided into two groups depending on their prior\nunderstanding of how AI models make decisions.\nmative for understanding local predictions.\nFor qualitative analysis, Figure 4 illustrates an example\nof DA-based and global aggregation. The left word cloud\nshows the top 20 phrases per DA, while the right shows the\ntop 20 global phrases. The phrases are ranked by frequency-\nweighted LOR, highlighting high-frequency phrases dispro-\nportionally contributing to a class. Text size is scaled by\nboth the weighted score and phrase length for clearer visu-\nalization. DA-based aggregation reveals phrases more rele-\nvant to the current utterance when comparing AI and human\nclassifications. For example, AI-contributing features in-\nclude question-oriented phrases such as \u201cany options?\u201d and\n\u201cany recommendations?\u201d when stating travel needs, whereas\nhuman-contributing features tend to convey needs directly\nwithout posing questions, and may include personal con-\ntext like \u201cmy wife\u201d, \u201cfriends\u201d, etc. In contrast, global aggre-\ngation highlights the most influential class-specific phrases\nacross the dataset but lacks specificity to the target utter-\nance. While long-form texts can be grouped by topic, task-\noriented dialogues benefit from grouping by dialogue acts to\ncapture relevant and detailed contextual explanations.\nInterpretability: Do humans prefer EMMM\u2019s\nexplanations?\nWe conducted a human survey to evaluate the interpretabil-\nity of our output explanations. In this experiment, we ran-\ndomly selected four representative samples, each covering\na different dataset and prediction class. All 13 participants\nwere asked to review these samples, resulting in a total\nof 52 survey responses. For each survey, participants in-\ndicate their preference between our framework\u2019s generated\nexplanation and a baseline attribution-based explanation. A\nsample of our explanation is shown in Figure 1. The base-\nline attribution-based explanation displays the top 10 most\nimportant tokens and 3 dialogue acts (DAs) per utterance,\nsorted by descending absolute attribution scores. Attribution\nscores are provided for both tokens and DAs. Further details\nabout the survey design are provided in Appendix C. To as-\nsess how well our explanations support both expert and non-\nexpert users, we divided participants into two groups: one\nwith prior knowledge of how AI models typically make de-\nStep\nModule\nSPADE\nFrames\n2\nDA Extraction\n0.8449\n3.4771\n3\nTurn-level Detection\n0.0336\n0.0335\n4\nAttribution Explanation\n0.5157\n0.4334\n5,6\nDialogue-level Detection\n0.3599\n0.3633\n7\nExplanation Report\n0.4379\n0.3893\n4,7\nExplanation\n0.9536\n0.8227\n1-7\nFramework\n2.1921\n4.6966\nTable 3: Breakdown of framework average time complexity\nper utterance in seconds.

In general, 69%\nof the participant responses preferred the explanations gen-\nerated by our framework over attribution-based methods.\nParticipants without prior knowledge of how AI models\nmake decisions showed an even stronger preference for\nour framework (71.42%), compared to those with relevant\nbackground knowledge (66.67%). These results suggest that\nour explanation framework offers general advantages across\nuser groups, particularly in enhancing accessibility and in-\nterpretability for non-technical users. This highlights its po-\ntential for real-world applications where explanations need\nto be interpretable by a broad audience. To further support\nour conclusion, we evaluate the explanations generated by\nEMMM based on three HCI principles, with the score ratios\nprovided in Appendix C.\nTime Complexity: Can it run in real time?\nWe evaluated the time complexity of our detection explana-\ntion framework by averaging the runtime over 100 randomly\nselected utterances from each dataset. Table 3 provides a de-\ntailed breakdown of the time consumed by each step within\nthe framework.\nReport generation is highly efficient, completing within\n0.5 second by leveraging pre-computed aggregation scores\nand natural language templates. The overall explanation pro-\ncess, including attribution and report generation, remains\nunder one second, demonstrating suitability for near real-\ntime applications. Notably, dialogue act extraction is the pri-\nmary bottleneck, especially for the Frames dataset where\nLLM-based extraction takes over 3 seconds. This step can\nbe replaced by a supervised model for greater efficiency, as\nshown by SPADE with runtime under one second.\n6\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we present EMMM, the first explainable chat-\nbot detection framework tailored for LLM-generated con-\ntent in conversational settings. EMMM addresses critical\nchallenges in chatbot detection, including dialogue-specific\nstructure and the interpretability gap for non-expert users.\nThrough a dialogue-aware architecture and an efficient se-\nlector\u2013predictor pipeline, EMMM achieves state-of-the-art\ndetection accuracy while delivering turn and dialogue-level\nexplanations within real-time constraints. Our interpretabil-\nity evaluation demonstrates that EMMM\u2019s natural language\n\nPercentage (%)\n\n100\n\nSurvey Preference: Attribution Explanation vs EMMM\n\n3.58%\n66.67%\n71.42%\nNo Prior Knowledge Has Prior Knowledge\n(7 participants, 28 surveys) (6 participants, 24 surveys)\n\n@ Attribution Explanation\n\nEMMM\n\n1.91%\n\n69.24%\n\nTotal\n(13 participants, 52 surveys)\n\nTie\n\n\nexplanations and semi-global visualizations significantly\nimprove user comprehension, with a 69% preference over\nthe baseline approach.

Singa-\npore: Association for Computational Linguistics.\n\nA\nContextualized Semi-global Aggregation\nText-DA Matching\nThe function ExtractFeaturesPerDA(D, DA) in Algorithm 1\nextracts all token or phrasal features in all user utterances in\nthe dataset D that are matched to a specific DA.\nGiven an utterance (Tutt) and the associated DAs (DAutt\nwith |DAutt| \u22651), we aim to find utterance text spans asso-\nciated with each DA. An embedding-based approach is used\nto find matching pairs of utterance tokens and DAs:\n1. Convert each DAi (intent, domain, slot, value) to a text\nstring TDA,i in format \u201c{intent or intent description}\n{slot and optionally (slot description)} {value}\u201d. For ex-\nample, (inform, travel, or city, Gotham City) is converted\nto \u201cinform or city (Origin city) Gotham City\u201d. Whereas\nnon-natural language intents like \u201cnobook\u201d is replaced\nby their description of \u201cbooking is failed\u201d.\n2. Encoder inference on entire utterance (Tutt), and on\neach individual DA text (TDA,i \u2208DAutt). This study\nuses a paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2 model (Reimers and\nGurevych 2019) fine-tuned for 3 epochs on a balanced\ndataset of positive and negative samples using CosineS-\nimilarityLoss. For each utterance in the training set, pos-\nitive samples have it paired with their associated DAs\n(converted to text strings and concatenated), whereas\nnegative samples have it paired with concatenated DAs\nof a randomly sampled utterance.\n3. Extract token embeddings for each utterance token\n(tutt \u2208Tutt), and for each DA token (tDA \u2208TDA,i)\n4. Calculate cosine similarity for each pair of utterance and\nDA tokens: {cos sim(tutt, tDA)|tutt \u2208Tutt, tDA \u2208\nTDA,i, TDA,i \u2208DAutt}\n5. Similarity between an utterance token and an entire\nDA is defined as the maximum similarity score be-\ntween the utterance token with each DA token within the\nDA: s(tutt, TDA,i) = max{cos sim(tutt, tDA)|tDA \u2208\nTDA,i}\n6. Cross-Domain Similarity Local Scaling (CSLS) (Lam-\nple et al. 2018) adjusts similarity scores by increas-\ning those for features with few close neighbors and de-\ncreasing those for features with many. This reduces the\ninfluence of tokens that are broadly similar to many\nDAs, or vice versa, ensuring more relevant matches are\nprioritized. The CSLS-adjusted similarity is computed\nas: scsls(tutt, TDA,i) = 2 \u00b7 s(tutt, TDA,i) \u2212r(tutt) \u2212\nr(TDA,i), where r(tutt) is the average of top k = 5\nsimilarity scores between tutt and TDA,i \u2208DAutt, with\nr(TDA,i) computed analogously.\n7. For each utterance token tutt, match it with any DA\nTDA,i that satisfies the condition: scsls(tutt, TDA,i) \u2265\nmintutt + 0.9 \u00d7 (maxtutt \u2212mintutt), where mintutt\nand maxtutt denote the minimum and maximum scsls\nthe token tutt has across all TDA,i \u2208DAutt.\nIf a DA is matched to continuous text spans, n-gram\nphrases can be extracted. To enable investigation of phrase\nstructure rather than specific values such as dates or lo-\ncations, these texts are replaced with special tokens (e.g.,\n<str date>) whenever they exactly match the value compo-\nnent of the DAs.\nWord Cloud Display\nThe top phrases selected based on aggregation scores may\noverlap and hinder explanation interpretation. For example,\n\u201clooking forward to it!\u201d, \u201clooking forward\u201d, \u201cforward\u201d may\nall be returned as important features. For clearer visualiza-\ntion, the word cloud displays features retained upon the fol-\nlowing de-duplication procedure:\n1. Filter duplicates: retain phrases that either (1) do not\nhave any other phrases containing it or (2) do not con-\ntain any other phrases. For example, \u201clooking forward to\nit!\u201d and \u201cforward\u201d would be returned, whereas \u201clooking\nforward\u201d would be removed to reduce duplications.\n2. Merge phrase: merge any two phrases if there exists a\nconsecutive overlap from the 2 ends for a minimum of\nK = 2 tokens. For example, \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to\u201d\nwould be merged with \u201clooking forward to it!\u201d as \u201cI\u2019m\nlooking forward to it!\u201d to further reduce replications.\nB\nExperimental Details\nThis section details the model configurations and training\nspecifics for both our EMMM framework and the base-\nline models. All experiments were conducted on a 80GB\nNVIDIA A100 GPU. Whenever applicable, randomness is\ncontrolled using a seed of 2025.\nEMMM Framework Implementation\nThis section outlines the procedure of configuration setting\nfor the framework implementation, and examines the robust-\nness of framework performance upon different configura-\ntions. Detection performance reported is based on the val-\nidation set.

Three PLMs are assessed based on their turn-level\ndetection performance, as reported in Table 5.\nOverall, distilgpt2 and distilroberta-base demonstrate rel-\natively high and stable performance across different datasets\nand tasks, with distilgpt2 slightly outperforming in three\nout of four settings. Roberta-base tends to have more un-\nstable convergence. Distilgpt2 is selected as the base PLM\nin framework implementation.\n\nPLM\nDA\nUtterance\nSPADE\ndistilgpt2\n0.6350 (0.0077)\n0.9181 (0.0000)\ndistilroberta-base\n0.6440 (0.0035)\n0.9141 (0.0000)\nroberta-base\n0.5465 (0.1229)\n0.7775 (0.0000)\nFrames\ndistilgpt2\n0.7372 (0.0067)\n0.9789 (0.0000)\ndistilroberta-base\n0.7248 (0.0038)\n0.9781 (0.0000)\nroberta-base\n0.5635 (0.1125)\n0.9802 (0.0000)\nTable 5: Comparison of Macro-F1 scores using different\nPLM for turn-level DA-based and utterance-based detection.\nStandard deviations reported in brackets. The best perfor-\nmance per task is bolded, and the second-best is underlined.\nFusion\nFusion techniques are compared by measuring\nmodel\u2019s online detection performance using all DA and to-\nken features across available turns. From Figure 6, different\nfusion techniques exhibit similar performance, indicating\nthat the framework is relatively robust to the fusion method\nused. Average fusion shows slightly better performance than\nconcatenation and max fusion, and is therefore used in the\nframework implementation.\nFigure 6: Comparison of Macro-F1 scores using different\nfusion methods for online detection when different number\nof turns are available progressively.\nFeature attribution\nThe three feature attribution methods\ncompared, along with their configurations, are summarized\nbelow:\n\u2022 Faith-SHAP (Tsai, Yeh, and Ravikumar 2023): 200 per-\nturbations per sample.\n\u2022 Shapley Taylor Interaction Index (STII) (Sundararajan,\nDhamdhere, and Agarwal 2020): 50 perturbations per\nsample, with at least 1 perturbation per feature. The re-\nmaining perturbations are distributed equally across fea-\ntures, rounding up as necessary to ensure equal alloca-\ntion.\n\u2022 Integrated gradient (Sundararajan, Taly, and Yan 2017):\n100 integration steps.\nTo select a feature attribution method, offline dialogue-\nlevel detection performance is evaluated using varying num-\nbers of token and DA features per utterance, selected based\non the rankings of their absolute attribution scores. As\nshown in Table 6, Faith-SHAP consistently ranks first or sec-\nond, and is thus adopted in the framework implementation.\nExplanation\n1DA + 1token\n3DA + 3token\nSPADE\nFaith-SHAP\n0.9470 (0.0118)\n0.9619 (0.0039)\nSTII\n0.8871 (0.0045)\n0.9334 (0.0135)\nIntegrated gradient\n0.9006 (0.0106)\n0.9742 (0.0024)\nFrames\nFaith-SHAP\n0.9890 (0.0012)\n0.9963 (0.0012)\nSTII\n0.9933 (0.0044)\n0.9963 (0.0012)\nIntegrated gradient\n0.9854 (0.0017)\n0.9976 (0.0000)\nTable 6: Macro-F1 scores for different explanation methods\nand maximum number of features per utterance.

Participants were asked to select their pre-\nferred explanation for a given user utterance. Figure 7 illus-\ntrates the traditional attribution-based explanations used as a\nbaseline for comparison. Both baseline and EMMM expla-\nnations are presented with the target utterance with tokens\ncolor-coded by the attribution scores as shown at the top\nof Figure 1. To further validate our framework, we assess\nthe alignment of EMMM\u2019s explanations with the three HCI\nprinciples introduced in Section 3 (naturalness, flexibility,\nand usefulness). Participants rated the generated explana-\ntions on a 5-point preference scale (where 5 indicates perfect\nalignment). As shown in Table 8, EMMM achieves consis-\ntently high average scores across all three criteria, demon-\nstrating strong adherence to human-centric explanation de-\nsign principles. These results empirically demonstrate that\nour proposed method effectively delivers user-centered in-\nterpretability.\nD\nDataset Construction\nWe applied the End-to-End Conversation Framework (Li\net al. 2025) using Qwen2.5-32B (Qwen Team 2024) to gen-\nerate synthetic dialogues based on bona fide samples from\nthe Frames dataset (Schulz et al. 2017).

Standard prompting\nstrategies\u2014zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought\u2014tend to reuse memo-\nrized riddles or perform shallow paraphrasing. We introduce Adaptive\nOriginality Filtering (AOF), a prompting framework that filters redundant\ngenerations using cosine-based similarity rejection, while enforcing lexical\nnovelty and cross-lingual fidelity. Evaluated across three LLMs and four lan-\nguage pairs, AOF-enhanced GPT-4o achieves 0.177 Self-BLEU and 0.915\nDistinct-2 in Japanese, signaling improved lexical diversity and reduced\nredundancy compared to other prompting methods and language pairs.\nOur findings show that semantic rejection can guide culturally grounded,\ncreative generation without task-specific fine-tuning.\n1\nIntroduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) excel across many natural language processing tasks but\noften falter in creative generation within multilingual settings (Zhang (2025); Ismayilzada\net al. (2024)). This limitation is especially apparent in bilingual riddle generation, where\noutputs are frequently rote and easily found online. To address this, we propose Adaptive\nOriginality Filtering (AOF)\u2014a prompting framework that promotes cultural specificity\nand lexical novelty without fine-tuning. AOF employs a semantic rejection mechanism to\ndiscard formulaic outputs and iteratively prompt the model until it produces a response\nthat is both original and culturally coherent. In contrast to existing strategies like zero-shot,\nfew-shot Brown et al. (2020a), and chain-of-thought prompting Wei et al. (2023), which often\nyield paraphrased common riddles, AOF actively steers generation toward novelty and\ncultural fidelity.\nWe ask: Can prompting alone enable culturally aware, original bilingual generation in\nLLMs? To explore this, we apply AOF to three state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, LLaMA\n3.1, DeepSeek) across four language pairs, benchmarking against four standard prompting\nbaselines. We evaluate using metrics for lexical diversity (Distinct-n), redundancy (Self-\nBLEU), bilingual semantic alignment (Cross-Lingual BERTScore), and syntactic validity.\nResults show that AOF significantly improves both originality and cross-cultural alignment.\nBy injecting an external filtering loop into prompting, AOF offers a lightweight, scalable\npath toward more creative and culturally attuned multilingual generation (see Figure 1).\n2\nRelated Work\nMost prior research emphasizes riddle solving rather than generation. Panagiotopoulos et al.\n(2024) and Heavey et al. (2024) developed multilingual inference models for riddle solving\nbut did not extend to generative tasks. Xu et al. (2022) incorporated cultural embeddings for\nChinese riddle comprehension, while Smith et al. (2022) evaluated NLG models on static\nbenchmarks without multilingual or generative scope.\nMultilingual representation efforts like MUSE Lample & Conneau (2019), LASER Chen &\nAvgustinova (2021), and XLM-R Conneau et al.

(2019);\nGritta & Iacobacci (2021) improve alignment but lack capacity for creative language. Dufter\n(2021) noted that such embeddings often collapse metaphorical nuance essential to cultural\ngeneration.\nCreative Language Generation\nCreative generation research has largely focused on\nideation and open-domain tasks Ma et al. (2025). Cox et al. (2021; 2023) used structured\nprompts for idea diversity, while Huang et al. (2023) improved multilingual output via\ncross-lingual-thought prompting without filtering. Constraint-based methods like Yang et al.\n(2022) and Laverghetta Jr et al. (2024) use decoding control or heuristics to boost diversity.\nStructural prompting has also gained traction: de Wynter et al. (2023) introduced recursive\nmeta-prompts, Verma et al. (2024) identified abstraction limits in ReAct prompting, and Liu\net al. (2024) applied paraphrasing under semantic constraints. Atmakuru et al. (2024) bench-\nmarked narrative creativity under fixed templates, highlighting rejection-based filtering as\na viable originality enhancer.\nPrompting for Originality and Structure\nStandard approaches prioritize structure over\ncreativity. Few-shot prompting Brown et al. (2020a;b) and CoT Wei et al. (2023) improve\nreasoning but often replicate training artifacts. Iterative methods like Self-Refine Madaan\net al. (2023), Tree-of-Thought Yao et al. (2023), and Reflexion Krishna et al. (2023) enhance\nfluency and factuality through retries but rarely enforce novelty.\nConstraint-driven prompting offers stronger generative control. COLD decoding Mou et al.\n(2022), EditCoT Wang et al. (2024), and Sketch-of-Thought Aytes et al. (2025) use template-\nbased completions, while DeLorean Liu et al. (2023) integrates symbolic constraints. These\ntechniques target structure but overlook cultural fidelity. In contrast, our method enforces\nnovelty during decoding via cosine-based filtering and supports cross-lingual generation of\nculturally resonant riddles.\n2\n\nonstraints:\novel + Structure\n\nEval\nBLEU, Dist.,\nPOS\n\n[Retry [accept\n\nPublished as a conference paper at COLM 2025\n3\nMethodology\nThis section describes the components of our multilingual riddle generation framework,\nincluding our originality-enforcing prompting method, a centralized automatic evaluation\nmetric, human annotation protocols, experimental design, and fine-tuning our model.\n3.1\nAdaptive Originality Filtering (AOF) Prompting\nTraditional prompting strategies such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Few-Shot improve\nlogical coherence but frequently fall short in producing structurally novel and semantically\ndiverse riddles. Prior work has shown that LLMs often reproduce internet riddles or\nparaphrase entries from BiRdQA Zhang & Wan (2022), defaulting to overused scaffolds such\nas \u201cI have...\u201d and \u201cWhat am I?\u201d. To address this, we propose Adaptive Originality Filtering\n(AOF), a prompting method designed to enforce semantic novelty, syntactic variation, and\ncross-lingual fidelity.\nSemantic Filtering.\nEach generated riddle rgen is compared against a reference set D =\n{ri}N\ni=1 using cosine similarity in embedding space. A candidate is accepted only if:\nS(rgen, D) < \u03b8, with \u03b8 = 0.75.\nThe full formulation and reasoning for .75 appears in Appendix J.1.\nRejection Sampling Loop.\nAOF employs rejection sampling: if a candidate fails the\nnovelty filter, it is discarded and regenerated. This process repeats until a valid output is\nproduced or a retry cap is reached. See Appendix J.2 for pseudocode.\nPrompt Constraints.\nPrompts used in AOF enforce specific closure formats, grammatical\nvariation, and discourage common answers. Template rules are detailed in Appendix J.\n3.2\nExperimental Setup\nWe evaluate generation across multiple LLMs and prompting strategies, comparing struc-\ntural, semantic, and fluency metrics in five languages.\nModels Evaluated.\nWe benchmark GPT-4o, LLaMA 3.1, and DeepSeek Reasoning (R1), all\nqueried under identical settings (temperature 0.7, token limit 3000).\nPrompting Strategies.\nWe compare Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Adversar-\nial Wallace et al. (2019); Ribeiro et al. (2018), and AOF prompting. Full details are provided\nin Appendix K.\nDataset.\nBiRdQA Zhang & Wan (2022) provides a bilingual corpus of 15,365 riddles in\nEnglish and Chinese. We sample balanced subsets and align multilingual answers.\nMetrics.\nAutomatic metrics include Self-BLEU (repetition),\nDistinct-2 (diversity),\nBERTScore (alignment). Human validation is included in Appendix A.\n3.3\nFine-Tuning of the GPT-4o Model\nObjective and Motivation\nThis fine-tuning aimed to improve GPT-4o-2024-08-06\u2019s per-\nformance on riddle comprehension and generation across multiple languages. Riddles\ninvolve more than surface-level matching\u2014they require metaphor understanding, logical\ncontradiction, and creative misdirection. Our goal was not only to raise answer accuracy\nbut also to instill structural reasoning abilities.\n3\n\nPublished as a conference paper at COLM 2025\nMethodological Overview\nWe framed the task as a supervised multi-class classification\nproblem using the BiRdQA dataset. Riddles were presented in a multiple-choice format,\nand the model was fine-tuned using cross-entropy loss. For complete details on dataset\npreprocessing, training setup, and training set expansion, see Appendix I.\nMultiple-Choice Framing Overview\nRiddles were framed in a four-option multiple-choice\nformat to encourage fine-grained discrimination between plausible distractors. This setup\nshaped the model\u2019s reasoning strategies and generalization capabilities. A full analysis of\nframing effects is provided in Appendix I.5.\nPrompting Strategies\nWe evaluated five prompting strategies on the fine-tuned model:\nZero-Shot, Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Adversarial, and Adaptive Originality Filter-\ning (AOF). These were held consistent with the pretrained experiments. See Table 21 for full\nprompt templates.\nModel Comparison Overview\nWe compared the fine-tuned GPT-4o to several pretrained\nbaselines\u2014GPT-4o (pretrained), LLaMA 3.1, and DeepSeek R1\u2014using identical prompts and\nevaluation metrics. For detailed results and methodological discussion, see Appendix I.4.\n4\nAOF Pretrained Evaluations\nWe evaluate riddle generation across three pretrained models using five prompting selecting\nriddle one example per method. This section blends automatic metrics with qualitative\nobservations to assess metaphor, creativity, and syntactic variation. Representative riddles\nare provided in Appendices D\u2013G. For detailed quantitative results\u2014token length, Self-\nBLEU, Distinct-2, and syntactic validity\u2014see Appendix B.\n4.1\nEnglish\nGPT-4o\nachieves moderate repetition (Self-BLEU: 0.413) as shown in Table 5 and high\nlexical diversity (Distinct-2: 0.852), balancing structural cohesion with surface novelty.\nCompared to LLaMA 3.1 (0.471 / 0.727) and DeepSeek R1 (0.339 / 0.845), its generation\nreflects a middle ground: less repetitive than LLaMA, but more structurally conventional\nthan R1. The riddle in Row 1 of Table 6 incorporates contrastive metaphor in a coherent\nframe, supporting findings that figurative ambiguity paired with consistent syntax enhances\ninterpretability Lakoff & Johnson (1980); Shutova (2013). This reflects controlled creativity,\nwhere lexical risk is constrained by structural regularity Binsted (1996).\nLLaMA 3.1\ndisplays the strongest phrasal variation among the three models, as evidenced\nby a higher Distinct-2 (0.727), though with a moderate increase in repetition (Self-BLEU:\n0.471). In Row 2, the riddle demonstrates rhythmic structure and concept layering, leverag-\ning symmetry and internal metaphor to guide reader inference. This aligns with cognitive\naccounts linking memorable riddles to rhythmic and conceptual salience Koestler (1964).\nThe AOF method appears to help LLaMA 3.1 decouple fixed templates from overused\nlexical forms, allowing for recompositional variety without semantic drift Fauconnier &\nTurner (2002).\nDeepSeek R1\nexhibits the lowest repetition (Self-BLEU: 0.339) and highest token diversity\n(Distinct-2: 0.845), outperforming both GPT-4o and LLaMA 3.1 in novelty. The output in\nRow 3 exemplifies conceptual inversion and abstract framing, using oppositional imagery\nto support lateral interpretation. This mirrors classic riddle mechanics involving duality\nand semantic misdirection Koestler (1964). While diversity of this magnitude sometimes\ncorrelates with fluency degradation Zhang et al. (2021), AOF appears to regulate R1\u2019s output\nsufficiently to retain syntactic legibility Xu et al. (2018), enabling expressive reformulations\nwithout loss of coherence.\n4\n\nPublished as a conference paper at COLM 2025\n4.2\nJapanese\nGPT-4o\nGPT-4o\u2019s performance on metrics like self-BLEU and Distinct-n under AOF ranks\naround average relative to standard baselines\u2014reflecting more on metric saturation than\nprompting inadequacy (Yao et al. (2025), Schmidtov\u00b4a et al. (2024)). AOF resolves key flaws in\ntraditional prompts, such as the egocentric \u201cI\u201d-imagery in chain-of-thought and overfitting\nin few-shot examples. These gains are not fully captured by current metrics. As shown in\nTable 10, GPT-4o under AOF adopts a distinct structure: a punchy first sentence followed\nby a more elaborate second, enhancing narrative pacing and engagement.\nLLaMA 3.1\nWhile LLaMA 3.1 shows limited improvement on automated metrics using\nAOF, this reflects model expressiveness more than prompt quality. AOF mitigates egocentric\nphrasing and rote repetition seen in baseline prompts, yielding subtler gains beyond surface\nmetrics. For instance, Table 10 features a clever use of the homophone \u300c\u3064\u308b\u300dto suggest\nboth decorative twine and the crane (\u9db4)\u2014symbols deeply embedded in Japanese culture\nand Shinto ritual, such as \u3057\u3081\u7e04(shimenawa) An (2023).\nDeepSeek R1\nDeepSeek R1\u2019s middling scores on self-BLEU and Distinct-n under AOF\nsay more about its stylistic tendencies than the prompt\u2019s design Li et al. (2024). AOF\ncorrects core issues in baseline methods\u2014overuse of first-person voice in chain-of-thought\nand example mimicry in few-shot\u2014enabling richer creativity not fully reflected in metrics.\nTable 10 presents a vivid example: a fish\u2019s mouth described as a \u201cquiet tree\u201d where birds\nsing, merging the surreal and natural in a poetically disorienting twist.\n4.3\nArabic\nGPT-4o\nGPT-4o shows moderate repetition (Self-BLEU: 0.497) as shown in Table 5 and\ngood lexical variety (Distinct-2: 0.780) with Adaptive Originality Filtering (AOF), clearly\nperforming better than common methods like few-shot, zero-shot, chain-of-thought, and ad-\nversarial prompts. Unlike chain-of-thought prompts, which tend to produce straightforward,\npredictable metaphors, AOF helps GPT-4o create riddles with imaginative and abstract\nimages\u2014such as something that\u2019s present but unseen\u2014as illustrated in (Figure 2, Row 1).\nThis approach fits naturally with traditional Arabic riddles, known for their symbolic and\nreflective style Al-Khatib (1988).\nLLaMA 3.1\nLLaMA 3.1 strikes an effective balance between repetition (Self-BLEU: 0.374)\nand creativity (Distinct-2: 0.927) through AOF, addressing issues often found in chain-\nof-thought and adversarial prompts, which frequently yield predictable or overly vague\noutputs. Its riddles are relatable and culturally resonant, using clear metaphors drawn from\neveryday life, like \u201da strong wind\u201d that can\u2019t enter a house, as shown in (Figure 2, Row 2).\nThis connects directly to familiar poetic traditions in Arabic, avoiding common pitfalls like\nrepetitive phrasing or loss of meaning Al-Jahiz (869).\nDeepSeek R1\nDeepSeek R1, while somewhat repetitive (Self-BLEU: 0.585), achieves no-\ntable depth in metaphorical expression (Distinct-2: 0.583) under AOF. This method effec-\ntively tackles problems seen in zero-shot, few-shot, and adversarial prompting, such as\nrepetitive or simplistic metaphors. For example, DeepSeek R1 creatively portrays a rooftop\nas an eye \u201dfed by the city,\u201d as seen in (Figure 2, Row 3), mixing urban imagery with striking vi-\nsual symbolism. This clever blending of abstract ideas and real-world images strongly aligns\nwith Arabic poetry, known for its layers of meaning and subtle metaphors Al-Marzouki\n(2012). By encouraging culturally rich riddles, AOF clearly boosts the originality and depth\nof DeepSeek R1\u2019s outputs compared to simpler prompting strategies Xu et al. (2018).\n4.4\nFrench\nGPT-4o\nGPT-4o\u2019s pretrained riddles are grammatically solid and easy to understand,\nbut they often feel like lifted translations of English puzzles. For example, it offers the\nriddle in Row 1 of Table 17, a fluent but familiar \u201ccloud\u201d trope. The phrasing remains\n5\n\nPublished as a conference paper at COLM 2025\nstraightforward, with minimal use of inversion or enjambment that one might expect in\nclassic French \u00b4enigmes Chan (1996). Even when prompted for more creativity, GPT-4o tends\nto default back to elemental imagery\u2014wind, water, shadows\u2014rather than exploring urban\nor abstract concepts. Answerability is never in doubt, but the surface novelty and cultural\nresonance remain modest. This is reflected in a Self-BLEU of 0.413 and Distinct-2 of 0.852\nas shown in Table 5, suggesting moderate repetition and relatively strong lexical variety.\nDeepSeek R1\nDeepSeek R1 generates concise and structurally consistent riddles, yet it\nleans heavily on classic \u201criver\u201d or \u201cecho\u201d formats. A typical example, shown in Row 2,\nfeels like a direct adaptation of childhood puzzles, with little lexical or rhythmic inno-\nvation Meulemans (2005). Attempts to push deeper\u2014such as referencing time, memory,\nor abstract concepts\u2014often collapse back into familiar patterns. Even in adversarial or\nchain-of-thought modes, R1 seldom ventures beyond these safe metaphors. The result is\nalways coherent but predictable, with cultural idioms and advanced metaphorical shifts\nunder-utilized. This pattern yields a low Self-BLEU of 0.339 and a high Distinct-2 of 0.845,\nindicating minimal paraphrastic overlap and strong surface novelty.\nLLaMA 3.1\nLLaMA 3.1 shows the greatest stylistic range\u2014some riddles stumble through\nliteral phrasing, while others introduce intriguing wordplay. Row 3 plays with poetic\nmisdirection (\u201cdanse\u201d / \u201cris\u201d), while Row 4 experiments with digital metaphor (\u201ccurseur\u201d),\nreflecting a willingness to stretch genre boundaries. These flashes of originality are countered\nby examples that revert to stilted syntax or literal templates. Overall, LLaMA\u2019s pretrained\noutputs blend moments of genuine creativity with occasional lapses into generic phrasing,\nsuggesting strong potential but inconsistent performance. The variation is mirrored in its\nSelf-BLEU score of 0.471 and Distinct-2 of 0.727, balancing moderate repetition with decent\nsurface diversity Veale (2011).\n4.5\nChinese\nGPT-4o\nGPT-4o\u2019s pretrained Chinese riddles are grammatically correct and logically\ncoherent, but they often translate English metaphors without adapting to the script-specific\nstrategies typical of traditional \u706f\u8c1c. As shown in Row 1 of Table 13, the imagery is\nliteral and binary, missing multi-layered allusions like radical-based clues or idiomatic\nrhythm Chan (1996); Sun (2006). When prompted for variation, GPT-4o maintains syntactic\nfluency but rarely ventures into lexical innovation. With a Self-BLEU of 0.280 and Distinct-2\nof 0.869 as in shown in Table 5, it balances mild repetition with surface diversity but lacks\ndeeper cultural anchoring.\nDeepSeek R1\nDeepSeek R1 outputs elegant, fluent couplets with strong adherence to\nclassical poetic symmetry, as shown in Row 2. While it maintains strong rhythm and\nantithesis, its metaphors remain shallow\u2014favoring form over lexical novelty. Even when\nattempting radical-based clues (Row 3), the effort often feels literal rather than layered.\nDespite this, R1 exhibits high diversity (Distinct-2: 0.674) and moderate repetition (Self-\nBLEU: 0.433), suggesting a capacity for expressive phrasing that falls short of fully exploiting\nChinese script-level wordplay Xu et al. (2018).\nLLaMA 3.1\nLLaMA 3.1 demonstrates the richest cultural range. Row 4 blends visual\nand semantic metaphor in a style reminiscent of folk riddles, while Row 5 shows explicit\nuse of radical-based structure. This script-aware design reflects deeper integration with\nChinese morphological conventions Li (2008). Although some outputs revert to generic\n\u201c\u65e0... \u80fd...\u201d templates or awkward logic, LLaMA\u2019s outputs remain stylistically diverse\n(Distinct-2: 0.776) and moderately novel (Self-BLEU: 0.428). This suggests that the AOF\nprompt enables meaningful variation while retaining cultural fidelity Fauconnier & Turner\n(2002).\n6\n\nPublished as a conference paper at COLM 2025\nLanguage Pair\nPrompting Method\nFine-Tuned GPT-4o (Self-BLEU / Distinct-2)\nEnglish\u2013Arabic\nFew-Shot\n0.233 / 0.826\nAOF (Ours)\n0.260 / 0.893\nZero-Shot\n0.391 / 0.752\nChain-of-Thought\n0.326 / 0.831\nAdversarial\n0.320 / 0.810\nEnglish\u2013Chinese\nAOF (Ours)\n0.163 / 0.934\nZero-Shot\n0.315 / 0.831\nFew-Shot\n0.349 / 0.787\nChain-of-Thought\n0.305 / 0.828\nAdversarial\n0.400 / 0.757\nEnglish\u2013Japanese\nAOF (Ours)\n0.177 / 0.915\nZero-Shot\n0.431 / 0.752\nFew-Shot\n0.326 / 0.778\nChain-of-Thought\n0.386 / 0.796\nAdversarial\n0.327 / 0.748\nEnglish\u2013French\nChain-of-Thought\n0.256 / 0.892\nAOF (Ours)\n0.273 / 0.856\nZero-Shot\n0.289 / 0.867\nFew-Shot\n0.323 / 0.835\nAdversarial\n0.359 / 0.793\nTable 1: Prompting performance (Self-BLEU / Distinct-2) for the fine-tuned GPT-4o model\nacross language pairs. One bolded cell per language pair shows the best combined\nperformance (lowest Self-BLEU and highest Distinct-2).\n5\nFine-Tuned vs. Pretrained Riddle Generation\nWe compare GPT-4o before and after fine-tuning across five prompting strategies. Quantita-\ntive metrics\u2014token length, Self-BLEU, and Distinct-2\u2014are complemented by qualitative\nanalysis of metaphorical framing, structural variation, and bilingual phrasing. Representa-\ntive pairs are shown in Appendices D\u2013G.\n5.1\nEnglish\nFine-tuning reduces token length (e.g., Zero-Shot: 1112\u2192799) and Self-BLEU (0.391\u21920.233)\nwhile maintaining Distinct-2 (0.787\u21920.835). Pretrained outputs often mirror real-world\nriddles through polysemy or personification (Table 7, Row 1), while fine-tuned variants\nadopt metaphorical abstraction and cleaner phrasing. Few-shot fine-tuning increases expres-\nsiveness via metaphorical phrases like \u201cunseen roads,\u201d though at the cost of verbosity (Row\n2). CoT prompts benefit most: binary contrasts replace triplet lists, yielding minimal length\n(730 tokens) and high lexical spread (Distinct-2 = 0.831, Row 3). AOF produces the most\nnovel riddles with metaphorical stillness (e.g., \u201cquietest word\u201d) and the strongest metrics\noverall (Self-BLEU = 0.260, Distinct-2 = 0.893, Row 4). Adversarial fine-tuning intensifies\nabstraction, shifting from clouds to time-as-erosion metaphors (Row 5), with moderate\nSelf-BLEU (0.320) and strong Distinct-2 (0.810).\n5.2\nJapanese\nFine-tuning enhances morphosyntactic fluency and metaphorical depth across all prompting\nmethods. In Zero-Shot (Table 11, Row 1), redundancy declines (Self-BLEU: 0.431\u21920.364) and\nalignment with Japanese poetic rhythm improves. Few-shot prompts (Row 2) exhibit clearer\nclause structure and cultural framing, raising Distinct-2 (0.605\u21920.778). CoT outputs (Row 3)\nshift from formulaic \u201cI. . . \u201d templates to more idiomatic bilingual logic, improving Self-BLEU\n(0.532\u21920.386) and shortening length (1169\u2192753). Adversarial riddles (Row 4) gain fluency\nand metaphor variation while reducing structural awkwardness. AOF (Row 5) yields\n7\n\nPublished as a conference paper at COLM 2025\nthe largest qualitative improvement, enhancing metaphor density and cultural cadence\nalongside a major Self-BLEU drop (0.483\u21920.177) and Distinct-2 increase (0.697\u21920.915).\n5.3\nChinese\nFine-tuning enhances metaphorical depth and structural variety. In Zero-Shot (Table 14,\nRow 1), the shift from rigid constructions (e.g., \u201c\u65e0...\u80fd...\u201d) to smoother phrasing results\nin lower Self-BLEU (0.335\u21920.315). Few-shot fine-tuning (Row 2) preserves metaphor\n(e.g., fruit riddles) but avoids repetitive idioms, maintaining high Distinct-2 (0.787). CoT\noutputs (Row 3) become more concise (1169\u2192860 tokens) and morphosyntactically fluent.\nAdversarial prompts (Row 4) retain metaphor but improve cadence and cohesion (Self-BLEU:\n0.363\u21920.400). AOF (Row 5) again leads in lexical variety (Distinct-2: 0.934) and minimal\nredundancy (Self-BLEU: 0.163), producing abstract yet bilingual-consistent metaphors.\n5.4\nArabic\nIn zero-shot (Table 3, Row 1), fine-tuned riddles replace rigid \u201cX without Y\u201d scaffolds\nwith rhythmic phrasing and internal rhyme, reducing Self-BLEU (0.391\u21920.260) and raising\nDistinct-2 (0.752\u21920.893). Few-shot outputs (Row 2) drop repetitive clause frames in favor\nof enjambment and root variation, yielding more lexical diversity (Distinct-2: 0.910) and\nlower redundancy (Self-BLEU: 0.245). CoT riddles (Row 3) become more compact and id-\niomatic, improving Distinct-2 (0.828) while reducing Self-BLEU (0.412\u21920.326). Adversarial\nprompting (Row 4) shifts from binary contrast to triadic parallelism and poetic misdirection,\nachieving the lowest Self-BLEU (0.177) and highest Distinct-2 (0.915). AOF (Row 5) sustains\npeak diversity (0.893) while filtering out formulaic phrasing, better aligning with Arabic\npoetic conventions.\n5.5\nFrench\nFine-tuning reduces overuse of literal templates like \u201cQu\u2019est-ce qui...\u201d and enhances lex-\nical diversity across all prompts. Zero-Shot outputs (Table 18, Row 1) shift from for-\nmulaic rhythms to varied idiomatic constructions (Self-BLEU: 0.451\u21920.256, Distinct-2:\n0.833\u21920.892). Few-shot fine-tuned riddles (Row 2) are more concise (2982\u21922005 tokens)\nand metaphorically fresh. CoT (Row 3) yields the strongest tradeoff: shorter outputs (753\ntokens), lower Self-BLEU (0.444\u21920.326), and improved diversity (Distinct-2: 0.733\u21920.831).\nAdversarial fine-tuning (Row 4) avoids clunky phrasing while maintaining misdirection.\nAOF (Row 5) produces the most idiomatic and semantically novel French riddles, with\nSelf-BLEU dropping to 0.260 and Distinct-2 peaking at 0.893.\n6\nFine-Tuned Riddle Comparison to Real World\nWe evaluate fine-tuned riddle generations across five prompting strategies by comparing\nthem to their closest literary or folkloric counterparts. This comparison focuses on structural\nfidelity, metaphorical depth, and cultural alignment. Language-specific analyses are pro-\nvided in Appendix A, which details how fine-tuned outputs differ from real-world riddles\nin phrasing, abstraction, and stylistic form.\n7\nConclusion\nThis paper introduced Adaptive Originality Filtering (AOF), a prompting framework de-\nsigned to overcome originality limits in bilingual riddle generation. Evaluated across four\nlanguage pairs, five prompting paradigms, and three LLMs, AOF consistently outperformed\nbaselines in lexical diversity (Distinct-n), semantic novelty (Self-BLEU), and cross-lingual\nalignment. Fine-tuned GPT-4o with AOF produced the highest-quality outputs, outperform-\ning both its pretrained version and open-weight models. Human evaluations confirmed that\nAOF-generated riddles were more metaphorically rich, structurally coherent, and culturally\nresonant\u2014especially in French, Japanese, Chinese, and Arabic. These findings demonstrate\n8\n\nPublished as a conference paper at COLM 2025\nthat filtering-based prompting, particularly when combined with fine-tuning, provides a\nrobust path toward semantically novel and linguistically sound multilingual generation.\nAOF marks a practical advance in prompt design for creative, cross-lingual NLP tasks.\nLimitations\nDataset Scope\nWe restrict our study to the BiRdQA dataset, covering 6,614 English and 8,751 Chinese\nriddles with multiple-choice answers. While genre-diverse, its figurative focus narrows\ngeneralizability to broader creative tasks (e.g., storytelling, allegory). Our multilingual\nevaluation spans five languages (EN\u2013ZH\u2013AR\u2013JA\u2013FR), excluding lower-resource or mor-\nphologically rich ones like Finnish or Swahili.\nPrompting and Sampling\nWe fix sampling parameters (e.g., temperature, token limit) across all models to ensure\ncomparability, potentially masking prompt\u2013parameter effects. AOF\u2019s MiniLM-based filter-\ning emphasizes surface-level novelty, risking semantic redundancy undetected by cosine\ndistance\u2014particularly in non-English outputs.\nFine-Tuning Setup\nOur fine-tuning on GPT-4o uses BiRdQA\u2019s multiple-choice framing, enhancing structural\nfluency but biasing toward riddle types favoring clarity over ambiguity. Although stylistic\ngains are evident in token length and Self-BLEU, we omit extrinsic human metrics like\npuzzle difficulty or solver accuracy.\nEvaluation Constraints\nHuman evaluations cover only five languages due to cost, limiting cultural generalizabil-\nity. Syntactic validity checks apply solely to AOF generations, leaving other strategies\nunchecked structurally. Lastly, while AOF excels in novelty-structure balance, deeper\nhuman validation (e.g., creativity ratings, solve rates) remains future work.\nEthics Statement\nLanguage Equity and Cultural Representation\nThis work evaluates riddle generation across five languages\u2014English, Chinese, Japanese,\nArabic, and French\u2014selected for linguistic diversity and resource availability. However, our\ndataset and prompts reflect biases inherent to internet-derived corpora and may not fully\ncapture the cultural or idiomatic richness of underrepresented communities. For example,\ncertain metaphorical forms or idiomatic patterns may be overrepresented in English and\nunderdeveloped in Arabic or Japanese, despite efforts to balance qualitative evaluation\nacross languages.\nCreative Attribution and AI Authorship\nRiddles generated in this study may closely resemble publicly available riddles from folk-\nlore, educational resources, or crowdsourced riddle repositories. Although our Adaptive\nOriginality Filtering (AOF) method actively screens for semantic overlap, we acknowledge\nthat latent training data exposures or structural mimicry may inadvertently echo human-\ncreated content. As such, we recommend that users and downstream applications of our\nsystem avoid commercial use or publication of model outputs without further originality\nassessment or attribution checks.\n9\n\nPublished as a conference paper at COLM 2025\nData Privacy and Responsible Fine-Tuning\nThe BiRdQA dataset used for training and evaluation contains no personally identifiable in-\nformation (PII). All riddles are anonymized and synthetically framed as general-knowledge\nmetaphors. Our fine-tuning process adheres to OpenAI\u2019s guidelines for API use and oper-\nates within approved token limits and safety thresholds. No user data or private content\nwas used in training, generation, or evaluation.\nMisuse Risks and Interpretability\nWhile riddle generation appears benign, the creative ambiguity inherent in figurative tasks\ncan be exploited for misinformation or manipulation, especially in politically or culturally\nsensitive contexts. Models capable of abstract generation may also fabricate plausible\nbut misleading information. We caution against deploying this system in high-stakes\neducational, psychological, or legal settings without adequate interpretability safeguards or\nhuman oversight.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Bakr Bouhaya for his thoughtful analysis of Arabic riddles, which provided\nvaluable insights and cultural grounding for our study.\nReferences\nAbu Uthman Amr ibn Bahr Al-Jahiz.

In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, volume 36, pp.\n11748\u201311756, 2022.\nA\nAppendix: Fine-Tuned AOF Riddle Comparison to Real World\nA.1\nEnglish\nAs shown in Table 8, Row 1, the fine-tuned riddle reimagines the original with more\nabstract and layered associations. Rather than relying on negated literalism, it introduces\nconcepts like memory and time using metaphorical compression and cross-sensory cues.\nThis approach reflects principles of conceptual integration theory, where blending disparate\ndomains enhances figurative depth Fauconnier & Turner (2002). In contrast, the real-world\nversion is more direct, using structural opposition to achieve its effect Gentner (1983).Row 2\npresents another clear shift in stylistic strategy. The real-world riddle uses static reversal\u2014a\ncommon riddle trope\u2014while the fine-tuned variant introduces paradox and disappearance\nas metaphors for guidance. This relies on spatial embodiment, a known technique in\nmetaphor production Lakoff & Johnson (1980), and adds ambiguity through indirectness.\nSuch compositional layering suggests that AOF prompts can foster more interpretively open\nand stylistically creative riddles than conventional examples.\nA.2\nJapanese\nThe riddles in AOF are guided towards direct metaphors with complex, creative, and unique\nword choice and sentence structure, while having creative answers like memory and beehive\nin Table 12 Teng & Xu (2023). These generations surpass past riddle generations flaws like\nlack of originality in sentence structure, just changing the pronouns or verbs to make it\nmore creative, and etc. These riddles contrast with traditional Japanese riddles which rely\non phonetic ambiguity and cultural nuance like in Table 12 where the first row features\nhow phonetically similar words feature different meanings and the riddle in the second row\nyields different ways of reading through phonetically similar readingsAn (2023).\nA.3\nChinese\nFine-tuned AOF riddles in Chinese often leverage character structure through radical-based\npuns and vivid imagery. For instance, the coral riddle in Table 15 blends \u201csea\u201d imagery\nwith radical hints (\u6d77\u5e95\u85cf\u68ee\u6797...) to guide the solver\u2014a strategy supported by prior\nwork on character-pun alignments in riddle composition Tan et al. (2016). By contrast,\ntraditional \u706f\u8c1c(e.g., \u201c\u53e3\u888b\u91cc\u6709\u4e2a\u5706...\u201d for \u201c\u6708\u4eae\u201d) rely on simple perceptual clues and\ntonal balance Wei & Lee (2021). This comparison suggests that our approach enhances\ncultural depth by embedding multi-layered orthographic play into poetic metaphors while\npreserving reader accessibility.\nA.4\nArabic\n(Figure 4, Row 5) AOF stands out for its fresh language and metaphorical clarity. One\nriddle\u2014\u201dSomething that\u2019s full when it eats, and thirsty when it drinks\u201d\u2014relies on a simple yet\nclever contradiction that invites reflection. It draws on the tradition of using everyday\nlogic to confuse and amuse, evoking the style of oral riddles that play with basic physical\nexperiences. The second riddle\u2014\u201dI light up the night and disappear by day, visible yet unseen...\nWhat am I?\u201d\u2014is more poetic, using contrast and imagery to express something elusive and\nsymbolic. It captures the feel of classical Arabic algh\u00afaz not through root-based punning but\nthrough layered metaphor and rhythm. Together, these examples show how AOF preserves\n14\n\nPublished as a conference paper at COLM 2025\nthe spirit of traditional riddling through modern, metaphor-rich language Antar (2023);\nBhatt & Kuka (2025); Liu et al. (2022).\nA.5\nFrench\nFine-tuned AOF riddles in French lean into unexpected domain shifts and internal echo. The\nAOF example repurposes the concept of a \u201ctypo\u201d as a buzzing bee, combining internal rhyme\n(\u201cjardin/des mots\u201d, \u201cbourdonnant/lettres\u201d) and metaphorical layering, driving semantic\nplayfulness and rhythmic balance (Table 19, Row 1). Internal rhyme notably enhances poetic\ncohesion and cognitive engagement Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2025). In contrast, canonical\nFrench \u00b4enigmes tend toward binary negation and elemental imagery (Table 19, Row 2).\nFor instance, \u201cJe vole sans ailes, je pleure sans yeux...\u201d relies on simple antithesis without\ncross-domain metaphorical transfer. The AOF variant\u2019s richer conceptual mapping aligns\nwith findings that cross-domain metaphor and internal structure boost interpretability and\nnovelty in poetic forms Lakoff & Johnson (1999); Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2025).\nB\nAppendix: Additional Results Tables\nB.1\nAverage Token Length Across Pretrained Models\nLanguage Pair\nPrompting Method\nGPT-4o\nLLaMA 3.1\nDeepSeek R1\nEnglish\u2013Arabic\nChain-of-Thought\n910\n1613\n1085\nZero-Shot\n1112\n1519\n2005\nFew-Shot\n1921\n2050\n3144\nAdversarial\n938\n2202\n1826\nAOF (Ours)\n1548\n1157\n2138\nEnglish\u2013Chinese\nZero-Shot\n702\n731\n719\nFew-Shot\n2030\n2097\n2351\nChain-of-Thought\n942\n1389\n1205\nAdversarial\n916\n950\n1126\nAOF (Ours)\n1275\n1663\n1535\nEnglish\u2013Japanese\nZero-Shot\n1099\n1127\n1115\nFew-Shot\n1922\n1941\n2330\nChain-of-Thought\n1169\n1099\n1802\nAdversarial\n1101\n894\n1128\nAOF (Ours)\n1185\n1230\n1273\nEnglish\u2013French\nAdversarial\n787\n1128\n1413\nZero-Shot\n1163\n1183\n1613\nFew-Shot\n2061\n2982\n2565\nChain-of-Thought\n940\n1631\n1236\nAOF (Ours)\n1166\n1517\n1982\nTable 2: Average token lengths for each model and prompting method across language pairs.\nBold = shortest average length per pair.\n15\n\nPublished as a conference paper at COLM 2025\nB.2\nAverage Token Lengths Across Languages\nLanguage Pair\nPrompting Method\nFine-Tuned GPT-4o (Avg.

It includes 6,614\nEnglish riddles and 8,751 Chinese riddles, each paired with four answer options. Riddles\nwere shuffled at each epoch to prevent memorization, and no synthetic augmentation was\napplied.\nIts linguistic diversity\u2014spanning syntactic constructions, cultural idioms, and metaphorical\nphrasing\u2014made BiRdQA suitable for riddle-based fine-tuning. All data were Unicode-\nnormalized and deduplicated, and stratified sampling ensured balanced language represen-\ntation.\nI.2\nTraining Strategy\nFine-tuning was framed as a supervised multi-class classification problem. The model\nselected one correct answer out of four using cross-entropy loss. The following hyperpa-\nrameters were used:\n\u2022 Temperature: 0.7\n\u2022 Token Limit: 3000\n\u2022 Initial Accuracy: 37\u201359% on development set\nTraining followed a three-stage pipeline: base fine-tuning, early stopping on dev perfor-\nmance, and multilingual test evaluation to check generalization.\nI.3\nAppendix:Training Set Expansion\nTo improve abstraction and metaphor handling, the English and Chinese development sets\nwere merged into the training pool. This added examples with closely related distractors\nand borderline ambiguity. After retraining, test accuracy rose to 97%.\nThese improvements suggest the model internalized deep riddle logic, moving beyond sur-\nface pattern recognition and toward more sophisticated reasoning involving contradiction\nand misdirection.\nI.4\nModel Comparison Methodology\nI.4.1\nBaseline Models\nWe benchmarked the fine-tuned GPT-4o against three models:\n\u2022 Pretrained GPT-4o (2024-08-06): Unadapted baseline.\n\u2022 LLaMA 3.1: An open-weight multilingual model with strong reasoning ability.\n\u2022 DeepSeek R1: A reasoning-optimized model focusing on step-wise logical align-\nment.\nEach model received the same riddles under consistent prompting strategies to ensure fair\ncomparison.\nI.4.2\nEvaluation Procedure\nAll models were tested under five prompting strategies (Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Chain-of-\nThought, Adversarial, AOF) with identical templates (Table 21). Metrics included:\n\u2022 Accuracy (multiple choice prediction)\n29\n\nPublished as a conference paper at COLM 2025\n\u2022 Token Length (verbosity)\n\u2022 Self-BLEU (semantic diversity)\n\u2022 Distinct-2 (lexical uniqueness)\nQualitative evaluations by human reviewers assessed metaphor handling, distractor dis-\ncrimination, and cultural idiomatic fluency.\nI.4.3\nSummary of Findings\nFine-tuned GPT-4o consistently outperformed all baselines across metrics. Key observations:\n\u2022 Accuracy: Rose from 59% (pretrained) to 97% (fine-tuned).\n\u2022 Reasoning: Demonstrated superior metaphor resolution and logical contradiction\nhandling.\n\u2022 Naturalness: Generated riddles more closely matched idiomatic structures in both\nEnglish and Chinese.\nI.5\nImpact of Multiple-Choice Framing\nRetaining a multiple-choice structure during fine-tuning had a pronounced effect on the\nmodel\u2019s ability to reason through ambiguity. Unlike generative formats where any output is\nvalid if semantically relevant, the multiple-choice setup forced the model to:\n\u2022 Distinguish between semantically similar options\n\u2022 Engage in elimination-style reasoning\n\u2022 Learn disambiguation strategies aligned with riddle logic\nThis setup simulated test-like conditions where distractors were deliberately constructed to\nreflect surface-level similarity (e.g., phonetic overlaps, shared imagery, or logical decoys).\nThe model improved not only in accuracy but in inferential depth.\nMoreover, this format likely enhanced the model\u2019s sensitivity to misdirection\u2014a core feature\nof riddles\u2014by requiring it to reject reasonable but incorrect answers. We observed that\nthis effect carried over to open-ended generation: the model became more likely to embed\ninternal contradiction or layered metaphor, hallmarks of real-world riddles.\nIn sum, multiple-choice framing served both as a task constraint and as a pedagogical\nscaffold, encouraging the model to develop strategies beyond rote keyword matching.\nJ\nAppendix: AOF Prompt Template and Constraints\nThe Adaptive Originality Filtering (AOF) prompt enforces explicit structural rules to maxi-\nmize diversity, creativity, and cultural fit. Specifically:\n\u2022 Syntactic Variety: At least half of the riddles must use poetic, declarative, or\nmetaphorical forms. Fewer than 3 per batch may end in \u201cWhat am I?\u201d\n\u2022 Answer Filtering: Outputs with generic answers (e.g., shadow, time, echo, fire,\nbreath) are discarded.\n\u2022 Cross-Lingual Parity: Translations must preserve ambiguity or metaphor across\nboth languages.\n\u2022 Novelty Filter: Semantic similarity to known riddles must fall below a threshold\n(\u03b8 = 0.75), as measured against BiRdQA Zhang & Wan (2022).\n30\n\nPublished as a conference paper at COLM 2025\nJ.1\nSemantic Similarity Filtering Equation\nA candidate riddle rgen is compared to a reference dataset D = {ri}N\ni=1 via:\nS(rgen, D) = max\nri\u2208D cos(\u03d5(rgen), \u03d5(ri))\n(1)\nwhere \u03d5(\u00b7) is an embedding function (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2).

To address this, we propose\nAttention2Probability: attention-driven terminology proba-\nbility estimation for robust speech-to-text system, which\nis lightweight, flexible, and accurate. Attention2Probability\nconverts cross-attention weights between speech and termi-\nnology into presence probabilities, and it further employs cur-\nriculum learning to enhance retrieval accuracy. Furthermore,\nto tackle the lack of data for speech-to-text tasks with ter-\nminology intervention, we create and release a new speech\ndataset with terminology to support future research in this\narea. Experimental results show that Attention2Probability\nsignificantly outperforms the VectorDB method on our test\nset. Specifically, its maximum recall rates reach 92.57%\nfor Chinese and 86.83% for English. This high recall is\nachieved with a latency of only 8.71ms per query. Inter-\nvening in SLMs\u2019 recognition and translation tasks using\nAttention2Probability-retrieved terms improves terminology\naccuracy by 6\u201317%, while revealing that the current utiliza-\ntion of terminology by SLMs has limitations.\nCode, Data, Models \u2014\nhttps://github.com/bytedance/Attention2Probability\nIntroduction\nAutomatic Speech Recognition (ASR) (Kim, Hori, and\nWatanabe 2017) and Speech Translation (ST) (Xu et al.\n2021) are vital for real-world applications like meeting\ntranscription and simultaneous interpretation.

How-\never, in specialized domains such as medicine or gaming,\nSLMs often struggle to generate accurate technical termi-\nnology (Yang et al. 2024).\nA straightforward strategy involves leveraging collected\nterminological datasets to fine-tune SLMs, thereby enabling\nthem to acquire domain-specific vocabulary (Chen et al.\n2024). However, terminology evolves rapidly as new terms\n*Work done during internship at ByteDance.\n\u2020Corresponding author.\nAudio\nEncoder\nPrompt\nCross-attn\nRetriever\nTop-k Term Words\nText\nTokenizer\nS\nSpeech Large Language\u00a0Model\nFigure 1: The overall architecture of Attention2Probability.\nAudio features are extracted and then fed into a cross-\nattention retriever, which retrieves the Top-k terms with the\nhighest probability of occurrence within the audio. These\nretrieved terms are concatenated with the prompt. Finally,\nthe prompt and the audio features are jointly input into the\nspeech large language model.\nemerge and old ones become obsolete daily (Coupland\n2014; Morgan 2025). Fine-tuning is time-consuming, and\ndata collection is difficult, making this approach poorly\nsuited for dynamic terminology intervention.\nWith SLMs\u2019 in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, new\nmethods avoid fine-tuning by incorporating potential terms\ninto prompts to enhance terminology generation accuracy\n(Lakomkin et al. 2024; Gong et al. 2024). ICL demon-\nstrates notable efficacy in terminology intervention but ex-\nhibits high prompt sensitivity: accurate candidate terms can\nserve as references for SLMs, thereby enhancing the accu-\nracy of terminology generation. Consequently, the core chal-\nlenge lies in retrieving relevant terms.\nTo address the retrieval challenge in speech scenarios,\nrecent works such as Seal (Sun et al. 2025) adopt Vector\nDataBase (VectorDB) for terminology retrieval, inheriting\nthe RAG framework (Lewis et al. 2020; Gao et al. 2023).\nHowever, unlike text-centric RAG methods, these solutions\nmust incorporate speech-text modal alignment strategies.\nThis adaptation is critical because the inherent modality gap\nbetween speech and text precludes direct application of con-\narXiv:2508.18701v1  [cs.CL]  26 Aug 2025\n\nventional VectorDB techniques (Gong et al. 2025).\nHowever, VectorDB methods face significant issues:\n\u2022 High Training Cost: Training modality alignment mod-\nels for speech and text requires large-scale datasets and\nentails extended training durations.\n\u2022 Poor Retrieval Accuracy: VectorDB performs retrieval\nbased on cosine similarity, but it\u2019s not equivalent to the\nprobability of terms appearing in audio, resulting in sub-\noptimal recall rates.\nTo address these limitations, we propose the Atten-\ntion2Probability (A2P) method. As shown in Figure 1,\nA2P completely eliminates the VectorDB used in prior ap-\nproaches, replacing it with a cross-attention mechanism.\nThis mechanism computes attention weights between the\nspeech input and candidate terms, converting these weights\ndirectly into the probability of each term\u2019s presence in the\nspeech.\nBased on these probabilities, the Top-k most probable\nterms are selected to identify the terms most likely present\nin the speech. These terms are appended to the prompt,\nexplicitly informing the SLM of likely relevant terms to\nguide accurate generation of the target-language terminol-\nogy. Crucially, without requiring any dedicated modal align-\nment training, A2P achieves high terminology recall accu-\nracy. The main contributions of this paper are summarized\nas follows:\n\u2022 We depart from conventional VectorDB approaches by\nintroducing a cross-attention mechanism for terminology\nretrieval, providing a new paradigm for future research in\nthis domain.\n\u2022 We have constructed a dedicated speech recognition\nand translation terminological dataset by leveraging\nMegaTTS (Jiang et al. 2025) and open-source terminol-\nogy translation data, and will publicly release it.\n\u2022 Our proposed A2P framework achieves high terminology\nrecall accuracy.\n\u2022 We critically examine limitations in current methods,\nlaying a foundation for further exploration in this area.\nRelated work\nTextual Terminology Translation\nFor traditional machine translation tasks, achieving termi-\nnology translation typically involves two approaches: con-\nstrained generation and data augmentation. Constrained\ngeneration methods enforce the model to generate target ter-\nminology during the inference stage through a series of con-\nstraint mechanisms (Hokamp and Liu 2017; Post and Vilar\n2018; Hasler et al. 2018). For instance, during beam search,\nscore rewards are assigned to translation candidates contain-\ning terminology to boost the ranking of terminology-related\ncandidates.\nThe data augmentation schemes are further divided into\ntwo types: Placeholder and Code-Switch. The Placeholder\nmethod replaces terms in the source text with special tokens,\nand then replaces these special tokens with target terms after\ntranslation (Dinu et al. 2019; Bergmanis and Pinnis 2021).\nCode-Switch method doesn\u2019t use special tokens; instead, it\ndirectly replaces source-language terms with target terms\n(Crego et al. 2016; Michon, Crego, and Senellart 2020).\nThese methods can effectively improve the terminol-\nogy generation accuracy in textual terminology translation.\nHowever, they are not applicable to speech: constrained gen-\neration methods are time-consuming (Beurer-Kellner, Fis-\ncher, and Vechev 2024), while data augmentation methods\nare difficult to implement due to modal differences.\nSpeech Tasks with Terminology Intervention\nA common paradigm for speech tasks with terminology in-\ntervention involves three steps: first training for modal align-\nment, then retrieving terms via VectorDB, and finally adding\nthe terms to prompts to intervene in SLM generation (Yang\net al. 2024; Feng et al. 2025). The differences lie in the\nmethods for modal alignment. For instance, Seal adopts con-\ntrastive learning (Sun et al. 2025), while BR-ASR (Gong\net al. 2025) uses CLAP (Elizalde et al. 2023). A few works\ndon\u2019t follow this paradigm; Locate-and-Focus retrieves au-\ndio frames containing terms via semantic similarity, then\nperforms replacement using Code-Switch-like techniques\nand additionally adds special tokens (Wu et al. 2025).\nThese methods share the commonality of retrieving terms\nbased on semantic similarity, which is simple and feasible.\nHowever, due to the rigor of terminology, we require every\ncharacter to be completely accurate. Yet, semantic similar-\nity methods tend to recall words semantically similar to the\nreal terms, which is not the result we expect. Furthermore,\nall the aforementioned works are tested on general-domain\ndatasets, which differ significantly from real-world termi-\nnology scenarios. Therefore, our proposed A2P method di-\nrectly calculates the probability of term occurrence instead\nof relying on semantic similarity, and avoids scenario differ-\nences by training on terminology data.\nMethod\nIn this section, we commence with the formal problem for-\nmulation, followed by an introduction to the multi-modal\nfeature extraction scheme. Subsequently, we detail the prin-\nciples of the proposed A2P and its associated training loss\nfunction. We then elaborate on the curriculum learning strat-\negy implemented during training. Finally, we delineate the\noperational workflow of the Retriever during inference. The\noverall architecture of the Retriever is shown in Fig. 2.\nProblem Formulation\nIn terminology retriever tasks, we define the training\ndata as Dtrain = {speech, src terms}, where src terms\nrefers to the terminology in the same language as the\nspeech. During inference, the data is defined as Dinfer =\n{speech, term bank}, where the term bank contains both\nsrc terms and their corresponding tgt terms. Our pro-\nposed A2P framework consists of four key stages: Multi-\nmodal Feature Extraction, Cross-Modal Retriever Training,\nCurriculum learning, and Terminology-Augmented Infer-\nence. Each stage will be introduced sequentially in the fol-\nlowing sections.\n\nTerm Word Feature\nSpeech Feature\nCross-Attn\nToken-Level Pooling\nLinear & Sigmoid\nFigure 2: The overall architecture of the Retriever in the A2P\nmethod.\nMulti-modal Feature Extraction\nThere exists a modality gap between raw speech signals and\ntextual data. To address this gap, we seek to align speech and\ntext features within a shared latent space. The multimodal\nmodel Qwen2-Audio-Instruction exhibits the capacity for\njoint comprehension of both speech and textual modalities,\nindicating that its feature space inherently encodes repre-\nsentations of both. Accordingly, we utilize the audio en-\ncoder from Qwen2-Audio-Instruction to extract speech fea-\ntures, while textual inputs are directly processed via standard\nembedding layers. Our framework processes each modality\nthrough dedicated pathways:\nhs = f audio\n\u03b8\n(speech) \u2208Rd\n(1)\nht = gtext\n\u03d5 (src term) \u2208Rd\n(2)\nwhere f audio\n\u03b8\nand gtext\n\u03d5\nrepresents the parameter of Qwen2-\nAudio-Instruction\u2019s audio-encoder and embedding mod-\nule. d-dimensional is the embedding dimension of Qwen2-\nAudio-Instruction. f audio\n\u03b8\nand gtext\n\u03d5\nare kept frozen during\ntraining.\nCross-Modal Retriever Training\nInspired by advancements in the field of speech tasks with\nterminology intervention, we propose a speech retriever ar-\nchitecture. Using a cross-attention mechanism, our model\ncomputes the attention weights between speech signals and\ndifferent candidate terms. These attention weights directly\nindicate the probability of each term\u2019s presence in the\nspeech. The specific formula is as follows:\nSattn = MHA(hs, ht)\n(3)\nwhere MHA is the multi-head cross attention, hs and ht are\nthe feature of speech and terms.\nWhile we have obtained attention weights between terms\nand speech signals, these weights remain inherently token-\nlevel due to the initial term processing through a tokenizer.\nHowever, our optimization objective requires computing the\nSARS\nCOV\n2\nspeech\nspeech\nSARS-COV-2\nFigure 3: Schematic of token-level pooling. For example, a\nmulti-word term like \u201dSARS-COV-2\u201d is tokenized by the to-\nkenizer into subword units. Token-level pooling aggregates\nthese subword representations, thus preserving the term\u2019s se-\nmantic integrity and allowing the retriever to focus on the\nholistic information of the term.\nprobability of term occurrence in the speech, which necessi-\ntates aggregating term-level information beyond token-level\nrepresentations.\nTo address this, we propose an effective pooling method:\nsum the token-level weights to obtain the overall attention\nweight of the speech towards terms. To ensure the stability\nof subsequent training, we normalize the attention weight\nbased on the lengths of the speech and term, as illustrated in\nFigure 3. The specific formula is as follows:\nSmasked = Sattn \u2299Mspeech \u2299Mtext\n(4)\nSsum =\nL\nX\ni=1\nSmasked[i]\n(5)\nMsum =\nL\nX\ni=1\nMtext\n(6)\nSpooled =\nSsum\nMsum + \u03f5\n(7)\nwhere Mspeech and Mtext respectively represent the mask\nmatrices of speech features and text features, and \u03f5 is a min-\nimal number used to avoid the situation where the denomi-\nnator is zero.\nFirst, we extract the relevant signals using mask matrices\nto eliminate irrelevant positions in Eq. 4. Subsequently, sum-\nmation along the term-length dimension utilizes the actual\nterm length to prevent gradient instability caused by high-\ndimensional interactions, where division by the term length\nserves as dimensional reduction regularization. This design\nexplicitly converts fine-grained token correlations into ro-\nbust term-level representations while maintaining numerical\nstability throughout the training process. In the end, we im-\nplement a residual connection (He et al. 2016) to preserve\noriginal semantic information.\nSfinal = ht + Spooled\n(8)\n\u02c6y = \u03c3(Linear(Sfinal))\n(9)\nTo address data scarcity in speech-to-text tasks with ter-\nminology intervention, we calculate the loss of positive and\n\nnegative samples simultaneously. This helps the model learn\nto recognize terms present in the speech while distinguishing\nabsent terms, thereby improving retrieval robustness. The\nformalized loss function combines dual objectives:\nL = E(s, t+)[\u2212log \u02c6y+]\n|\n{z\n}\nPositive term maximization\n+ E(s, t\u2212)[\u2212log(1 \u2212\u02c6y\u2212)]\n|\n{z\n}\nNegative term minimization\n(10)\nWhere \u02c6y+/t+ denote positive samples (term present in\nspeech) and \u02c6y\u2212/t\u2212represent negative samples (term absent).\nCurriculum Learning\nDue to the highly heterogeneous length distribution of real-\nworld terms, a retriever without well-initialized parameters\nstruggles to effectively learn both short and long terms si-\nmultaneously. To tackle this training challenge, we adopt\na curriculum learning strategy (Bengio et al. 2009; Wang,\nChen, and Zhu 2021), by organizing the training process into\nthree successive stages:\n\u2022 Word-level: In this stage, terms within the training data\nconsist of randomly selected individual words from the\ntext. The fine-grained nature and uniform length of these\nterms significantly reduce the learning difficulty of A2P,\nfacilitating initial parameter estimation.\n\u2022 Phrase-Level: Building upon the acquired ability to de-\ntect fine-grained terms, this stage utilizes randomly se-\nlected sequences of 1 to 4 consecutive words within the\ntext as terms. The objective is to progressively enhance\nthe A2P sensitivity in terms of varying lengths.\n\u2022 Real-Term Level: Following the preceding stages, the\nretriever possesses well-initialized parameters. Conse-\nquently, this final stage employs authentic terms for train-\ning, ensuring robust recall capability under real-world\nconditions.\nTerminology-Augmented Inference\nDuring deployment, the trained retriever performs efficient\ncross-modal matching between input speech and a prede-\nfined terminology bank term bank = tm\ni=1 containing m\nterms. The retrieval process is formalized as:\np(ti|speech) = \u03c3(\u03c8\u03b8(speech, ti)),\n\u2200i \u2208[0, m]\n(11)\nK = argtopk\n1\u2264i\u2264m\n(p(ti|speech))\n(12)\nTretrieved = term bank[k],\n\u2200k \u2208K\n(13)\nwhere \u03c8\u03b8 represents the retriever parameters, Eq. 11 is used\nto compute the presence probability of terms from the termi-\nnology base within the speech, utilizing the Retriever. These\nterms are then ranked by descending probability, and the in-\ndices of the Top-K terms are retrieved. These indices query\nthe terminology base to obtain the candidate term set.\nUpon retrieving candidate terms Tretrieved, we spell them\ninto the prompt and inject this knowledge by leveraging the\nICL capabilities of LLM.\nName\nHours\nSents\nLanguage\nComMT\n7.5\n3.3K\nEN, ZH\nNiutrans\n36\n18.5K\nEN, ZH\nLibrispeech\n960\n286.8K\nEN\nFew-nerd\n177\n58.5K\nEN\nWikiann\n13\n11.5K\nEN\nKaggle-NER\n106\n40.9K\nEN\nAishell-2\n1000\n560.5K\nZH\nMSRA-NER\n80\n27.5K\nZH\nNLPC2018\n12\n13.1K\nZH\nCMeEE\n60\n20K\nZH\nTable 1: Statistics of all datasets.\nPrompt Example: This is an English audio recording.\nPlease transcribe this audio into English text. Specialized\nterminology may appear in the audio. Please accurately\nrecognize these terms. Potential technical terms include:\nSARS, RSA, SARS-CoV, Boris, SARS-CoV-2, respira-\ntory, respirator, Tapia, war, and respiratory disease.\nExperiments\nDataset\nTo date, there are no open-source datasets for speech-to-text\ntasks with terminology intervention. Even datasets for tex-\ntual terminology translation are extremely scarce. Therefore,\nwe devise an alternative strategy:\nWe repurpose entities from Named Entity Recognition\n(NER) datasets as terms, and then utilize MegaTTS to gen-\nerate corresponding speech for their textual definitions. As\nshown in Table 1, we collect data from both Chinese and\nEnglish, and also evaluate the performance of these two lan-\nguage directions in subsequent tasks. Such as Wikiann (Pan\net al. 2017), MSRA-NER (Levow 2006), Few-nerd (Ding\net al. 2021) and CMeEE (Du, Jia, and Zan 2022).\nGiven the limited data volume achievable via the first\nstrategy, we further augment our data by leveraging the Lib-\nriSpeech (Panayotov et al. 2015) and Aishell-2 (Du et al.\n2018) datasets, designating certain words or phrases within\ntheir utterances as terms. This approach enables the cost-\neffective acquisition of large-scale data.\nTo evaluate model performance, we utilize the Chinese-\nEnglish terminology translation test set from the ma-\nchine translation dataset ComMT (Luo et al. 2025). This\nhigh-confidence dataset comprises carefully curated terms\nsourced from authoritative benchmarks, including WMT\nand DAS, with domain coverage concentrated in news and\nmedicine. Consistent with the prior experimental configura-\ntion, we also synthesize bidirectional speech corpora using\nMegaTTS.\nExperimental setups\nPre-processing\nFor speech data, LibriSpeech has a sam-\npling rate of 16 kHz, while other TTS-generated speech\n\ndata use a sampling rate of 24 kHz. During speech loading,\nall data is uniformly resampled to 16 kHz. For terminology\ndata, the word-level terms in LibriSpeech are sourced from\nthe all rare subset in Rare5k (Le et al. 2021), while phrase-\nlevel terms are constructed by randomly selecting text spans\nfrom utterances. For Aishell-2, words or phrases are ran-\ndomly selected to facilitate both word-level and phrase-level\ntraining. Terms in TTS-generated data correspond to entity\nnames from the original NER datasets. All data undergoes\nfeature extraction strictly following the default configuration\nof Qwen2-Audio-Instruction, with the original vocabulary\nretained without modification.\nModel Setting\nWe employ the Qwen2-Audio-Instruction\nmodel as our SLM. The instruction-tuned variant is selected\nbecause terms are dynamically incorporated into the prompt,\nnecessitating robust instruction-following capabilities, par-\nticularly in handling dynamically constructed prompts. For\nthe audio encoder, we utilize the pretrained weights from\nQwen2-Audio-Instruction. To ensure compatibility with the\nencoder, the hidden dimension of the cross-attention re-\ntriever is accordingly set to 4096. The Retriever employs\nonly a single-layer cross-attention mechanism, with the\nmulti-head attention configured with 32 heads and a dropout\nrate of 0.1.\nRetriever Training and Inference\nDuring training, the\nbatch size is set to 32, with a maximum term bank capac-\nity of 100 terms per batch. We train with a maximum of 50\nepochs and a learning rate of 1e-4. The initial learning rate\nis 1e-7, accompanied by 500 warmup steps. The CosineAn-\nnealingLR scheduler is adopted for learning rate decay. Op-\ntimization used AdamW with hyperparameters \u03b21=0.9, \u03b22=\n0.98, and weight decay = 0.01.\nDuring inference, the Retriever operates on a terminology\nbank comprising all 583 terms from the test set. All models\nare trained on 8 Nvidia Tesla A100-80G GPUs. We imple-\nment our models based on the Accelerator.\nInstruction Fine-Tuning\nWhen intervening in ASR and\nST tasks with terminology, robust instruction-following\ncapabilities become essential for the SLM due to the\nadded terminology. To ensure effective terminology utiliza-\ntion, we perform instruction fine-tuning on Qwen2-Audio-\nInstruction.\nThe Niutrans1 dataset from Table 1, containing parallel\nEnglish-Chinese corpora, is used for fine-tuning. To enhance\nthe SLM\u2019s instruction adherence, ASR and ST tasks are ran-\ndomly interleaved during training. Furthermore, terminol-\nogy presentation is randomly assigned to four conditions: no\nterminology, entirely correct terminology, entirely incorrect\nterminology, and partially correct terminology.\nWe use the LlamaFactory toolkit for training, with 3\nepochs and a learning rate of 2e-6 (Zheng et al. 2024). We\nemploy full fine-tuning within the DeepSpeed framework\n(Rajbhandari et al. 2020), setting the stage parameter to 3.\nBaseline Systems\nTo validate the effectiveness of our ap-\nproach, we conduct comparative experiments against a con-\n1challenge.xfyun.cn/topic/info?type=machine-translation-2024\nventional VectorDB solution. The Chroma VectorDB is em-\nployed, utilizing cosine similarity for distance computation,\nwith the SONAR modality alignment model selected as the\nSOTA open-source baseline. We adopt the HNSW algorithm\nfor indexing, while other parameters are configured using\nChroma\u2019s default settings.\nTo further investigate the impact of the audio en-\ncoder on Retriever performance, we evaluate three alterna-\ntive encoders: Qwen-Audio-Chat and SONAR. Notably, as\nSONAR inherently outputs dense embeddings, pooling op-\nerations are omitted for the specific encoder.\nResults and Analysis\nIn this section, we will first present the recall rate of Re-\ntriever under different Settings and analyze the performance\ndifferences between A2P and VectorDB. Next, we will ana-\nlyze the impact of curriculum learning on the Retriever. Af-\nter that, we analyze what effects different Audio-Encoders\nhave on the Retriever and analyze the reasons. Then, we\nwill analyze the changes in recall performance and recall\nspeed under different sizes of terminology databases. Last\nbut not least, the changes in LLM performance before and\nafter using recall terms to intervene in speech recognition\nand speech translation will be demonstrated.\nMain Results of the A2P Method\nTable 2 presents the recall rates of various approaches un-\nder multiple conditions. It is observable that the A2P ap-\nproach achieves high terminology recall accuracy with spe-\ncific audio encoders, surpassing the VectorDB method by a\nsubstantial margin. A2P exhibits an absolute performance\nadvantage, particularly when retrieving fewer terms.\nWe conduct an analysis to understand this phenomenon,\nrevealing an intriguing insight: the VectorDB method funda-\nmentally doesn\u2019t perform retrieval; instead, it identifies se-\nmantically similar vectors within the embedding space.\nCore Limitation of VectorDB Approach\nThe VectorDB\nfinds the term vectors closest to the speech vector using co-\nsine similarity. The similarity between terms and speech in\nthe semantic space does not equal the probability of the\nterm occurrence in the speech. This occurs because com-\npressing the audio into a single vector makes the seman-\ntic information highly concentrated. As a result, during re-\ntrieval, the VectorDB often recalls terms that are semanti-\ncally relevant but not present in the original audio.\nAdvantages of of A2P\nThe A2P method is explicitly op-\ntimized to detect terms that are present within the speech\nsignal. This optimization objective results in retrieved terms\nhaving a significantly higher probability of actual occur-\nrence in the speech.\nThe Impact of Audio-Encoder\nFurther Analysis from Table 2: A pronounced performance\ndiscrepancy is observed across different audio encoders.\nWhen employing SONAR as the audio encoder, the A2P\ndemonstrates suboptimal performance on the English test set\nand fails to yield measurable results on the Chinese test set.\n\nLanguage\nRetriever type\nAudio-encoder\nTop-10\nTop-20\nTop-30\nTop-40\nTop-50\nEN\nVectorDB\nSONAR\n62.89\n73.74\n77.98\n81.11\n83.49\nA2P\nSONAR\n15.15\n26.57\n30.38\n31.58\n33.93\nA2P\nQwen-Audio-Chat\n7.04\n13.15\n17.64\n21.71\n25.27\nA2P (Ours)\nQwen2-Audio-Instruction\n75.55\n81.57\n83.82\n85.72\n86.83\nZH\nVectorDB\nSONAR\n58.46\n67.22\n72.51\n78.19\n81.51\nA2P\nSONAR\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nA2P\nQwen-Audio-Chat\n60.32\n69.74\n73.69\n76.15\n78.01\nA2P (Ours)\nQwen2-Audio-Instruction\n83.31\n89.44\n91.03\n92.29\n92.57\nTable 2: The recall of Retriever under different Settings. - means less than 1%\n583\n1k\n5k\n10k\nA2P\n8.71ms\n13.44ms\n62.86ms\n126.31ms\nVectorDB\n0.74ms\n0.85ms\n1.17ms\n0.91ms\nTable 3: Recall speed under different terminology databases.\nWe attribute this limitation to SONAR extraction of ultra-\nhigh-dimensional features, which exceeds the modeling ca-\npacity of our lightweight A2P architecture (80M parame-\nters). Scaling the Retriever to parameter magnitudes com-\nparable to SeamlessM4T (e.g., billion-scale) might enable\neffective utilization of SONAR feature representations.\nQwen-Audio-Chat exhibits disparate performance: it ap-\nproaches VectorDB performance on Chinese but underper-\nforms on English. We hypothesize this stems primarily from\nimbalances in its training data, likely reflecting greater Chi-\nnese data abundance during training. These findings ad-\ndress the question posed in the Introduction. Firstly, modal-\nity alignment proves critical for cross-modal retrieval, di-\nrectly impacting performance. Secondly, some SLMs in-\nherently possess this alignment capability without requiring\ndedicated training. The existing Qwen2-Audio-Instruction\nmodel already demonstrates strong inherent alignment.\nDifferent Sizes of Terminology Databases\nSpeed\nTable 3 presents the average retrieval time per\nquery for both methods. The VectorDB solution consistently\noutperforms the A2P approach across all tested terminology\ndatabase scales. Further analysis of A2P\u2019s latency reveals\nthat approximately 60% of the processing time is consumed\nby the Top-k selection algorithm. Top-k operation, with its\nO(N log K) time complexity, represents the primary com-\nputational bottleneck in the A2P pipeline.\nFurthermore, it can be clearly observed from Table 3 that\nthe latency of A2P increases with the expansion of the vo-\ncabulary size, which is attributed to the increased compu-\ntational load. By contrast, the retrieval speed of VectorDB\nremains consistently stable. Moreover, we argue that the re-\ntrieval speed can be further enhanced by adopting more ef-\nficient indexing methods (e.g., GPU-optimized indexes), a\nperformance that A2P cannot match.\n1\n2\n3\n4\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nRecall / %\nA2P-ZH\nA2P-EN\nVectorDB-ZH\nVectorDB-EN\nFigure 4: The trend of the recall rate when k=50 as the ter-\nminology database size increases is shown below. Here, 1\ndenotes 583 terms, while 2, 3, and 4 denote 1k, 5k, and 10k\nterms, respectively.\nRecall\nWithin the same language, A2P consistently out-\nperforms the VectorDB approach across all metrics, as\nshown in Fig. 4. Furthermore, while A2P maintains robust\nperformance on Chinese, it exhibits a more pronounced de-\ncline on English. We attribute this divergence to fundamen-\ntal differences in language typology.\nThe typological distinction between Chinese (an isolating\nlanguage) and English (a fusional language) leads to dras-\ntically different semantic representations (Wiltschko 2008).\nThis manifests in terminology retrieval: terms phonetically\nsimilar to English roots or affixes are highly susceptible to\nfalse recalls.

Our generated audio corpus (\u223c100k samples)\nlikely falls below the scaling law threshold required for op-\ntimal Retriever performance. Consequently, a Curriculum\nLearning training pipeline may become unnecessary when\nsufficient authentic data is available.\nFurthermore, ablating the token-level pooling drastically\nreduced the overall recall of A2P to below 1%. We attribute\nthis to inherent redundancy in token-level attention weights.\nThe simple linear structure struggles to capture the holistic\nsemantics of terms from this complex information. The re-\nsult strongly validates the design rationale behind the A2P\narchitecture.\nThe Influence of A2P on ASR and ST\nTable 5 presents the performance changes for ASR and ST\ntasks after terminology intervention using Qwen2-Audio-\nInstruction. The A/B metric represents text quality versus\nterminology generation accuracy. For ASR, Character Error\nRate (CER) is used for Chinese evaluation, and WER for\nEnglish. For ST, BLEU scores are used for both languages.\nTerminology generation accuracy showed significant im-\nprovement across both tasks. For ASR, accuracy increased\nby approximately 6% on average in English and 5% in Chi-\nnese. The improvement is more pronounced in ST tasks,\nwith English-to-Chinese translation gaining about 12% and\nChinese-to-English improving by 13%.\nWhile the intervention approach achieves strong perfor-\nmance in ASR, limitations remain in ST. Notably, interven-\ntion improves both BLEU scores and terminology accuracy\nin ST, yet the terminology accuracy remains unsatisfactory.\nThe complexity of ST for SLM contributes to the terminol-\nogy accuracy being significantly lower than the recall rates\nin ST. This indicates that many correctly retrieved terms are\nnot effectively utilized by the SLM. However, these results\nalso demonstrate the challenging nature of our proposed\ndataset for current SLMs.\nFurthermore, SLM performance doesn\u2019t strictly improve\nwith increasing terminology volume. For example, increas-\ning terms from 30 to 40 degraded performance in English\nASR but improved it in Chinese ASR. We attribute this phe-\nnomenon primarily to limitations in the SLM\u2019s ICL capa-\nbilities. Insufficient ICL capabilities of SLM likely hinder\nmaintaining ASR/ST performance when processing numer-\nous terms.\nThese findings reveal new challenges for speech-to-text\ntasks with terminology intervention.\n(1) How can terminology accuracy in ST tasks be effec-\ntively increased?\n(2) How can SLMs preserve baseline ASR/ST perfor-\nmance when handling multiple terms?\nConclusion\nThis paper first addresses the data scarcity issue in\nterminology-augmented ASR and ST tasks by generating\na labeled dataset using open-source MT, NER data, and\nMegaTTS. The public release of this dataset is expected\nto significantly advance research in this domain. Subse-\nquently, to mitigate terminology retrieval accuracy limita-\ntions, we propose the A2P methodology, which effectively\ncircumvents two critical constraints inherent in VectorDB\n\napproaches while achieving superior recall rates in exper-\nimental evaluations. Notwithstanding these advancements,\nA2P currently exhibits high latency compared to VectorDB\nin retrieval throughput. Crucially, we demonstrate that sys-\ntematic incorporation of retrieved terminology into SLM\narchitectures significantly enhances terminology generation\naccuracy across both ASR and ST tasks. Additionally, our\nanalysis reveals two critical issues in existing SLMs, offer-\ning valuable insights for future research in this field.\nReferences\nBengio, Y.; Louradour, J.; Collobert, R.; and Weston, J.\n2009.

Robust Medical Visual\nQuestion Answering via Joint Consistency and\nContrastive Learning\nSongtao Jiang1,5, Yuxi Chen1, Sibo Song2, Yan Zhang1, Yeying Jin3, Yang\nFeng4, Jian Wu1,6, and Zuozhu Liu1,6(B)\n1 Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China\n2 Alibaba Group, Zhejiang, China\n3 National University of Sinapore, Sinapore\n4 Angelalign Technology Inc., Shanghai, China\n5 ChohoTech Inc., Hangzhou, China\n6 Zhejiang Key Laboratory of Medical Imaging Artificial Intelligence, Zhejiang, China\nAbstract. In high-stakes medical applications, consistent answering across\ndiverse question phrasings is essential for reliable diagnosis. However, we\nreveal that current Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) ex-\nhibit concerning fragility in Medical Visual Question Answering, as their\nanswers fluctuate significantly when faced with semantically equivalent\nrephrasings of medical questions. We attribute this to two limitations:\n(1) insufficient alignment of medical concepts, leading to divergent rea-\nsoning patterns, and (2) hidden biases in training data that prioritize\nsyntactic shortcuts over semantic understanding. To address these chal-\nlenges, we construct RoMed, a dataset built upon original VQA datasets\ncontaining 144k questions with variations spanning word-level, sentence-\nlevel, and semantic-level perturbations. When evaluating state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) models like LLaVA-Med on RoMed, we observe alarming perfor-\nmance drops (e.g., a 40% decline in Recall) compared to original VQA\nbenchmarks, exposing critical robustness gaps. To bridge this gap, we\npropose Consistency and Contrastive Learning (CCL), which integrates\ntwo key components: (1) knowledge-anchored consistency learning, align-\ning Med-VLMs with medical knowledge rather than shallow feature pat-\nterns, and (2) bias-aware contrastive learning, mitigating data-specific\npriors through discriminative representation refinement. CCL achieves\nSOTA performance on three popular VQA benchmarks and notably im-\nproves answer consistency by 50% on the challenging RoMed test set,\ndemonstrating significantly enhanced robustness.

A simple perturbation experiment demonstrates that current Med-VLMs ex-\nhibit inconsistencies in VQA tasks, raising concerns about the robustness of Med-VQA.\nremarkable progress in Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) [14, 13,\n11, 10, 22]. Through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on Med-VQA training sets,\nthese models achieve strong performance on downstream tasks. However, as\nillustrated in Fig. 1, our preliminary tests reveal a critical limitation: When\nquestions are perturbed with varying levels of modifications while preserving\nsemantic equivalence, models often produce inconsistent answers. This inconsis-\ntency severely restricts their applicability in real-world clinical settings, where\ndiverse and interactive query formulations are common. Moreover, it raises fun-\ndamental concerns about current Med-VQA evaluation framework: Is the model\ntruly knowing the answers, or is it merely memorizing response patterns and\nguessing correctly by chance?\nTo investigate further, we augmented the diversity of the original training\ndata by introducing word-level perturbations. As shown in Fig. 1, vanilla SFT\nwith more varied training data provides only marginal improvements in robust-\nness against perturbations, with performance still significantly deviating from\nthe original evaluation results. This yields two key insights: (1) the lack of diver-\nsity in training data contributes to the inconsistency issue [?,12], and increasing\ndiversity can mildly mitigate it [25]; and (2) the current SFT paradigm, with its\nsingle autoregressive objective, has inherent limitations, as increasing data diver-\nsity alone provides minimal robustness gains. These findings highlight the need\nfor a more robust Med-VQA evaluation framework and training methodology.\nTo address these challenges, we first construct the RoMed dataset as shown\nin Fig. 2, a new Med-VQA dataset encompassing training and testing sets across\nfour major medical modalities: CT, MRI, X-Ray, and Pathology. For the training\nset, we enhance diversity by introducing multi-level perturbations at the word,\nsentence, and semantic levels, enriching the original Med-VQA training data.\nFor the test set, we reconstruct a more comprehensive VQA benchmark based\non mainstream Med-VQA datasets. Unlike traditional datasets [32, 30] that fo-\ncus solely on accuracy, we incorporate evaluation metrics such as the Coefficient\nof Variation (CV) and Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) to assess answer con-\nsistency, providing a more robust evaluation framework.\nFurthermore, we propose Joint Consistency and Contrastive Learning (CCL)\nto address the limitations of the current SFT paradigm.

Overview of our CCL pipeline. Our framework consists of two key compo-\nnents: (a) constructing the RoMed dataset through medical multi-agent collaboration;\n(b) joint knowledge-anchored consistency learning for medical expertise alignment and\nbias-aware contrastive learning to reduce inherent representation biases.\nlearning [6], CCL provides explicit supervision signals to ensure the model de-\nlivers correct answers across various perturbations, fostering better alignment\nwith medical knowledge rather than shallow, overfitting features. Additionally,\nby treating perturbed questions as positive samples and using other questions\nin the same batch as negative samples, CCL guides the model to perform com-\nparative understanding by leveraging contrastive learning objective [15]. This\ndual-objective approach mitigates potential overfitting in the model\u2019s repre-\nsentations and significantly enhances its generalization capabilities, making it\nmore robust and reliable for real-world clinical applications. Extensive experi-\nments and analyses demonstrate that CCL not only significantly enhances Med-\nVQA performance but also markedly reduces MAD and CV, thereby improving\nmodel robustness. CCL achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) accuracy and robust-\nness on widely-used benchmarks, including Rad-VQA [16], SLAKE [19], and\nPathVQA [8].\n\n\u2018 \u2014lHead: 26.1% : me ark\n' mM) [Necks 16%) $\ni 1\n'\n\\ As Chest! 167%] | waren\n% : !\nH tung e222 5 woe 6K\n' a '\nH \u2018Abdomen: 34.2%) |\n' t\nu !

RoMed Datasets Construction\n\n\n4\nSongtao Jiang et al.\n2\nMethods\nIn this section, we first describe the construction of the RoMed dataset, address-\ning the lack of robustness evaluation in current Med-VQA systems. To tackle\nthe limited generalization of vanilla SFT, we introduce our Joint Consistency\nand Contrastive Learning (CCL) framework, which optimizes Med-VLM repre-\nsentation learning by integrating consistency and contrastive objectives.\n2.1\nRoMed Datasets Construction\nOur study reveals that current Med-VQA systems often fail to answer seman-\ntically equivalent perturbed questions correctly (see Fig. 1), despite accurately\nanswering the original questions. This suggests that the reported accuracy on\nexisting Med-VQA benchmarks may not reliably reflect the true knowledge\nlevel of Med-VLMs. To address this limitation, we construct a more diverse\nand robust evaluation dataset for Med-VQA (see Fig. 3 a). First, we inte-\ngrate widely used Med-VQA datasets, including Rad-VQA [16], SLAKE [19],\nand PathVQA [8], which cover various organs and modalities. Building on these\ndatasets, we introduce perturbations at three levels: word-level, sentence-level,\nand semantic-level, using a medical multi-agent collaboration system. Specifi-\ncally, we leverage three models to generate high-quality perturbations, combining\nboth general-purpose and domain-specific VLMs. For the medical multimodal\nagent, we employ HuatuoGPT-Vision-34B [5], a leading medical VLM, which\nprovides domain-specific medical knowledge by generating captions for the given\nmedical images. For the medical reasoning agent, we use HuatuoGPT-o1 [4], a\nsingle-modal LLM with advanced reasoning capabilities. This agent takes the\ncaptions and question-answer pairs as input to produce intermediate reasoning\nsteps for sampling correct reasoning processes. Finally, we utilize GPT-4o as the\ngeneral meta-agent, a state-of-the-art closed-source model, to integrate feedback\nfrom both the medical multimodal and reasoning agents, generating three lev-\nels of perturbed questions along with their corresponding answers. After this\nprocess, we validate the constructed questions by feeding them back to GPT-\n4o, ensuring they align with the same medical knowledge as the original ques-\ntions and do not require additional knowledge beyond what is needed to answer\nthe original questions correctly. Following this validation step, we construct the\nRoMed dataset, as shown in Fig. 2. Since perturbed questions are derived from\nthe original ones, an ideal robust VLM should consistently answer all variants\ncorrectly within each question cluster. To quantify consistency, we introduce two\nmetrics: Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD), defined as MAD = 1\nN\nPN\ni=1 |xi \u2212\u00b5|,\nand Coefficient of Variation (CV), defined as CV = \u03c3\n\u00b5 \u00d7 100%, where N is the\nnumber of questions in a cluster, xi is the model\u2019s answer to the i-th question,\n\u00b5 is the mean of the answers, and \u03c3 is the standard deviation.\n2.2\nJoint Consistency and Contrastive Learning\nKnowledge-Anchored Consistency Learning Let q denote the original\nquestion, tokenized into text tokens Tq. The corresponding image I is encoded\n\nTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length\n5\ninto visual tokens VI using a visual encoder (e.g., CLIP-ViT). The multimodal\ninput X is formed by concatenating Tq and VI, i.e., X = [Tq; VI]. The input\nX is fed into the LLM backbone, generating outputs Y. The autoregressive loss\nLoriginal is computed as: Loriginal = \u2212PT\nt=1 log P(yt | y<t, X), where T is the out-\nput sequence length and yt is the token at position t. To enhance the alignment\nwith medical knowledge, we perform consistency learning by introducing per-\nturbations at three levels: word-level, sentence-level, and semantic-level. These\nperturbations are constructed through multi-agent collaboration based on the\noriginal question. For each perturbed question qi (i \u2208{w, s, sem}), the perturbed\ninput Xi = [Tqi; VI] is used to compute the total consistency loss:\nLconsistency = Loriginal +\nX\ni\u2208{w,s,sem}\n \n\u2212\nT\nX\nt=1\nlog P(yt | y<t, Xi)\n!\n.\nBias-Aware Contrastive Learning To eliminate bias in the training data\nand calibrate the model\u2019s representation, we employ contrastive learning as\npart of the CCL framework. Specifically, the original question q and its per-\nturbed versions at three levels (qw, qs, and qsem) are treated as positive sam-\nples, while other questions in the same batch serve as negative samples. The\nhidden state embedding H for the original input is obtained by feeding the mul-\ntimodal input X = [Tq; VI] into the LLM backbone and applying mean pooling:\nH = M(LLM(X)), where M(\u00b7) denotes the mean pooling operation. Similarly,\nfor each perturbed question qp (with p \u2208{w, s, sem}), the corresponding hidden\nstate embedding is H+\np = M(LLM([Tqp; VI])). The embeddings of unrelated\nquestions in the batch are denoted as H\u2212\nj . The contrastive loss Lctr is:\nLctr = \u2212\nX\np\u2208{w,s,sem}\nlog\nexp(sim(H, H+\np )/\u03c4)\nexp(sim(H, H+\np )/\u03c4) + PN\nj=1 exp(sim(H, H\u2212\nj )/\u03c4)\n,\nwhere H\u2212\nj represent the embedding of the j-th negative sample, sim(\u00b7, \u00b7) denote\nthe cosine similarity, \u03c4 > 0 be a temperature hyperparameter, and N is the total\nnumber of negative samples. The overall loss is defined as L = Lctr+Lconsistency\n2\n.\n3\nExperiments\nEvaluation Datasets and Metrics. To validate the effectiveness of our pro-\nposed CCL in enhancing traditional VQA performance, we conducted experi-\nments on mainstream Med-VQA datasets, including Rad-VQA [16], SLAKE [19],\nand PathVQA [8]. These datasets cover CT, MRI, Chest-Xray, and Pathology\nmodalities, encompassing both open-ended (free-form answers) and closed-ended\n(yes/no) question settings. For open-ended questions, we used Recall as the eval-\nuation metric, while Accuracy was employed for closed-ended questions, consis-\ntent with prior research. Additionally, to assess the robustness of current Med-\nVLMs, we utilized our constructed RoMed dataset.

For fair comparison, our hyperparameters align with\nLLaVA-Med [17]. We adopt pretrained CLIP-ViT-Large-Patch14 as the vision\nencoder and StableLM [3] and Phi2 [1] as LLM backbones. A 2-layer MLP is\nused as the projector, with training runs for 9 epochs with a learning rate of\n2e-5 without weight decay and a batch size of 2, using 8 \u00d7 RTX 3090 GPUs.\nBaselines. We compare our method with several strong baselines: (1) CLIP-\nbased methods (e.g., PubMedCLIP [7]), which achieve SOTA performance but are\nlimited by their reliance on candidate words for open-ended questions; (2) Medi-\ncal foundation models (e.g., BiomedGPT [30]), which leverage generative multi-\nmodal pretraining but lack multi-turn dialogue capabilities due to their non-LLM\narchitecture; (3) VLM-based models (e.g., LLaVA-Med, LLaVA-v1.5 [17, 21]),\nwhich excel in VQA accuracy and interactive dialogue but prioritize precision\nover robustness. In contrast, our CCL method offers a plug-and-play enhance-\nment for medical models, seamlessly integrating with VLM-based approaches to\nprovide multi-turn dialogue support, improved accuracy, and enhanced robust-\nness, making it ideal for real-world clinical applications.\n\nTitle Suppressed Due to Excessive Length\n7\nA B RoMed-radvqa RoMed-Slake RoMed-Pvqa\nRecall\nAcc\nRecall\nAcc\nRecall\nAcc\nx x\n35.6\n63.9\n60.1\n71.9\n19.2\n64.1\nx \u2713\n44.5\n74.6\n65.1\n74.6\n24.6\n70.0\n\u2713x\n40.7\n65.0\n62.3\n73.5\n20.3\n64.9\n\u2713\u271354.1\n81.4\n70.4\n82.7\n32.7\n82.8\nTable 3.

As shown in Tab. 1, our CCL\nmethod, when integrated with the top-performing LLaVA-Med [17], achieves\nSOTA performance across three benchmarks. Notably, it excels in challenging\nopen-ended questions, demonstrating its effectiveness as a plug-and-play module\nfor robust VQA in clinical settings.\nVQA Robustness Performance Comparison. We evaluated our approach\non the RoMed VQA benchmark, which introduces variations to assess robustness\nunder diverse clinical queries. As shown in Tab. 2, LLaVA-Med\u2019s accuracy drops\nsignificantly (e.g., RAD-VQA [16] recall decreases by nearly 50%). In contrast,\nwith CCL, the model maintains high performance, reducing accuracy loss to\nwithin 20% (Fig. 4). This highlights the limitations of current VQA frameworks\nand underscores CCL\u2019s ability to enhance both performance and robustness for\nreal-world applications.\n3.1\nAblation and Analysis\nAblation of Joint Learning. We conducted experiments to validate the com-\nplementary roles of consistency learning and contrastive learning in our method.\nAs shown in Tab. 3, the absence of either loss leads to a performance degrada-\ntion. Contrastive learning plays a critical role in refining robust representations,\nwhile consistency learning ensures the model acquires knowledge across varied\nquestion formulations and establishes better alignment with medical knowledge.\nThe combination of both components achieves the optimal performance.\nCan SFT Improve VQA Robustness? To verify that our performance im-\nprovements are attributable to CCL rather than additional training data, we\ncompared the performance of LLaVA-Med with CCL and vanilla SFT, both\ntrained on the RoMed trainset. As shown in Fig. 5, vanilla SFT on a larger\ndataset fails to effectively enhance model robustness. This demonstrates the ef-\nfectiveness of CCL, which leverages consistency learning to acquire new knowl-\nedge while utilizing contrastive learning to refine representations.\nRepresentation Visualization Comparison. As shown in Fig. 4 (e) and (f),\nwe observe that in vanilla LLaVA-Med, the embeddings of the three levels of\nvariations and the original questions are widely separated, indicating that the\nrepresentations fail to capture the shared features across different formulations.\nThis sensitivity to perturbations could lead to misdiagnoses in real-world clinical\napplications with diverse query formulations. In contrast, with CCL, the model\u2019s\n\n8\nSongtao Jiang et al.\nFig. 4.

Comparison between SFT and CCL. SFT yields minimal performance gains.\nrepresentations under varied perturbations become more robust, suggesting that\nthe model learns more low-level, generalizable features across different levels of\nperturbations. This makes it better suited for high-stakes clinical scenarios.\nEffect of Scaling Data. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method on larger-\nscale data, we expanded the original VQA questions by generating two additional\nvariations per level (word-level, sentence-level, and semantic-level), resulting in\na dataset twice the size of RoMed training data. This allowed us to explore the\ntrade-off between performance and cost. As shown in Tab. 4, adding one variation\nper level significantly improves the model\u2019s VQA performance and robustness.\nHowever, doubling the dataset size yields only marginal gains. Considering the\ntraining time overhead, expanding by one variation per level enables the model\nto achieve strong generalization capabilities through CCL.\n4\nConclusion\nThis work reveals the fragility of Med-VLMs in providing consistent answers\nto semantically equivalent medical questions, attributing it to insufficient con-\ncept alignment and training data biases.

These rules are derived from extensive\nCyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), which includes attack signatures\nand behavioral patterns obtained through automated tools and\nmanual threat analysis, such as sandboxing. The CTI is then\ntransformed into actionable rules for the IDS engine, enabling\nreal-time detection and prevention. However, the constant evo-\nlution of cyber threats necessitates frequent rule updates, which\ndelay deployment time and weaken overall security readiness.\nRecent advancements in agentic systems powered by Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) offer the potential for autonomous IDS\nrule generation with internal evaluation. We introduce FALCON,\nan autonomous agentic framework that generates deployable\nIDS rules from CTI data in real-time and evaluates them using\nbuilt-in multi-phased validators. To demonstrate versatility, we\ntarget both network (Snort) and host-based (YARA) mediums\nand construct a comprehensive dataset of IDS rules with their\ncorresponding CTIs. Our evaluations indicate FALCON excels in\nautomatic rule generation, with an average of 95% accuracy val-\nidated by qualitative evaluation with 84% inter-rater agreement\namong multiple cybersecurity analysts across all metrics. These\nresults underscore the feasibility and effectiveness of LLM-driven\ndata mining for real-time cyber threat mitigation.\nIndex Terms\u2014Cybersecurity, Intrusion Detection, Rule Gen-\neration, Large Language Models, Agentic AI\nI. INTRODUCTION\nEvery year, approximately 7 trillion intrusion attempts are\nmade globally, with over 90% of breaches exploiting known\nvulnerabilities that are not patched in time [1]. Signature-\nbased Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are engineered to\ncontinuously monitor computer networks and hosts to search\nfor signs of suspicious activity and enable real-time threat\ndetection through a set of predefined rules. These IDS rules\ninclude signatures of malicious attacks along with behavioral\ninformation. Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts are\nresponsible for developing these IDS rules through a structured\nthreat analysis process. This process involves several phases,\nsuch as using automated tools for signature extraction, moni-\ntoring threat behavior in controlled environments (sandboxes),\nand others. All findings during this monitoring phase are\naccumulated as Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) to support rule\ngeneration. The CTI is thoroughly examined to pinpoint ma-\nlicious behaviors and create signatures for effortless detection\nand prevention, ultimately leading to the creation of final and\nactionable IDS rules. This signature-based IDS rule-generation\nprocess is consistent for both networks and hosts.\nDespite their effectiveness, existing IDS rule generation\nprocess faces significant challenges with adapting to today\u2019s\nrapidly evolving cyber threat landscape. Attackers continu-\nously adapt their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs),\nresulting in a rapid increase in both the number of rules that\nmatch new attack signatures and behaviors [2]. Furthermore,\nexisting rules become less effective. Any delay in addressing\npersisting threats can leave systems vulnerable, resulting in\nsignificant consequences, such as financial losses, operational\ndisruptions, or compromised security. Hence, this evolution\ndemands a continuous feed of new or updated rules to counter\nemerging threats. At the same time, the manual nature of\nrule creation significantly limits scalability as the volume and\ncomplexity of threats increase. Every day, large amount of\nCTI is produced, including sandbox output, behavioral logs,\nIndicators of Compromise (IoCs) such as signatures, hash val-\nues, and others\u2013 making manual analysis time consuming [3].\nIn addition to scalability, modern IDS face a fundamental\nchallenge of \u2018rule bloat\u2019. As threat variants evolve, each\ndeviation often necessitates creation of a new rule. This leads\nto an unbounded expansion of the rule base, which strains\nthe computational resources of IDS engines and degrades\nperformance. For IDS to remain efficient, the generation\nof new rules must be balanced with the identification and\nreconciliation of existing ones. Therefore, while generating\nrules, security analysts are tasked not only with analyzing CTI\nfor malicious behavior but also with mapping it to current rule\nsets\u2014either updating existing rules or deprecating outdated\nones. This mapping process requires a significant expertise and\nintroduces an additional layer of complexity into the workflow,\nincreasing the risk of generating erroneous, redundant, or\nsuboptimal rules. Furthermore, IDS platforms for network\nand host environments require fundamentally different rule\nformats tailored to the nature of observed threats.

Here, a CTI is fed as input and\nit outputs a deployable IDS rule while considering existing deployed rules and an Analyst note for assistance and reasoning.\nbased IDS tools like Snort focus on detecting and blocking\nmalicious network traffic. In contrast, host systems based on\nthe popular YARA (Yet Another Recursive Acronym) tool\ncan detect anomalous system-level behavior, such as memory\nanomalies or registry changes, by matching to known textual\nor binary patterns. Comprehensive threat detection requires\nrules that align with the specific capabilities and limitations of\neach target platform (NIDS/HIDS), further complicating and\nslowing the manual rule generation process [4]. The absence\nof automated support limits the agility and accuracy of IDS,\nultimately reducing the overall effectiveness of the system.\nAutonomous generation of IDS rules has been an active\narea of research due to the necessity to reduce the tremendous\namount of manual effort required to develop efficient IDS\nrules. To address these challenges, we propose an Autonomous\nIntrusion Detection Rule Generation framework (FALCON).\nOur approach integrates with machine learning (ML)-based\nsignature and behavior extraction from threat analysis reports\n[5], [6] by employing agentic Large Language Models (LLMs)\nto automate the entire rule-generation pipeline. Given a CTI\ninput containing behavioral descriptions, threat signatures, or\nindicators of compromise (IoCs)\u2014FALCON autonomously\nidentifies and generates deployable IDS rules tailored to net-\nwork or host-based scenarios [refer to Fig. 1]. Additionally,\nit also incorporates rule retrieval and refinement capabilities.\nMore specifically, it can automatically identify existing rules\nthat are functionally similar to the target CTI and decide\nwhether to update existing rules, or generate entirely new ones.\nThis enables efficient rule reuse, facilitates adaptive learning,\nand minimizes rule database bloat\u2014ultimately enhancing IDS\nperformance. All generated rules are subjected to internal\nautomated validation to ensure deployment readiness and\nalignment toward a desired outcome. For example, without any\nground truth, it is challenging to conclude whether the gen-\nerated IDS rule addresses all the functional requirements [7]\ncorresponding to the CTI. Furthermore, for practical deploy-\nment, the rule must match the efficiency of the signature-based\nIDS approach. Therefore, we introduce a novel multi-phase\nvalidation pipeline, including a CTI \u2013 Rule Semantic Scorer\nmodel. The validation pipeline ensures that generated rules are\nsyntactically correct, semantically aligned, and performance-\noptimized for deployment referencing the original CTI. By\nleveraging an agentic approach, FALCON enables rapid, ac-\ncurate rule development and adapts to evolving threats more\nefficiently than traditional manual workflows. As part of this\nwork, we make the following contributions:\n\u2022 We introduce FALCON1, an autonomous IDS rule gener-\nation framework that translates CTI input into actionable\nIDS rules for both Snort and YARA environments.\n\u2022 We propose a novel CTI-to-IDS Rule semantic similarity\nscoring model to quantify the logical or functional align-\nment between threat intelligence and generated rules.\n\u2022 We demonstrate that FALCON can identify existing rules\nand decide whether to generate new rules or update and\nreuse current ones, supporting adaptive and efficient rule\nmanagement.\n\u2022 We construct a publicly available, comprehensive dataset\nof CTIs and corresponding IDS rules to evaluate FAL-\nCON using quantitative metrics and qualitative expert\nvalidation, demonstrating high accuracy and consistency.\n1FALCON Code & Dataset: github.com/shaswata09/falcon\n\n\n\n(fry\n/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nII. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK\nTo provide a foundation for our research, we present the\nnecessary information relevant to this work in this section.\nA. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)\nIntrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are security tools de-\nsigned to monitor computer networks and host systems to\ndetect signs of malicious or unauthorized activity. Due to the\nnature of observing mediums, IDS solutions generally fit into\ntwo categories: Network-based IDS (NIDS) and Host-based\nIDS (HIDS). NIDS inspects network traffic for malicious\nactivity as data traverses the network. At the same time,\nHIDS operates on individual hosts or endpoints, observing\nsystem-level activity and detecting deviations from expected\nbehavior. Likewise, IDS can also be categorized by detection\ntechniques. Among various detection techniques, this work\nfocuses on signature-based IDS, which detects threats by\nmatching observed behavior against a database of known\nattack patterns. Signature-based systems are widely used due\nto their efficiency, low false-positive rate, and effectiveness\nin identifying previously encountered threats. Given their\nrelevance to our research, we limit our focus to Snort for NIDS\nand YARA for HIDS as representative for each IDS.\nB. Use of Large Language Models in Cybersecurity\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), a cornerstone of gener-\native AI, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in au-\ntomating complex text and code synthesis tasks. Built on\nthe Transformer architectures [8] and trained on vast textual\ndatasets, LLMs can understand context, reason over input,\nand produce coherent and human-like outputs. Contempo-\nrary LLMs excel in language translation, query answering,\ndocument summarization, code generation, and other tasks.\nProminent examples of LLMs include OpenAI\u2019s GPT and\nMeta\u2019s Llama models, among others. In the cybersecurity\ndomain, LLMs are increasingly employed to automate domain-\nspecific operations\u2014ranging from pre-processing behavioral\nlogs for information extraction [9], contextualizing threat\nintelligence [10], to generating security test cases [11], among\nothers. While challenges remain around control, accuracy,\nand interpretability, LLMs are emerging as powerful tools for\nreducing manual effort and accelerating response time.\nC. Agentic AI for Autonomous Cyber-defense\nRecent advances in AI have led to the development of agen-\ntic AI systems where models exhibit goal-oriented behavior\nthat generate outputs and autonomously reason, plan, evaluate,\nand refine their actions with minimal human supervision [12],\nmaking them particularly suitable for complex and dynamic\ntasks such as translating CTI [6] into actionable IDS rules,\nvalidate their relevance and syntax, and suggest performance\noptimizations. For example, early works by Fallahi et al.\n[13] employed learning-to-rank models for selecting effective\nYARA rules, these approaches lacked autonomy and evaluative\ndepth. In code generation, this agentic paradigm enables AI\nsystems to interpret description and autonomously generate\ninitial code drafts, verify syntax [7], and iteratively improve\nthem for performance or coverage in real-time [14], assisting\nhuman security analysts to maintain adequate security posture.\nFor instance, recent efforts have employed LLMs to extract\nindicators from behavioral logs [9], [15], or contextualize\nthreat information\n[10]. However, these are often one-shot\ngenerations with limited internal validation or optimization.\nThe move toward agentic pipelines addresses this limitation by\nequipping models with reasoning chains and internal feedback\nloops, leading to more accurate and deployable IDS rules. This\nwork builds upon this emerging direction by proposing an\nagentic, LLM-based framework for fully autonomous IDS rule\ngeneration with internal self-evaluation and feedback loops.\nOur system not only generates Snort or YARA rules from\nCTI but also integrates structured evaluation phases\u2014covering\nsyntax verification, semantic alignment [16], and performance\nimprovement [17], emulating a human analyst.\nIII.

Threat or attack behaviors (B = B1, B2, ..., Bn) consist\nof dynamic patterns, including observed actions such as proto-\ncol usage, file types, or combinations of signatures that charac-\nterize malicious operations. CTI, denoted as C = C1, C2, ..., Cn,\nencapsulates structured or unstructured knowledge that con-\ntains either intrusion signatures (S), malicious behaviors (B),\nor a combination of both.\nHypotheses [Ci\u2229(Si\u222aBi) \u0338= \u2205]: We assume that the anoma-\nlous signatures (Si) and behaviors (Bi) are always accurately\ncaptured in Ci. This hypothesis is necessary because, if the\nCTI does not contain the necessary information required to\ngenerate IDS rules, FALCON will not be able to identify S\nand B to contextualize with existing IDS rules (Re).\n\nProblem Statement\nFor a given set of CTI Ci, the task is to generate a relevant\nIDS rule Ri while considering existing rules Re. Hence, f\ncan be considered as a function that translates C into R,\nwhere Ri \u2229Ci \u0338= \u2205, meaning Ri should correspond to Ci.\nRi = f(Ci, Re) \u2200Ri \u2229Ci \u0338= \u2205\n(1)\nIV. FALCON FRAMEWORK\nWith a defined problem statement, in this section, we\ndescribe our FALCON framework in detail. We begin with the\nsolution approach, followed by a detailed description of each\ninternal system module and its functionality [refer to Fig. 2].\nFinally, we describe the implementation and demonstrate how\nthe modules interact through an example use-case to generate\nthe corresponding IDS rule (Ri) from a given CTI (Ci).\nA. Solution Approach\nThe FALCON framework [refer to Fig. 2] is divided into\ntwo phases for autonomous IDS rule generation and validation.\n\u2013 The Generation Phase initiates with an input CTI (Ci),\nwhich includes threat signatures (Si) and behaviors (Bi).\nThen, the existing deployed IDS rules (Re\ni) that are\nrelevant to Ci are retrieved to provide better context\nfor rule generation. After retrieval of the relevant Re\ni,\nthe Rule Generator LLM Agent receives a generation\ninstruction (I) along with Ci and Re\ni to generate an\ninitial candidate rule (Ri). I contains data extraction\nmethods and generation guidelines that are necessary\nfor an LLM agent to perform. Ri is then sent to\nserial validators to assess its quality. If the rule fails to\nmeet the required validation threshold (T ), it returns\nthe feedback (Fi) to iteratively refine the rule by\nregenerating a new version (Ri+1). This loop continues\nuntil a candidate rule (Ri+n) satisfies all criteria (T ),\nensuring a relevant output (Ri). Iterative feedback loops\nallow incremental refinement [18] of Ri+1 to meet T .\nFinally, a cybersecurity analyst reviews and approves\nvalidated rules before deployment, ensuring compliance\nwith organizational security requirements. The analyst\ncan also provide feedback (F) and initiate re-generation.\n\u2013 The Validation Phase systematically evaluates the gener-\nated rule (Ri) through a serial process involving syntac-\ntic, semantic, and performance validations. Initially, the\nrule undergoes a syntactic check to verify structural cor-\nrectness. If it passes, meaning that the rule is syntactically\nvalid for compilation, then it moves on to semantic analy-\nsis. Semantic analysis assesses the logical consistency and\nfunctional alignment with the provided CTI. Once the rule\npasses the semantic evaluation, performance validation\nensures operational effectiveness of Ri, including aspects\nsuch as mapping with existing IDS rules (Re\ni) for update,\nrun-time efficiency, and detection reliability. At each\nstage, failure to meet validation threshold (T ) results in\nimmediate feedback, allowing targeted improvements in\nthe next iteration of rule generation.\nAlgorithm 1: FALCON Pseudo-code\nInput: Cyber Threat Intelligence (Ci))\nOutput: Relevant IDS Rule (Ri \u2190f(Ci, Re\ni ))\nGENERATION PHASE:\nRe\ni \u2190find relevant rules(Ci)\nRi \u2190generate rule(Ci, Re\ni , \u2205)\nFi \u2190execute validation(Ri, Re\ni )\nwhile Fi < T do\nRi \u2190Ri+1 \u2190generate rule(Ci, Re\ni , Fi)\nFi \u2190Fi+1 \u2190execute validation(Ri, Re\ni )\nreturn Ri\nVALIDATION PHASE [execute validation]:\nFi \u2190\u2205\nFi \u2190Fi \u222asyntactic validator(Ri)\nif Fi < T then\nreturn Fi\nelse\nFi \u2190Fi \u222asemantic validator(Ri)\nif Fi < T then\nreturn Fi\nelse\nFi \u2190Fi \u222aperformance validator(Ri, Re\ni )\nreturn Fi\nB. FALCON System Modules\nTo implement FALCON, we first discuss the system\nmodules, which are Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) or\nC, Relevant IDS Rule Retriever, Generation Prompt, Rule\nGenerator LLM Agent, Generated IDS Rule or (R), Validator\nFeedback or (F), Syntax Validator or Parser, Semantic\nValidator, Performance Validator, Cybersecurity Analyst, and\nOrchestration Agent.\n1) Cyber Threat Inteligence (CTI) or C: CTI serves as the\nprimary input to the FALCON framework. It contains observed\nthreat information comprising signatures (S) and behaviors\n(B), such as IP addresses, hash values, IoCs, protocols, and\nothers. This information, extracted from threat reports or logs,\nforms the semantic basis for rule generation.\n2) Relevant IDS Rule Retriever: The IDS rule retriever is\nresponsible for identifying existing deployed IDS rules (Re\ni) to\nprovide more context to the Rule Generator LLM Agent while\ngenerating new candidate rule (Ri). This retrieval allows the\nRule Generator to decide whether generation of a new IDS rule\nis necessary or updating an existing rule is more efficient.\n3) Generation Prompt: Generation Prompt refers to a com-\nbination of task-specific instructions (I), deployed relevant\nIDS rules (Re\ni), and any feedback (Fi) as an LLM prompt\nto provide the Rule Generator LLM Agent with information\nto develop Ri from Ci. It ensures that generated rules follow\nthe correct syntax, consider threat context, and align with the\ntarget IDS platform (e.g., Snort or YARA).

Validated rules are reviewed by a cybersecurity analyst prior to final deployment.\ntain format specifications, extraction and prioritization logic,\noptimization strategy, and examples for few-shot learning.\n4) Rule Generator LLM Agent: An LLM agent is respon-\nsible for generating Ri based on (C), Re\ni, (I), and F. It is\ncapable of comprehending any feedback, to iteratively refine\nRi by understanding the context of F with respect to C.\n5) Generated IDS Rule or R: Ri is the output of our\nFALCON framework. It is the transformation of a CTI (C)\ninto an actionable IDS rule (R) while considering existing\nIDS rules (Re). The rule may be refined through iterations by\nvalidators until it passes all validation checks (T ).\n6) Validator Feedback or F: The Validator Feedback (F)\nis a validation report from syntax, semantic, and performance\nvalidators or cybersecurity analyst. It has two main purposes:\nto evaluate the generated rules against a defined threshold (T )\nand to provide insights for improving future rule generations.\nHence, F includes a numeric value for comparison with T\nand unstructured descriptive information to assist the Rule\nGenerator LLM Agent and Cybersecurity Analyst.\n7) Syntax Validator: Syntax validator or IDS rule parser\nverifies that the generated IDS rule conforms to the syntactic\nstructure required by the target IDS engine. It checks the cor-\nrectness of rule components such as headers, conditions, and\noptions. If syntax errors are found in generated IDS rule (C),\na negative binary [True/False] feedback value accompanied by\nthe error syntax is returned for regeneration.\n8) Semantic Validator or Parser: The Semantic Validator\nensures that the generated IDS rule (Ri) logically aligns with\nthe CTI (Ci) by verifying whether the rule effectively captures\nthreat indicators (S) and behaviors (B). This involves checking\nfor the presence of essential CTI elements, such as protocols,\npayload signatures, and behavior patterns, and ensuring their\nconsistency with the intended detection objective. Given the\nstructural and representational disparity between CTI (natural\nlanguage) and IDS rules (formal rule syntax), traditional\ncomparison methods such as graph matching is not applicable.\nWhile LLMs can be used for this alignment assessment, their\nreliability is often limited due to issues like hallucination [19]\nand reduced effectiveness over long input contexts [20]. To\naddress this problem, we developed a novel semantic similarity\nscoring model to quantify the logical correspondence between\nthe CTI (C) and IDS rule (R). This approach is inspired\nfrom multi-modal models like OpenAI\u2019s CLIP, which quantify\ncross-modal similarity (e.g., image-text). Specifically, we im-\nplement a Bi-encoder architecture trained to embed both CTI\nand rule representations into a shared latent space for similarity\ncomputation. We describe the model architecture and training\nprocedure in Section IV-C. The resulting similarity score is\nthen fed into a Semantic Analysis LLM Agent, which uses this\nnumerical input alongside structured prompts to detect logical\ninconsistencies in Ri. Sudarshan et al. [18] demonstrated that\nLLM agents guided by context quantification and tailored\ninstructions exhibit improved reasoning and reliability, which\nwe leverage here.\n9) Performance Validator: The Performance Validator as-\nsesses the operational efficiency of the generated IDS rule\n(Ri) for a production environment. It ensures that the rule\ncan effectively detect threats without introducing performance\nbottlenecks. For instance, while matching multiple threat\nsignatures using sequential if-else statements is functional,\nidentifying shared patterns and leveraging regular expressions\nis generally more efficient and scalable. Gao et al. [21]\ndemonstrated that LLM agents can be adapted to evaluate\n\nsuch optimization criteria accurately. Additionally, there may\nbe existing IDS rules that can address a zero-day threat with\nminimal update. Hence, the Performance Validator considers\nmetrics such as execution speed, resource utilization, and\nrule re-usability with detection coverage. Rules exhibiting\nsuboptimal performance, such as excessive processing latency,\nredundant logic or unnecessary addition, are rejected and\nreturned for regeneration with a negative feedback (F). This\nprocess ensures that only high-performing and compatible with\nexisting rules advance in the pipeline.\n10) Cybersecurity Analyst: Serving as the final gatekeeper,\nthe analyst manually reviews validates Ri for correctness,\nrelevance, and safety. Consolidated feedback (F) from last\niteration is returned as analyst note alongside Ri. An analyst\ncan also initiate regeneration with new F. This human-in-the-\nloop element adds a critical layer of trust and accountability.\n11) Orchestration Agent: The orchestration agent manages\nthe interaction between separate modules and decision-making\nthroughout. It tracks rule generation attempts, routes feedback,\nand enforces the threshold criteria (T ) to maintain iterative\nsynchronization between generation-validation phases.\nC. FALCON CTI-Rule Semantic Scorer/Calculator\nA reliable mechanism is required to quantify the functional\nalignment between an IDS rule (Ri) with its corresponding\nCTI (Ci). Existing code similarity models, such as Code-\nBERT [22] or GraphCodeBERT [23], are primarily trained on\ngeneral-purpose programming languages (e.g., Python, Java)\nand focus on structural or syntactic equivalence rather than\nthe intent or logical behavior embedded in CTI and IDS rules.\nThese models are therefore ill-suited for our task, as IDS\nrules (e.g., Snort or YARA) are domain-specific, compact,\nand follow a structured signature-based format rather than\ntraditional code semantics. Moreover, traditional techniques\nsuch as ROUGE [24], BLEU [25], and others fail to capture\nthe nuanced threat relationships between Ci and Ri. This is\nmainly due to significant variation in length and abstraction\nlevels\u2014CTI inputs often contain verbose threat descriptions,\nwhereas IDS rules are succinct and configuration-like. These\ndifferences create a representation mismatch that weakens\nthe performance of traditional similarity metrics. To fill this\ngap, we developed a domain-specific semantic scoring model\nbuilt using a bi-encoder architecture [refer to Figure 3]. This\nmodel independently encodes a CTI input (Ci) and an IDS\nrule (Ri) into fixed-length (768) vector embeddings. We\nthen compute the cosine similarity between these vectors to\ndetermine their semantic alignment. The choice of a bi-encoder\nover a cross-encoder is intentional: bi-encoders are compu-\ntationally efficient for retrieval tasks, scalable for semantic\nsimilarity assessment, better suited for limited training data\nand structured inputs like IDS rules that require fast inference\nwith minimal memory overhead.\nContrastive Fine-Tuning: We full fine-tune a bi-encoder\nmodel (all-mpnet-base-v2) using a contrastive learning ap-\nproach. The objective is to bring semantically aligned\nCTI\u2013IDS rule pairs closer in the embedding space while\npushing unrelated pairs apart. Given a batch of N CTI\u2013rule\npairs (C1, R1), (C2, R2), . . . , (CN, RN), we encode each Ci\nand Ri to obtain embeddings eCi and eRi, respectively. The\ncosine similarity is then computed for each pair:\ncos(Ci, Rj) =\neCi \u00b7 eRj\n\u2225eCi\u2225\u2225eRj\u2225\n(2)\nwhere eCi and eRj are the vector representations of CTI\nand rule respectively, obtained from the bi-encoder. We apply\na softmax over the similarity scores within the batch and\nminimize the cross-entropy (InfoNCE / NT-Xent) loss to\nensure that the model assigns the highest similarity to the\ncorrect (principal diagonal) pair [26]:\nLcontrastive = \u2212\nn\nX\ni=1\nlog\nexp(cos(eCi, eRi)/\u03c4)\nPn\nj=1 exp(cos(eCi, eRj)/\u03c4)\n(3)\nwhere \u03c4 is a temperature hyperparameter that controls\nthe sharpness of the distribution. This formulation not only\nenforces alignment between relevant CTI\u2013Rule pairs but also\nhelps the model distinguish between subtle variations across\nrule formats and detection intents. The model is integrated into\nRelevant IDS Rule Retriever and Semantic Validator module of\nthe FALCON framework, where it provides numeric similarity\nscores to guide retrieval and validation. This approach ensures\na lightweight yet effective semantic alignment mechanism,\nbridging the representational gap between high-level threat\ndescriptions and low-level rule specifications to distinguish\naligned CTI\u2013rule pairs, where it evaluates based on their\nsemantic similarity by quantifying with Sigmoid [0-1] scale.\nD. FALCON Implementation and Module Interaction\nTo demonstrate how FALCON works in practice, we walk\nthrough a concise YARA generation example use-case from\nCTI input (C) to finalized YARA rule (R) through validation.\n1) CTI Ingestion and Rule Generation: The process begins\nwhen a CTI input (Ci) is provided. This input includes\nextracted signatures (Si) such as IP addresses, domain names,\nprotocols, and behavior descriptors (Bi) from threat analysis\nreports. For example, a CTI sample may describe a mal-\nware sample with known headers and known behavior. The\nRelevant IDS Rule Retriever then retrieves any semantically\nsimilar rules (Re\ni) through semantic scorer model and a pre-\ndefined filtration threshold. The Generation Prompt formulates\na structured information tailored for the type of IDS rule\nto be generated (e.g., Snort, YARA) with I paired with Ci\nand Re\ni.

This\nrule typically includes elements such as protocol, IP/domain\nmatch conditions, content matching patterns, and metadata. At\nthis stage, the rule generation is complete but has not yet been\nvalidated for syntactic, semantic (functional), and operational\n(performance) efficiency. Therefore, Ri acts as a candidate that\nwill pass through subsequent layers of automated and human\nanalyst validation before final deployment.\n3) Syntactic Validation: The generated rule is first sent to\nthe Syntax Validator, which parses it to ensure structural and\nsyntactic correctness. This includes checking for adherence\nto Snort or YARA syntax. If errors are detected, feedback\nis returned as Syntactic Validator Feedback (Fs) to initiate\nregeneration. In the following, we provide a sample Fs for\nboth positive and negative use cases.\nSyntactic Validator Feedback (Fs)\n{ \u2013status: True / False,\n\u2014-feedback: \u201cParser Output\u201d \u2013}\n4) Semantic Validation: If (Ri) syntax is valid, then it\nproceeds to the Semantic Validator, where its alignment with\nthe original CTI (Ci) is evaluated. This begins with the CTI-\nRule Semantic Scorer [refer to Section\nIV-C], a bi-encoder\nmodel that quantifies the functional similarity between the CTI\nand IDS rule. The resulting score indicates how well the rule\nsemantically captures the threat described in the CTI. This\nscore is then passed to the Semantic Analysis LLM Agent,\nwhich analyzes Ri driven by the semantic score to identify\npersisting logical inconsistencies or gaps, such as missing\nindicators, incorrect protocols, or irrelevant payload patterns.\nIf critical issues are found, the agent formulates targeted\nfeedback (Ff) for the Rule Generator, prompting a revised\ngeneration cycle. This ensures semantic alignment with itera-\ntive refinement based on detailed contextual understanding.\n\n</>\n\n\n\n\nSemantic Validator Feedback (Ff)\n{ \u2013score: \u201c\u20180.XX\u201d,\n\u2014-status: True / False,\n\u2014-feedback:\n\u2014- \u201c1.

EXPERIMENT & EVALUATION\nIn this section, we present the experiments conducted to\nvalidate our proposed FALCON framework. We designed three\ntypes of evaluation: training and assessing the performance of\nthe CTI-Rule Semantic Scorer [Sec. V-B], evaluation of Rule\nGenerator LLM Agent[Sec. V-C], and end-to-end qualitative\nvalidation of FALCON pipeline [Sec. V-D]. These experiments\naim to validate that an autonomous agentic framework can\ngenerate syntactically correct, semantically accurate, and de-\nployment optimized IDS rules by mining raw CTI data.\nA. Data Description and Experiment Setup\nTo train and evaluate our CTI-Rule Semantic Scorer model\nand end-to-end FALCON pipeline, we collected 4017 Snort2\nand 4587 YARA3 rules from open-source repositories and\nthreat intelligence datasets. Two CTI instances were carefully\ngenerated for each rule, reflecting distinct but relevant threat\nbehavior and signature descriptions. Additionally, we gener-\nated a list of relevant but outdated rules for each rule to test\nout CTI-Rule Semantic Scorer as a retriever. This resulted in\n8034 Snort and 9174 YARA CTI-Rule pairs and 15217 snort\nand 25875 YARA relevant but outdated rules for the retriever\nassessment. The CTI-Rule dataset was then split into 90%\nfor training and 10% for testing (802 Snort and 916 YARA),\nensuring balanced representation across both types of IDS\nrules. From the testing set, 60 Snort and 60 YARA were further\nset aside as a validation set for the overall pipeline\u2019s qualitative\nevaluation. Each rule in the validation set was categorized into\none of three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, or Hard) based\non complexity and length assessments performed by Subject\nMatter Experts (SMEs) which are cybersecurity analysts in\nour case. These CTI and obsolete yet relevant IDS rules were\ndesigned to simulate real-world use cases where FALCON\nmust generate and validate rules from novel CTI inputs\nand existing deployed rules. To simulate diverse operational\ncontexts, CTI was initially tested in both semi-structured\nnatural language and structured STIX 2.0 [27] formats. Our\npreliminary observations indicated that semi-structured CTI\nled to more accurate generation of IDS rules (example in\nSection IV), and we standardized subsequent evaluations on\nsimilar predefined CTI format. However, the CTI schema\nremains flexible and can be adapted to existing cybersecurity\nrequirements, such as STIX or others. The CTI-Rule Semantic\nScorer models were fine-tuned over pre-trained embedding\nmodels using contrastive learning (details in Section IV-C)\nwith a batch size of 64, learning rate of 2 \u00d7 10\u22125, and\nearly stopping based on validation loss. This selection is\nintentional, as our findings with LLM embeddings were poor\nand inefficient. All training was performed on two NVIDIA\nH100 GPUs, and dataset, code, preliminary, and complete\nexperimental results are reported in the repository1.\nB. Semantic Scorer Model Evaluation\nTo evaluate CTI-Rule Semantic Scorer to measure semantic\nsimilarity between the CTI and IDS rules, we opt for a two-\nphase experiment [Table-II]. One is as a retriever, where the\nobjective is to find existing relevant rules for retrieval, and the\nother is to measure semantic similarity between the generated\nrule w.r.t the input CTI. For the retriever evaluation, we used\nRecall@10 and Mean Average Precision (MAP) to assess the\nmodel\u2019s effectiveness in retrieving relevant IDS rules for a\ngiven CTI. In contrast, for the semantic similarity evaluation,\nwe employed diagonal recall\u2014which checks if the similarity\nscore along the principal diagonal (representing the generated\n2Snort (Community): snort.org\n3YARA: github.com/Yara-Rules/rules\n\nPre-Training Evaluation\nContrastive Fine-Tuning\nPost Fine-Tuning Evaluation\nFig. 4: The diagram demonstrates the CTI\u2013Rule Semantic Scorer model\u2019s reliability to semantically map each CTI with its\ncorresponding IDS rule, with the highest similarity scores (observed along the principal diagonal) on 10 validation samples.\npair) is the highest in its row\u2014and a thresholded F1 score,\nwhere we determined the optimal similarity threshold post\napplying scaling function and evaluated the model\u2019s ability\nto distinguish matching from non-matching pairs.\nTABLE II: CTI-Rule Semantic Scorer Evaluation Results\nModel Name\nCase\nRetriever (%)\nSemantic [0-1]\nr@10\nMAP\nRecall\nThres.\nCTI-Rule (Ours)\nSnort\n35.77\n28.24\n0.956\n0.941\nYARA\n34.75\n27.37\n0.930\n0.823\nall-MiniLM-L6-v2\nSnort\n27.80\n20.47\n0.799\n0.338\nYARA\n29.03\n20.94\n0.734\n0.601\nall-mpnet-base-v2\nSnort\n27.01\n19.96\n0.814\n0.319\nYARA\n25.52\n15.41\n0.732\n0.283\ne5-base-v2\nSnort\n12.05\n08.53\n0.479\n0.267\nYARA\n19.35\n13.84\n0.543\n0.267\nBM25\nSnort\n33.23\n25.41\nN/A\nN/A\nYARA\n34.38\n21.85\nN/A\nN/A\nTF-IDF + Cosine\nSnort\n33.92\n25.12\nN/A\nN/A\nYARA\n33.91\n21.32\nN/A\nN/A\nGPT-4o\nSnort\nN/A\nN/A\n0.910\n0.630\nYARA\nN/A\nN/A\n0.909\n0.625\nC. Rule Generator LLM Agent Evaluation\nTo assess the effectiveness of the Rule Generator LLM\nAgent in producing semantically meaningful IDS rules, we\nconducted a comparative evaluation across multiple LLMs of\nvarying parameter sizes\u2014categorized as Large (L), Medium\n(M), and Small (S). The selected models include propitiatory\nGPT-4o and open source Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, Qwen3-32B,\nMistral-Small-24B-Instruct-2501, Granite-3.3-8b-instruct, and\nPhi-4-mini-instruct, evaluated separately for Snort (NIDS) and\nYARA (HIDS) rule generation. The models were prompted\nwith CTI inputs and tasked with generating complete IDS\nrules, which were then evaluated across three semantic sim-\nilarity metrics: CTI-Rule Score (ours), RAGAS [28], and\nBERT-F1 Score. These metrics capture the logical consistency,\nsemantic alignment, and lexical relevance of the generated\nrule w.r.t. input CTI and ground-truth rules. The results,\nsummarized in Table III and IV, demonstrate that agentic\nLLMs can generate relevant IDS rules for deployment in\nresource-constrained scenarios.\nTABLE III: CTI vs Generated Rule Evaluation Results [0-1]\nfor the Rule Generator Using Different LLMs of Various Sizes.\nSize\nModel\nParam.\nCTI-Rule\nRagas\nBert-F1\nNIDS - Snort\nL\nGPT-4o\nUnknown\n0.7217\n0.8648\n0.6106\nM\nLlama-3.3\n70B\n0.7218\n0.8794\n0.6161\nQwen 3\n32.8B\n0.7219\n0.8790\n0.6162\nS\nMistral\n24B\n0.7219\n0.8793\n0.6163\nGranite\n8.17B\n0.7208\n0.8797\n0.6155\nPhi 4\n3.84B\n0.7206\n0.8780\n0.6131\nHIDS - YARA\nL\nGPT-4o\nUnknown\n0.7009\n0.9355\n0.7585\nM\nLlama-3.3\n70B\n0.7245\n0.9004\n0.7270\nQwen 3\n32.8B\n0.7247\n0.9228\n0.7233\nS\nMistral\n24B\n0.7256\n0.9252\n0.7741\nGranite\n8.17B\n0.7246\n0.9169\n0.7234\nPhi 4\n3.84B\n0.7220\n0.9171\n0.7056\nD. FALCON Pipeline Evaluation\nUsing our 60 validation samples, we evaluated the end-\nto-end feasibility of the FALCON pipeline. Each CTI was\nprocessed through the Rule Generator LLM Agent, followed\nby evaluations for syntactic, semantic, and performance val-\nidation. To assess the quality of generated Snort and YARA\nrules, we utilized a Likert scale, with evaluations conducted\nindependently by three cybersecurity Subject Matter Experts\n(SMEs). Each generated rule was evaluated according to:\nnon-match (Score = 0), syntactically correct (Score = 1),\nsemantically correct (Score = 2) and performance optimized\n(Score = 3) criteria. The evaluation results are summarized in\nTable V. SME scores (ranging from 0 to 3) were aggregated\nwithin each difficulty category and average scores in [0-1]\nscale were calculated to measure consensus. We observed\nsubstancial agreement among SMEs with 84%, indicating the\nconsistency and reliability of our FALCON framework.\n\nLoss\n\n0.200\n\n0.175\n\n0.150\n\n0.125\n\n0.100\n\n0.075\n\n0.050\n\n0.025\n\nLoss vs Epoch\n\n10\n\n15\nEpoch\n\n20\n\n25\n\n\nDescriptions\n\nSoftmax Attention Weights: Descriptions > Rules\n0.088 0.084 0.088 0.093 0.098 0.085 0.091 0.085 0.079\n\nDesc 2 - 0.087 0.077 0.085 0.087 0.1 0.095 0.085 0.088 0.20\n\nDesc 3 - 0.082 0.098 0.086 0.086 0.097 0.079 0.09 018\n\nDesc 4 - 0.087 0.077 0.078 0.11 0.088 0.084 0.079 0.087\n\nDesc 5- 0.09 0.087 0.093 0.08 O11 01 0.08 one\nDesc 6- 0.092 0.09 0.081 0.093 0.099 0.087 0.083 0.14\nDesc 7- 0.086 0.1 0.081 0.084 0.078 0.082 0.086 0.092 re\nDesc 8 - 0.085 0.091 0.092 0.074 0.11 0.094\n\nDesc 9 - 0.087 0.083 0.076 0.072 0.1 0.092 por0\nDesc 10 - 0.083 0.09 0.086 0.086 0.082 0.089 - 0.08\n\nRule 1 -\nRule 2 -\nRule 3 -\nRule 4\nRule 5\nRule 6\nRule 7 \u2014\nRule 8 \u2014\nRule 9\nRule 10\n\nSnort Rules\n\n\nDescriptions\n\nDesc 1 er\n\nDesc 2 - 0.097\n\nDesc 3 - 0.097\n\nDesc 4 - 0.097\n\nDesc 5 - 0.097\n\nDesc 6 - 0.097\n\nDesc 7 - 0.099\n\nDesc 8 - 0.095\n\nDesc 9 - 0,099\n\nDesc 10 ~ 0.096\n\nRule 1 -,\n\nSoftmax Attention Weights: Descriptions > Rules\n\n0,099 0.098 0.096\n\n0.09\n\n0.087\n0.096\n0.092\n0.098\n0.094\n0.095\n\n0.091\n\nRule 2 -\n\nO21\n\nO21\n\no1\n\n0.097 0.092\n\n0.099\n\no1\n\n0.097\n\n0.099\n\n0.097\n\n0.097\n\nRule 4 -|\n\n01 0.097\n01 0.093\n0.1 0.099\n0.1 0.099\n(eEN) 0.098\n01 (eer\n0.1 0.099\n\n0.098\n01 0.098\n\n0.094 0.097\n\no \u00a9\n\nSnort Rules\n\n01 O01 O12\n01 o1 O12\n01 O01 O12\n\n0.099 O01 O21\no1 oar | o1\n01 O01 O12\n0.11 aos\nCem 0.11 se\n01 01 [eer\n\n0.1 0.099 0.098\n\nRule 7 -|\nRule 8 -|\nRule 9 -|\n\n0.084\n\n0.085\n\n0.089\n\n0.087\n\n0.083\n\n0.086\n\n0.086\n\n0.086\n\n0.085\n\n0.13\n\nRule 10\n\n0.12\n\nO11\n\n- 0.10\n\n- 0.09\n\n\u00bb>\n\nFig. 5: The diagram illustrates the reliability of our FALCON framework and the CTI\u2013Rule Semantic Scorer model (Green\nLine) in both generating accurate Snort and YARA IDS rules and evaluating them based on functional similarity.

Discussion\nThe experimental results support our core hypothesis that\nAgentic LLMs can autonomously generate deployable IDS\nrules from CTI reports. Through the evaluation, we made\nseveral observations. (1) Even though the CTI-Rule model\nperformed better compared to other retrievers, it is not a\nsubstantial improvement from an efficiency standpoint. Hence,\nwe concluded that an ensemble (sparse + dense) retriever\nwith ranking would be an efficient approach for retrieval\ntasks. As often, sparse (TF-IDF) works better due to data\noverlap. (2) Modern LLMs, regardless of size, are capable\nof mining relevant information from CTI and generating IDS\nrules, provided CTI contains all necessary information. (3)\nWe observed that large and mid-sized LLMs often generated\nbetter results at first-shot generation, passing the validation.\nIn contrast, smaller models, such as Mistral or Phi, often\nrequire 2\u20133 iterations to arrive at a valid rule due to errors\nin their initial outputs. This iterative refinement, triggered\nby feedback from the syntax validator, led to more accurate\nrules. This observation highlights that LLMs significantly\nbenefit from structured, directed feedback loops, enabling\nthem to converge toward higher-quality outputs. (4) The key\nfinding emerged from our comparative evaluation of semantic\nsimilarity metrics: RAGAS tended to overestimate seman-\ntic similarity, while BERT-F1 underestimated it. In contrast,\nour CTI-Rule Semantic Scorer consistently captured logical\nconsistency between CTI and generated rules in the right\nproportion. This was evidenced in all four evaluation graphs\n[Refer to Fig. 5] (Snort and YARA, generated IDS rule vs.\ninput CTI and generated IDS rule vs. ground-truth IDS rule),\nwhere our model produced nearly identical trends (green line)\nacross both comparisons. If the scorer were not truly grounded\nin logical similarity, the two graphs (1st to 3rd and 2nd to\n4th) would diverge, as observed in RAGAS and BERT-F1.\nThis consistency provides strong evidence that our semantic\nscorer is not merely matching surface-level lexical patterns, but\nis in fact representing logical relationships in latent space\u2014\na crucial step toward explainable, functionally meaningful\nevaluation of IDS rule generation. Moving forward, future\nwork should not only refine the semantic similarity models and\nbuild more advanced validation agents capable of delivering\nnuanced feedback, but also expand to incorporate multi-modal\nCTI sources and integrate live threat feedback. This would\nenable continuous adaptation of the framework, supporting\nlarge-scale, real-time refinement of IDS rule bases, and further\nstrengthening cyber-defense capabilities.\n\nScore\n\n1.00\n\n0.95\n\n0.90\n\n0.85\n\n0.80\n\n0.75\n\n0.70\n\n0.65\n\n0.60\n\nInput CTI vs Generated Snort Rule\n\ne CTIRute\n-@ Ragas\nOe BenFl\n\n\u2014_\u2014\n\nNeen SEEEEEEEE: SaEEEEEED aE meee\n\nGPT-4o0  LLaMA-3.3 Qwen-3 Mistral Granite Phi-4\nLLMs\n\nGPT-40\n\nInput CTI vs Generated YARA Rule\n\nLLaMA-3.3\n\nQwen-3\nLLMs\n\nMistral\n\n\u00a9 CTIRute\n-@ Ragas\n@ BenFl\n\n\u201cN\"<M\u201c<UUXU\u2122\"S TT\n\nGranite\n\nPhi-4\n\nGround Truth Snort vs Generated Snort\n\nee ee a\n\n=e CTERute\n-@ Ragas\nOe Bert-F1\n\nGPT-40\n\nLLaMA-3.3\n\nQwen-3\nLLMs\n\nMistral\n\nGranite\n\nPhi-4\n\nGround Truth YARA vs Generated YARA\n\ne CTIRute\n\nGPT-40\n\nLLaMA-3.3\n\nQwen-3\nLLMs\n\nMistral\n\nGranite\n\nPhi-4\n\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we presented FALCON, an agentic framework\nthat leverages LLM-powered modules to automate the gener-\nation and validation of IDS rules by mining CTI information.\nAddressing the critical challenge of rapid and accurate IDS\nrule development to address evolving cyber threats, FALCON\nstreamlines the traditionally manual and error-prone rule en-\ngineering process. Through its modular pipeline, including\na rule generator, syntactic\u2013semantic\u2013performance validators,\nand a novel semantic similarity scorer, FALCON ensures the\ncorrectness, relevance, and operational soundness of each rule\nbefore deployment. Our experiments on Snort and YARA\ndatasets demonstrate the framework\u2019s robustness and adapt-\nability, achieving strong agreement with human analysts while\nalso revealing that logical relationships can be represented\nin latent space. Specifically, our CTI\u2013Rule Semantic Scorer\nconsistently captured functional alignment across generated\nrules, CTI inputs, and ground-truth rules\u2014unlike conventional\nmetrics such as RAGAS or BERT-F1\u2014providing evidence\nthat explainable logic-aware evaluation is feasible in IDS\ncontexts. This finding underscores FALCON \u2019s potential not\nonly for automation but also for enhancing explainability and\ncontinual learning in intrusion detection systems. Future work\ncan further expand FALCON by incorporating multi-modal\nCTI sources and integrating live threat feedback, enabling\ncontinuous adaptation and refinement of IDS rulebases for\nreal-time, large-scale cyber defense.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Sean Blanton.\n90+ 2024 cybersecurity statistics and trends.\nhttps://\njumpcloud.com/blog/cyber-attack-statistics-trends, 2024.\n[2] Eze Esther Chinwe and Chisom Elizabeth Alozie.

These examples fail to account for\nboth model-speci\ufb01c knowledge distributions and the intrinsic\ncomplexity of the tasks, resulting in suboptimal and unsta-\nble model performance. To address this, we propose a novel\nframework inspired by the pedagogical principle of \u201ctailored\nteaching with balanced dif\ufb01culty\u201d. We reframe prompt se-\nlection as a prompt curriculum design problem: construct-\ning a well ordered set of training examples that align with\nthe model\u2019s current capabilities. Our approach integrates two\ncomplementary signals: (1) model-perceived dif\ufb01culty, quan-\nti\ufb01ed through prediction disagreement in an active learning\nsetup, capturing what the model itself \ufb01nds challenging; and\n(2) intrinsic sample complexity, which measures the inher-\nent dif\ufb01culty of each question\u2013image pair independently of\nany model. By jointly analyzing these signals, we develop\na dif\ufb01culty-balanced sampling strategy that ensures the se-\nlected prompt examples are diverse across both dimensions.\nExtensive experiments conducted on \ufb01ve challenging bench-\nmarks and multiple popular Multimodal Large Language\nModels (MLLMs) demonstrate that our method yields sub-\nstantial and consistent improvements and greatly reduces per-\nformance discrepancies caused by random sampling, provid-\ning a principled and robust approach for enhancing multi-\nmodal reasoning.\nIntroduction\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) (Yin et al.\n2024; Liu et al. 2023) have emerged prominent research\nfocus alongside the rapid advancement of arti\ufb01cial intel-\nligence. Built upon powerful foundation language models\n(Touvron et al. 2023; Bai et al. 2023), MLLMs leverage\ncross-modal alignment mechanisms to achieve understand-\ning and processing of information across multiple modal-\nities, including text, images, videos, and audio. A typi-\n*These authors contributed equally.\n\u2020Corresponding authors.\nFigure 1: The simpli\ufb01ed \ufb02owchart of CAMS and its effects\ncal approach to deploying MLLMs is the in-context learn-\ning paradigm\n(Brown et al. 2020; Xie and Min 2022),\nwhich drives models to perform predictions by providing\na large number of instructions and input-output pair exam-\nples. Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al. 2022; Zhou et al. 2022)\nenhances the logical reasoning capability of models by con-\nstructing examples that decompose complex problems into\nstep-by-step subproblems and solve them sequentially. Mul-\ntimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) (Zhang et al. 2023), on\nthe other hand, further extends this core idea to the applica-\ntion scenarios of multimodal large language models, achiev-\ning an improvement in cross-modal reasoning capabilities.\nMCoT encourages large language models to perform\nmulti-step reasoning by providing explicit problem-solving\nrationales, rather than mapping questions directly to an-\nswers. This approach has been effectively applied to sci-\nenti\ufb01c question answering across domains such as natural\nsciences, linguistic sciences, and social sciences (Lu et al.\n2022; Chen et al. 2024; Goyal et al. 2017; Marino et al.\narXiv:2508.18673v1  [cs.CL]  26 Aug 2025\n\n\nLlama3.2-vision:11b\n\neee\n\n(b)\n\n|\n| | 80.\nI\n|\n|\n|\nI\n|\n|\n| 60\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| 40\n| | |\n. = |\ni a\nI + i! |\n.

However, as illustrated in Fig-\nure 2(a), MCoT prompt examples are typically randomly se-\nlected or manually crafted without considering the model\u2019s\ninternal knowledge distribution or the characteristics of the\ndataset. This leads to prompts that are unstable and insuf-\n\ufb01ciently tailored to the model or task. As a result, MCoT\nprompting often suffers from poor generalization, halluci-\nnated outputs, and inconsistent performance. To enhance the\nspeci\ufb01city and effectiveness of prompt examples, Auto-CoT\n(Zhang et al. 2022) constructs prompts by selecting repre-\nsentative examples via clustering, as shown in Figure 2(b).\nHowever, due to the inherent differences between modali-\nties, the effectiveness of Auto-CoT in multimodal scenarios\nis limited. It fails to adequately account for the distributional\ndifferences in internal knowledge across different models.\nThese challenges raise a critical question: how to selec-\ntively identify the most effective multimodal prompt exam-\nples? In human learning, individuals often compile person-\nalized sets of challenging problems ranging from basic mis-\nunderstandings due to knowledge gaps to complex tasks that\nrequire multi-step reasoning. Inspired by the idiom \u201cTailor\nteaching to individual needs\u201d, we treat each multimodal\nlarge model as a unique learner and select prompt examples\nthrough two dimensions: uncertainty analysis and complex-\nity evaluation.\nWe propose CAMS (Complexity-Guided Active Multi-\nmodal CoT Sampling), a novel joint selection framework\nthat integrates active learning and data complexity assess-\nment. Rather than relying on randomly selected or manually\ncrafted MCoT examples, CAMS constructs a tailored \u201cer-\nror sets\u201d for each model based on the training sets of various\nreasoning tasks, aiming to enhance the models\u2019 performance\non test sets. As shown in Figure 2(c), CAMS identi\ufb01es\nhighly targeted, effective, and dif\ufb01culty-balanced prompt\nexamples by jointly analyzing sample uncertainty and com-\nplexity. Figure 1(a) illustrates the core work\ufb02ow of CAMS,\nwhile Figure 1(b) highlights its perforamance advantages.\nWe conduct experiments on \ufb01ve benchmark datasets and\nthree multimodal large models. The results show that CAMS\nboth improves model performance and greatly reduces accu-\nracy variability caused by random prompt selection. Our key\ncontributions are as follows:\n\u2022 We introduce CAMS,the \ufb01rst framework to select prompt\nexamples based on both model-internal knowledge and\ndataset characteristics.\n\u2022 We demonstrate that effective prompting requires a bal-\nance of easy and hard examples; neither extreme is suf\ufb01-\ncient on its own.\n\u2022 CAMS greatly reduces the instability of traditional\nprompt selection methods and enables MLLMs to\nachieve stable, high performance on complex reasoning\ntasks.\nRelated Work\nPrompt Selection based on Active Learning\nActive learning is a machine learning paradigm focused on\nmaximizing model performance using the fewest possible\nlabeled samples. It aims to identify the most informative un-\nlabeled data points for annotation, thereby reducing label-\ning costs while maintaining high accuracy. Active learning\nmethods are typically grouped into the following three cate-\ngories based on how unlabeled data is queried: membership\nquery synthesis (Angluin 1988; King et al. 2004), where\nthe model generates new instances for labeling; stream-\nbased selective sampling (Dagan and Engelson 1995; Kr-\nishnamurthy 2002), where data points are evaluated one at a\ntime for potential labeling; and pool-based sampling (Lewis\n1995), where the model selects the most informative sam-\nples from a large pool of unlabeled data.\nActive Prompt (Diao et al. 2023) applies active learning\nprinciples to prompt selection by quantifying uncertainty\nthrough prediction disagreement metrics (e.g., variance, en-\ntropy, disagreement) and choosing high-uncertainty samples\nas prompt examples. However, Active Prompt focuses solely\non model\u2019s prediction disagreement with samples (i.e., dis-\ntributional differences in model-internal knowledge) without\nconsidering sample complexity. Our approach introduces a\ndata complexity evaluator that assesses the inherent dif\ufb01-\nculty of samples. This allows for more customized and effec-\ntive prompt selection, combining insights from both model\nknowledge and dataset characteristics.\nChain-of-Thought in Visual Question Answering\nThe Multimodal Chain of Thought (CoT) technique is\nwidely adopted to enhance the multi-step reasoning abil-\nities of large language models (LLMs). Its core idea\nis to guide models to generate intermediate reasoning\nsteps that help them solve complex problems more ef-\nfectively. Benchmarks such as VQA (Antol et al. 2015),\nVQAv2 (Goyal et al. 2017), OK-VQA (Marino et al. 2019),\nA-OKVQA (Schwenk et al. 2022), and ScienceQA (Lu\net al. 2022) provide structured visual question answer-\ning (VQA) tasks across various domains, including natu-\nral science, social science, semantics, and everyday rea-\nsoning. For complex reasoning tasks, recent approaches\nlike MCoT (Zhang et al. 2023), Auto-CoT (Zhang et al.\n2022), Self-Consistency (Wang et al. 2022), and Active\nPrompt (Diao et al. 2023) leverage carefully designed\nprompt examples to improve model performance.\nDespite these advancements, many methods (Wei et al.\n2022; Wang et al. 2022; Zhou et al. 2022) rely on either ran-\ndomly selected or manually crafted prompt examples. These\nexamples often fail to align with the speci\ufb01c demands of\nindividual VQA tasks, limiting model performance. In par-\nticular, they tend to overlook key factors such as the distri-\nbutional characteristics of the model\u2019s internal knowledge\nand the multimodal nature of VQA tasks, focusing primar-\nily on unimodal scenarios. To address these limitations, our\nframework jointly considers the model\u2019s uncertainty about\nthe dataset and the intrinsic complexity of each example. By\nintegrating both model-centric and data centric perspectives,\nwe dynamically construct prompt examples that are better\ntailored to the model\u2019s current capabilities and the reason-\ning requirements of the task, leading to more effective and\nadaptive prompting in visual question answering.\n\nFigure 2: Illustration of the motivation and key highlights of our proposed framework. (a) CoT uses random/manual prompts\nwithout analyzing model knowledge distribution or dataset features; (b) Auto-CoT uses clustering for representative prompts\nbut ignores inter-model knowledge differences; (c) CAMS (Ours) screens optimal prompts via active learning uncertainty and\ncomplexity analysis, balancing dif\ufb01culty to enhance effectiveness. We adopt the same multimodal input consisting of images\nand questions as in (a) and (b) for CAMS.\nMethodology\nFigure 3 illustrates the three core modules of CAMS:\n(i) Analysis of Multimodal Model Internal Knowledge,\nwhich quanti\ufb01es the model\u2019s predictive uncertainty through\nmultiple independent samplings of the model, revealing the\ndistribution characteristics of the model\u2019s internal knowl-\nedge; (ii) Complexity-Based Dataset Feature Estimation,\nwhich is used to quantitatively evaluate dataset characteris-\ntics; (iii) Examples Sampling Strategy, which incorporates\nmodel uncertainty indicators, dataset complexity scores, and\nthe \u201ceasy-hard\u201d selection principle to dynamically identify\nthe most representative and effective prompt examples for\nthe target model.\nProblem De\ufb01nition\nWe de\ufb01ne a visual question answering dataset as D =\n{(xi, vi, yi)}N\ni=1, where xi represents the linguistic text\nquery, vi represents the corresponding visual image input,\nyi denotes the ground truth, and N is the total number of\ntest samples. The goal of the prompt optimization task is to\nsearch for the optimal prompt p\u2217that maximizes the perfor-\nmance A(\u00b7) of large language models (LLMs) on a given\ntask. This task can be formally de\ufb01ned as:\np\u2217= argmax\np\u2208Pspace\nN\nX\ni=1\nS(A(xi, vi; p), yi)\n(1)\nwhere Pspace denotes the set of all possible prompts (auto-\nmatically selected or manually crafted), and S represents the\ncorresponding evaluation metric.\nAnalysis of Multimodal Model Internal Knowledge\nDisagrement.\nWe de\ufb01ne the training sample set as\nDtrain = {q1, q2, ..., qn}, where qi denotes an unlabeled\nsample and n is the total number of training samples.

For each\ninstruction sample I , we enhance its complexity through\nTechnique F\u03b1(\u00b7), which involves adding constraints, speci-\n\ufb01cation, and increasing reasoning steps. After N iterations,\na set of instructions with varying complexities is obtained:\n{(I(0)\ni\n, R(0)\ni ), (I(1)\ni\n, R(1)\ni ), ..., (I(M)\ni\n, R(M)\ni\n)}\n(6)\nwhere I(m)\ni\n= F\u03b1(I(m\u22121)\ni\n) and N is set to 5. Further, we\nutilize the scoring function S(\u00b7) (i.e. ChatGPT) to rate and\nrank these 6 samples, generating a set of instructions with\nscoring labels:\n{(I(j)\ni\n, S(I(j)\ni\n), R(j)\ni )}M\nj=0\n(7)\nComposed of these labeled instruction groups, a dataset is\nconstructed to train llava as the \ufb01nal complexity scorer.\nTextual Substitution for Visual Content.\nThis scheme\naims to convert images in multimodal data into text form\n(image captions) and integrate them with question texts to\nform unimodal inputs, enabling the reuse of existing uni-\nmodal complexity scorers.

In each setting, the best results are displayed in bold and italics, with gray\nshading indicating the degree of improvement compared to ZS-CoT.\ncult and error-prone, we select an equal number of high-\ncomplexity and low-complexity questions; this balanced se-\nlection criterion is equally applied to subsets of simple and\nfundamental questions. To elaborate, we take n = 4 as ex-\nample. Let the uncertainty metrics be u1 = 4, u2 = 3, u3 =\n2, u4 = 1. The training sample set after categorization can\nbe formalized as Dn\ntrain = {D4, D3, D2, D1}, where D4 and\nD3 are de\ufb01ned as dif\ufb01cult and error-prone question subsets\nowing to their high uncertainty metrics, while D2 and D1\nare classi\ufb01ed as simple and fundamental question subsets\ndue to their low uncertainty metrics. When selecting four\ntraining samples as prompt examples, one feasible strategy\nis to choose questions with the highest complexity scores\nfrom D4 and D2, paired with questions with the lowest com-\nplexity scores from D3 and D1. Alternatively, an inverse se-\nlection scheme can be adopted: selecting questions with the\nhighest complexity scores from D3 and D1, and those with\nthe lowest complexity scores from D4 and D2.\nExperiments\nIn this section, we conduct extensive experiments to vali-\ndate the effectiveness of CAMS (Complexity-Guided Ac-\ntive Multimodal CoT Sampling). Our experiments aim to\naddress the following core questions:\nQ1. Compared with existing baseline methods, can CAMS\nimprove the accuracy of \ufb01nal answers?\nQ2. Can CAMS eliminate the instability of randomly select-\ning prompt examples?\nQ3. Are the designs of our two modules (active learning and\ncomplexity scoring) both meaningful?\nQ4. Can CAMS enhance the accuracy of multimodal large\nmodels in subdivided domains?\nQ5. Why should we select examples with uniform uncer-\ntainty for multimodal large models?\nExperimental Settings\nDatasets and Metrics.\nFollowing the standard evaluation\nsettings in MLLMs reasoning research,we conduct testing\non \ufb01ve popular benchmarks: ScienceQA (Lu et al. 2022), A-\nOKVQA (Schwenk et al. 2022), OK-VQA (Marino et al.\n2019), VQAv2 (Goyal et al. 2017) and TextVQA (Singh\net al. 2019). The problem designs in these datasets include\nboth multiple-choice and open-ended answer formats, and\nwe follow the practice (Liu et al. 2024; Li et al. 2024; Bai\net al. 2023) of using accuracy as the metric.\nBaselines and Model Variants.\nIn our experiment, the\nfollowing \ufb01ve methods are used as the main baselines:\nChain-of-thought (ZS-CoT) (Wei et al. 2022), Few shot CoT\n(FS-CoT), Self-consistency (Self-Con) (Wang et al. 2022),\nAuto-CoT (Zhang et al. 2022) and Active Prompt (Active-\nPro) (Diao et al. 2023). FS-CoT uses the same annotation\nprocess as our method, the only difference being that it\nrandomly selects questions from the training data for an-\nnotation. We select multiple cutting-edge MLLMs as ex-\nperimental models, including llama3.2-vision:11b,\nllava:7b, and Qwen2.5-VL:7b.\n\nFigure 4: Accuracy \ufb02uctuations across \ufb01ve tests of FS-CoT and CAMS, where Test 1\u20135 denote the serial numbers of each test.\nImplementation Details\nHyperparameters.\nFor each dataset, we set the number\nof prompt examples to 4. In the training set sampling phase,\nwe set the number of sampling iterations to 5. During both\nthe sampling and the inference phases of the experiments,\nthe temperature is uniformly set at 0.5. Unless otherwise\nspeci\ufb01ed, the multimodal large language models used in the\nexperiments are llama3.2-vision:11b, llava:7b,\nand Qwen2.5-VL:7b.\nUncertainty Assessment.\nIn the experimental process, we\nadopt a zero-shot sampling strategy, which does not rely\non additional examples or guidance information. For Sci-\nenceQA, A-OKVQA, and VQA, we perform sampling on\nthe complete training sample sets, while for the VQAv2 and\nTextVQA datasets, we only sample 10,000 samples. For the\nsampling frequency parameter, we set K = 5. We consis-\ntently use \u201cDisagreement\u201d1\u2014a more intuitive and accurate\nmethod\u2014as the uncertainty metric.\nConstructing Examples.\nWe focus on the innovating and\noptimizating strategies for prompt example selection. To re-\nduce human labor as much as possible, we eliminate the\nneed for manual annotation of prompt examples. Instead,\nwe construct prompt instances by directly concatenating the\nquestion, reasoning, and answer from the dataset. Details are\nprovided in Appendix A.\nMain Results\nFor\nQ1:\nCAMS\nconsistently\noutperforms\nnearly\nall\nbaseline\nmethods.\nAmong\nthe\nthree\nmodels\n\u2014\nLlama3.2-vision:11b,\nLlava:7b,\nand\nQwen2.5-VL:7b \u2014 the average accuracy (Avg.) of\nthe proposed method consistently outperforms nearly\nall baseline methods. As shown in Table 1, taking\nLlama3.2-vision:11b as an example: our method\nachieves an average score approximately 45.38 points\nhigher than that of ZS-CoT, and more than 5 points\nhigher than those of Auto-CoT, Active Prompt, and self-\nconsistency. The best-performing FS-CoT is around 2 points\n1In preliminary experiments, variance and entropy exhibit sub-\noptimal performance in multimodal scenarios.\nlower than CAMS. This indicates that CAMS can stably\nenhance the performance of multimodal large models on\ncomplex multimodal reasoning tasks, demonstrating robust\neffectiveness compared to existing baseline methods across\ndiverse model con\ufb01gurations.\nFor Q2: CAMS can greatly reduce accuracy instability\ncaused by randomly selecting prompt examples.\nTo en-\nsure the fairness and reliability of the experiments, \ufb01ve tests\nare conducted on the FS-CoT method using different ran-\ndom seeds on the test set, with the average accuracy across\nthe \ufb01ve tests selected as the \ufb01nal result. Figure 4 illustrates\nthe speci\ufb01c performance of FS-CoT in these \ufb01ve tests. The\nline chart reveals that the random selection strategy exhibits\nsigni\ufb01cant instability, with substantial \ufb02uctuations in accu-\nracy across tests \u2014 the difference between the highest and\nlowest accuracy exceeds 5. CAMS not only signi\ufb01cantly re-\nduces the impact of randomness on performance but also\nconsistently achieves above-average accuracy, outperform-\ning the random selection strategy across the board.\nMETHOD\nDatasets\nAvg.\nScienceQA\nA-\nOKVQA\nOK-\nVQA\nVQAv2\nTextVQA\nLlama3.2-vision:11b\nZS-CoT\n38.08\n47.42\n28.74\n57.45\n37.52\n41.84\nUnc-Eva\n63.40\n56.68\n43.65\n59.75\n61.32\n56.96\nCom-Eva\n61.92\n55.92\n48.10\n60.66\n60.40\n57.40\nOurs\n68.22\n59.39\n51.89\n61.89\n62.76\n60.83\nTable 2: Results of ablation study (%) on \ufb01ve benchmarks.\nUnc-Eva selects examples randomly only from different un-\ncertainty categories.

Com-\npared with the baseline method, both the standalone Unc-\nEva module and Com-Eva module enhance model accuracy\nin complex reasoning tasks to varying degrees. The Unc-\nEva module demonstrates better performance across differ-\nent disciplinary types and dif\ufb01culty levels compared to the\nCom-Eva module. The Com-Eva module, while eliminating\nrandomness, still improves model performance and ensures\ndata stability and reliability. The experimental results indi-\ncate that the proposed method effectively combines the ad-\nvantages of both modules, further enhancing model accuracy\nwhile mitigating randomness.\nFor Q4: CAMS can improve the model\u2019s accuracy in\nsubdivided domains.\nTo further investigate the ef\ufb01cacy\nof CAMS in speci\ufb01c sub\ufb01elds, we conduct systematic ex-\nperiments on the ScienceQA dataset. Speci\ufb01cally, based on\ndisciplinary attributes, the ScienceQA dataset is categorized\ninto three major groups: natural sciences (NAT), social sci-\nences (SOC), and linguistic sciences (LAN). According to\ndif\ufb01culty gradients, it is also divided into two levels: grades\n1\u20136 (G1-6) and grades 7\u201312 (G7-12), thus constructing mul-\ntidimensional subscenarios that capture both domain speci-\n\ufb01city and cognitive complexity. As shown in Figure 6, in the\n\ufb01ve sub\ufb01elds mentioned above, CAMS almost universally\noutperforms the three baseline methods - Self-con, ZS-CoT,\nand FS-CoT - in terms of precision, especially in the NAT,\nSOC, and G1-6 domains. Whether in knowledge-centric sce-\nnarios emphasizing disciplinary dimensions or in learning\nsettings focused on dif\ufb01culty levels, CAMS demonstrates\nsigni\ufb01cant advantages, con\ufb01rming its ability to substantially\nimprove model accuracy within specialized domains.\nFor Q5: A selection strategy that combines easy and dif-\n\ufb01cult examples is more bene\ufb01cial to the model.\nTo eval-\nuate the effectiveness of combining easy and dif\ufb01cult exam-\nples, we conducte additional experiments using two addi-\ntional selection strategies: one that includes only dif\ufb01cult ex-\namples (i.e., those with high uncertainty) and another that in-\ncludes only easy examples (i.e., those with low uncertainty).\nAs shown in Figure 6, while the all-dif\ufb01cult example strat-\negy performs relatively well across the \ufb01ve target datasets, it\nstill falls short compared to the balanced strategy employed\nby CAMS. This \ufb01nding highlights that relying exclusively\non either high- or low-dif\ufb01culty samples is insuf\ufb01cient to\ncapture the full spectrum of knowledge complexity and sce-\nnario diversity required for complex reasoning tasks. In con-\ntrast, CAMS\u2019s approach of integrating both easy and dif\ufb01-\ncult examples enables the model to learn more diverse and\nrepresentative knowledge patterns, ultimately leading to im-\nproved reasoning accuracy.\nConclusion and Future Work\nIn this work, we address key challenges in existing Chain-\nof-Thought (CoT) prompting methods for multimodal mod-\n\n\nLlama3.2-vision:11b\n\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n\n10.\n\ni,\n\nti)\n\nNAT LAN G1-6\nSelf-Con || ZS-CoT |) FS-CoT\n\nG7-12\n- Ours\n\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n\nLlava:7b\n\nNAT SOc LAN G1-6 G7-12\nSelf-Con |) ZS-CoT |) FS-CoT ~+ Ours\n\nQwen2.5-VL:7b\n\n90\n\n80\n70.\n\n60\n50\n40\n30)\n20\n\nNAT SOc LAN G1-6 G7-12\nSelf-Con || ZS-CoT (|| FS-CoT ~ Ours\n\n\n\nLlama3.2-vision:11b Llava:7b Qwen2.5vl:7b\n\nScienceQA ScienceQA ScienceQA\n\nTextVQA A-OKVQA TextVQA A-OKVQA TextVQA A-OKVQA\n\nVQAv2 OKVQA VQAv2 OKVQA VQAv2 OKVQA\n\nels, which often suffer from unstable and suboptimal per-\nformance due to their reliance on random or manually se-\nlected examples. To overcome these limitations, we propose\nCAMS, a novel framework inspired by the pedagogical prin-\nciple of \u201ctailored teaching with balanced dif\ufb01culty\u201d. CAMS\nintegrates two key dimensions \u2014 model-perceived dif\ufb01culty\nand sample complexity \u2014 to construct a customized prompt\ncurriculum that balances between easy and challenging ex-\namples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CAMS through\nexperiments on \ufb01ve benchmarks using multiple state-of-\ntheart multimodal large language models. We also highlight\npromising directions for future work, including adapting\nCAMS to broader multimodal settings and further exploring\ndataset feature dimensions for deeper curriculum design.\nReferences\nAngluin, D. 1988.

Introduction\nThe recent evolution of large language models (LLMs) has\nbeen driven by empirical scaling laws (Hestness et al., 2017)\nthat link training loss to model size, dataset size, and com-\npute budget. Kaplan et al. showed that these laws hold\nacross seven orders of magnitude, establishing them as a\nreliable extrapolation tool for dense Transformers (Kaplan\net al., 2020). Subsequent work by Hoffmann et al. demon-\nstrated that scaling curves can be inverted to choose the\ncompute-optimal combination of parameters and tokens for\na fixed budget (Hoffmann et al., 2022). Together, these\nresults have made scaling analysis a cornerstone of model\nplanning at both academic and industrial labs.\nYet the coefficients of the scaling laws are not universal.\nHighly expressive models trained under different optimiz-\ners or architectures often follow the same loss trajectory\nbut diverge substantially on downstream reasoning bench-\nmarks (Liu et al., 2023). Brandfonbrener et al. extend\nthe classic laws with loss-to-loss prediction, showing that\nthe mapping between training and test distributions admits\nits own power law when the distributions differ substan-\ntially (Brandfonbrener et al., 2025). These observations\nimply that optimal budgets must be re-estimated whenever\nwe modify the model or the data pipeline.\nA particularly compelling architectural modification is the\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, offering high capacity\nat fixed FLOPs by routing each token through a sparse subset\nof experts (Shazeer et al., 2017; Lepikhin et al., 2021; Fedus\net al., 2021). Modern flagship models, e.g., Gemini 2.5\nPro (Gemini Team, 2025), DeepSeek-V3 (DeepSeek-AI,\n2025b), and Qwen3 (Qwen Team, 2025) now rely on MoE\nas a de-facto standard for economical scaling. Abnar et al.\nderive a parameters-vs-FLOPs frontier and locate an optimal\nsparsity for a given compute budget (Abnar et al., 2025).\nThese findings emphasize that the classical dense-model\nfrontier is an incomplete picture, and one must account for\narchitectural knobs such as MoE sparsity and top-k routing.\nFurthermore, loss-based scaling curves do not always pre-\ndict the performance on downstream tasks. Jelassi et al.\nreport that increasing MoE sparsity improves memorization\nbenchmarks, but saturates for reasoning performance (Je-\nlassi et al., 2025). However, the Mixture of Parrots paper (Je-\n1\narXiv:2508.18672v1  [cs.LG]  26 Aug 2025\n\nOptimal Sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models for Reasoning Tasks\nlassi et al., 2025) only explores the number of active vs. total\nparameters, ignoring the effect of routing strategies beyond\nstandard top-2 routing. They also do not consider the effect\nof reinforcement learning and test-time compute on their\nreasoning benchmarks. Evaluating reasoning performance\nimmediately after pre-training overlooks both the benefits of\npost-training adaptation and the leverage of additional test-\ntime compute. Post-training methods such as GRPO, which\nuse reinforcement signals to encourage coherent chain-of-\nthought generation, sharpen a model\u2019s reasoning on complex\ntasks (OpenAI, 2024b; DeepSeek-AI, 2025a). Beyond these\nrefinements, models can further improve outputs at test\ntime by adopting calibrated decoding strategies that mirror\nhow humans pause to reconsider difficult problems. These\ntest-time approaches not only boost routine benchmark per-\nformance but, when properly tuned, substantially enhance\nmulti-step mathematical reasoning, demonstrating that adap-\ntive computing at test time is a powerful complement to both\nmodel scale and post-training adaptation.\nIn this paper, we aim to identify how the optimal sparsity\nof MoE changes between memorization (TriviaQA, Hel-\nlaSwag) and reasoning (GSM8K, GSM-Plus) tasks. In this\nwork, we use the term dense models to refer to standard\nTransformers with a single feed-forward network per layer.\nFor MoE models, we define sparsity as sparsity = 1\u2212Top-k\nExperts\nfollowing the convention that sparsity measures the fraction\nof inactive parameters. We train families of MoEs varying\nnot only the total vs. active parameters, but also the num-\nber of top-k experts. For each model, we measure the loss\non the pre-training data, the task loss on the downstream\nbenchmarks, and the accuracy on those benchmarks. This\nallows us to disentangle the generalization gap between the\ntrain vs. test loss, and the gap between loss vs. accuracy.\nFor both memorization and reasoning benchmarks, the train\nloss decreases monotonically with the total parameters. The\ntask loss and accuracy follow the same monotonic trend as\nthe train loss for memorization benchmarks. In contrast, for\nreasoning benchmarks, the task loss and accuracy diverge\nfrom the monotonic trend as the total parameters increase\nand training loss decreases. We found that changing the k in\ntop-k routing itself has a negligible effect if the number of\nactive parameters is kept constant. We also consider classic\ngeneralization-gap controls by sweeping the learning rate\nand initialization, and show that their effects align strikingly\nwith the generalization-gap caused by sparsity. This con-\nfirms that the gap between the performance on memorization\nvs. reasoning tasks can be induced not only by sparsity of\nthe MoE, but also classical hyperparameters like learning\nrate and initialization. We further investigate whether ap-\nplying GRPO or additional test-time compute could recover\nthe poor reasoning ability of sparser models. Our results\nshow that the gap between memorization and reasoning per-\nformance caused by increased sparsity remains unchanged\neven after GRPO and increased test-time compute. This\nmeans that finding the optimal sparsity of the MoE during\npre-training is crucial for training a reasoning model under a\nfixed compute budget. We release model checkpoints, code\nand logs are open-source at https://github.com/\nrioyokotalab/optimal-sparsity.\n2. Background and Related Work\n2.1. Mixture of Experts\nMoE Architecture.\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) networks\nwere introduced by (Jacobs et al., 1991; Jordan & Jacobs,\n1994) and later brought to large-scale neural language mod-\neling by Shazeer et al. (2017). Within the Transformer\narchitecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), MoE layers have proven\nespecially effective, scaling to hundreds of billions of param-\neters while maintaining manageable training costs (Lepikhin\net al., 2021; Fedus et al., 2021; Du et al., 2022; Zoph et al.,\n2022).\nConsequently, modern state-of-the-art language\nmodels, including Gemini 2.5 Pro (Gemini Team, 2025),\nDeepSeek-V3 (DeepSeek-AI, 2025b), and Qwen3 (Qwen\nTeam, 2025), rely heavily on MoE layers to achieve supe-\nrior performance under fixed inference budgets. In an MoE\nlayer, a learnable router assigns each token to a sparse sub-\nset of experts. Let x \u2208Rdh be a token representation and\n{FFN(x)i}n\ni=1 the n feed-forward experts. For top-k rout-\ning, the router produces scores s = x\u22a4Wrouter \u2208Rn, and\nselects the indices K of the k largest components, then\nnormalizes them: g(x)i =\nexp(si)\nP\nj\u2208K exp(sj) if i \u2208K and\ng(x)i = 0 otherwise.\nThe layer output is the weighted sum of the chosen experts:\ny = Pn\ni=1g(x)i FFN(x)i. Modern MoE models typically\nsupplement the token-level cross-entropy loss with two aux-\niliary terms: a load-balancing loss LLB, which prevents ex-\npert collapse (Shazeer et al., 2017), and a router-z loss LRZ,\nwhich penalizes large router logits for better numerical sta-\nbility and gradient flow (Zoph et al., 2022). The combined\ntraining loss is expressed as L = LCE + \u03b1LLB + \u03b2LRZ,\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are hyperparameters that control the relative\nimportance of each term in the objective function. This\nformulation is widely used in recent MoE-based language\nmodels and remains unchanged throughout the experiments.\n2.2. Scaling Laws of LLMs\nScaling Laws for MoE.\nExisting scaling laws demon-\nstrate power-law relationships between model performance,\nparameter count, dataset size, and compute budget (Ka-\nplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022). Scaling laws for\nMoE models have similarly explored how total parameter\ncount and expert granularity jointly affect scaling behavior\n(Clark et al., 2022; Ludziejewski et al., 2024). Building\non this, Frantar et al. derived sparsity-aware scaling expo-\n2\n\nOptimal Sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models for Reasoning Tasks\nnents that bridge dense and sparse regimes (Frantar et al.,\n2024), while Abnar et al. empirically charted the optimal\ntrade-offs between total parameters and FLOPs per token\nin MoE settings (Abnar et al., 2025). Complementary theo-\nretical and empirical work shows that adding experts tends\nto improve memorization more than reasoning, motivating\nnew, generalized scaling frameworks that address scaling\nlaws for reasoning performance (Jelassi et al., 2025). Fur-\nthermore, recent analyses indicate that increasing sparsity\nitself can directly improve loss, highlighting sparsity as a\nkey dimension in scaling behavior (Team, 2025).\nTask Loss.\nSince the scaling law for next-token predic-\ntion loss does not necessarily align with downstream task\nloss, it may not be reliable for predicting benchmark per-\nformance (Grattafiori et al., 2024). Some work has tried to\nmodel downstream accuracy with an exponential curve, but\naccuracy is only predictable when we average over many\ntasks and carefully choose which ones to include (Gadre\net al., 2024). Another line of research instead first quanti-\nfies how downstream task loss scales with parameters and\ndata, then converts predicted losses into accuracy estimates,\nachieving under two points of absolute error for mid-scale\nmodels using minimal extra compute (Bhagia et al., 2024).\nPrior work observes that downstream task loss relates to\npre-training loss, where the shifts depend on the minimal\nachievable losses determined by the intrinsic complexity\nand distributional mismatch between the pre-training and\ndownstream datasets (Brandfonbrener et al., 2025). Because\nscaling laws differ across tasks, the optimal scaling strategy\nmay also vary; for example, knowledge-based QA tasks are\n\u201ccapacity-hungry,\u201d benefiting more from larger model sizes,\nwhereas code-related tasks are \u201cdata-hungry,\u201d benefiting\nmore from increased training data (Roberts et al., 2025).\nInverse Scaling.\nStandard scaling laws imply that one\ncan indefinitely increase model and dataset size without\nworrying about overfitting; however, if we need to worry\nabout generalization and overfitting, these scaling laws\nbreak down (Caballero et al., 2023). Through the Inverse\nScaling Prize, Wei et al. and McKenzie et al. systematically\nidentified tasks where larger models perform worse (Wei\net al., 2023; McKenzie et al., 2023). More recently, Lourie\net al argue that scaling laws are unreliable predictors of\ndownstream task performance, framing inverse scaling as\na practical constraint on model development (Lourie et al.,\n2025).\n2.3. Post Training and Test-Time Compute (TTC)\nReinforcement Learning (RL) post-training has long been\na predominant approach for improving LLMs. Proximal\nPolicy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017) forms\nthe backbone of RLHF pipelines, from the original GPT\nalignment work (Ouyang et al., 2022) to the GPT-4 family\nof models (OpenAI, 2024a). More recently, Group Rela-\ntive Policy Optimization (GRPO) was introduced as a vari-\nant of PPO that replaces the value function baseline with\na group-relative advantage estimator, thereby improving\nmemory efficiency and stabilizing updates; this approach\nalready powers frontier-scale systems such as DeepSeek-R1,\nachieving state-of-the-art results on mathematical-reasoning\nbenchmarks (Shao et al., 2024; DeepSeek-AI, 2025a).\nComplementary to these training-time advances, scaling\ntest-time compute (TTC) offers an orthogonal approach.\nTTC denotes accuracy gains obtained without updating\nmodel parameters, simply by allocating more inference re-\nsources, e.g., running longer chains of thought (OpenAI,\n2024b; Muennighoff et al., 2025b), sampling larger can-\ndidate pools (Li et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023; Brown\net al., 2024; Schaeffer et al., 2025), or performing explicit\nsearch-and-verify steps (Lightman et al., 2024; Shinn et al.,\n2024; Snell et al., 2025; Inoue et al., 2025). Among these,\nself-consistency, repeated sampling with majority-vote ag-\ngregation, has emerged as a strong TTC baseline (Wang\net al., 2023).\n3. Experiments\nIn this section, we empirically demonstrate the scaling of\ndownstream task performance through a systematic inves-\ntigation of memorization-reasoning benchmarks in MoE\nLLMs.\n3.1. Experimental Setup\nWe use the Mixtral (Jiang et al., 2024) architecture, a\nTransformer backbone with RMSNorm (Zhang & Sennrich,\n2019), SwiGLU activations (Shazeer, 2020), and rotary po-\nsitional embeddings (Su et al., 2024). Each feed-forward\nblock is a sparsely gated MoE layer, gated by the drop-\nless token-choice top-k routing (Gale et al., 2023). All\nmodels use L = 16 layers, following Muennighoff et al.\n(2025a). We sweep three architectural hyperparameters:\n(i) the model width d \u2208{512, 1024, 2048}; (ii) the num-\nber of experts per layer E \u2208{8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256}; and\n(iii) the top-k experts per token k \u2208{2, 4, 8, 16}. Each\nfeed-forward network has a hidden dimension of 2d. When\nd = 512 and d = 1024, we train every combination of E\nand k. For d = 2048, we limit the search to E \u2264128 due\nto computational resource constraints.\nWe train with AdamW (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019) using\na peak learning rate of 4 \u00d7 10\u22124, a 2k-step linear warm-\nup followed by cosine decay, and a weight decay of 0.1.\nFollowing Xue et al. (2024) and Zoph et al. (2022), we use\nthe load-balancing and router z-losses by 10\u22122 and 10\u22123,\nrespectively.\n3\n\nOptimal Sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models for Reasoning Tasks\nHyperparameter Study.\nTo isolate optimization effects,\nwe reuse the same 125 B-token corpus. For all HP runs,\nwe fix E = 16, k = 2, and train two widths, dmodel \u2208\n{512, 1024}, with the same FFN expansion factor 2. We\nvary (i) LM-head initialization schemes, (ii) peak learning\nrate, and (iii) AdamW \u03f5. Further implementation and envi-\nronmental details are deferred to Appendix A.3.\nPre-training Datasets.\nWe use a balanced mixture of\ngeneral-domain and mathematics-centric corpora, totaling\n125 B-tokens. High quality web text (43 B) comes from de-\nduplicated DCLM (Zyphra, 2024), the Flan-decontaminated\nDolmino subset, and WebInstructFull. Mathematics (32 B)\ncombines OLMo OpenWebMath and Algebraic-Stack (Sol-\ndaini et al., 2024), FineMath-4+ (Liu et al., 2024a), the Math-\nPile commercial subset (Wang et al., 2024), the math split\nof Dolmino-Mix-1124 (OLMo, 2025), OpenMathInstruct-\n1/2 (Toshniwal et al., 2024b;a), StackMathQA, Orca-\nMath (Mitra et al., 2024), and GSM8K train (Cobbe et al.,\n2021). STEM Literature & Reference (42 B) consists of\narXiv, pes2o, Wikipedia, and Dolma\u2013books (Soldaini et al.,\n2024). Finally, we add Code from the StackExchange code\nsubset. See Appendix A.1 for complete statistics.\nEvaluation Protocol.\nWe evaluate three capability areas\nwith standard few-shot prompts. Mathematical Reasoning:\nGSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) (4-shot) and GSM-Plus (Li\net al., 2024) (5-shot CoT). Reading Comprehension: Trivi-\naQA (Joshi et al., 2017) with 4-shot prompting. Common-\nsense Reasoning: HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), each\nunder a 4-shot prompting setup. See Appendix 3 for further\ndetails.\n3.2. Downstream Performance Does Not Necessarily\nImprove with Total Parameter Size\nIn this section, we examine how the expert sparsity in MoE\nmodels affects the relationship between pre-training loss and\ndownstream performance. We train a series of models with\ncontrolled sparsity levels and measure their performance on\nthe representative downstream tasks. Our analysis shows\nthat while increasing the total number of parameters reduces\npre-training loss, downstream task loss on mathematical\nreasoning worsens beyond a certain model size.\nTask Loss Computation.\nFollowing Brandfonbrener et al.\n(2025) and Grattafiori et al. (2024), we compute cross-\nentropy only over the answer tokens by concatenating the\nprompt with the ground-truth answer. For multiple-choice\ndatasets (e.g., HellaSwag, TriviaQA) the target sequence\nis the correct answer string, as in Bhagia et al. (2024).\nFor open-ended mathematics datasets such as GSM8K,\nand GSM-Plus we likewise compute cross-entropy directly\nagainst the ground-truth answer tokens.\nTraining Loss and Validation Loss.\nFigure 1 presents the\ntraining and validation losses when fixing the top-k/MoE\nlayer width constant and increasing only the number of ex-\nperts (and hence the total parameter count). As the total\nparameter count grows, both training and validation losses\ndecrease. Therefore, in terms of pre-training loss, increas-\ning total parameters (thereby raising sparsity) reduces pre-\ntraining loss, which is consistent with prior work.\nExperiments with Task Loss\nNext, we examine how\nthe downstream task loss responds to increases in the to-\ntal parameter count. Figure 2 shows task loss on several\nbenchmarks as we vary only the number of experts, hold-\ning both top-k and each MoE layer widths constant. On\nTriviaQA and HellaSwag, lower pre-training loss reduces\ntask loss, indicating that larger total parameter models yield\nbetter results on these datasets. In contrast, for GSM8K and\nGSM-Plus, further reductions in pre-training loss do not\ntranslate into improved task loss; in some cases, the task\nloss actually worsens. These results suggest that, once top-k\nand layer width are fixed, an optimal number of experts\nexists for each task, and adding more beyond that point can\nharm performance on GSM8K and GSM-Plus.\nDependence on Active Parameter.\nCan we avoid a de-\ncline in performance as the total number of experts in-\ncreases? Figure 2 shows that models with more active pa-\nrameters begin to overfit at a lower pre-training loss and\nreach a lower minimum task loss at their optimal expert\ncounts. Consequently, improving results on GSM8K and\nGSM-Plus requires tuning not only the total number of ex-\nperts but also the top-k size. Whether a similar trend occurs\non other reasoning benchmarks, including code-generation\ntasks, remains an open question.\nDownstream Accuracy.\nThe decline in math-task perfor-\nmance as total parameters increase is not limited to task loss;\nit also consistently holds for downstream accuracy (Figure\n3). For TriviaQA and HellaSwag, accuracy improves mono-\ntonically as training loss decreases. By contrast, on GSM8K,\nfurther reductions in pre-training loss do not always translate\nto higher accuracy. When the number of active parameters\nis held constant, over-optimizing pre-training loss can in-\ndeed harm performance. Figure 4 plots benchmark error rate\nagainst pre-training loss, including intermediate checkpoints.\nWe observe a sparsity dependence for reasoning-oriented\ntasks such as GSM8K and GSM-Plus. These results suggest\nthat, for MoE models, downstream accuracy can deviate\nfrom the predictions of conventional scaling laws, and these\ndeviations may vary across different tasks.\n4\n\nOptimal Sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models for Reasoning Tasks\n100\n101\nTotal parameters (B)\n1.6\n1.7\n1.8\n1.9\n2.0\n2.1\nFinal loss\nTrain Loss\n100\n101\nTotal parameters (B)\n1.7\n1.8\n1.9\n2.0\n2.1\n2.2\n2.3\nValidation Loss\n100\n101\nTotal parameters (B)\n3.6\n3.8\n4.0\n4.2\n4.4\n4.6\nTask loss\nHellaSwag\n100\n101\nTotal parameters (B)\n1.0\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\n1.4\nGSM8K\nd= 512,k=2\nd= 512,k=4\nd= 512,k=8\nd= 512,k=16\nd=1024,k=2\nd=1024,k=4\nd=1024,k=8\nd=1024,k=16\nd=2048,k=2\nd=2048,k=4\nd=2048,k=8\nd=2048,k=16\nFigure 1. Although training and validation loss decrease as the total number of parameters grows, the task loss on GSM8K can\nsometimes worsen with larger models. Training and validation losses steadily decrease as total or active parameters increase. The\nHellaSwag task loss follows this scaling trend, whereas GSM8K task loss worsens once total parameters exceed a threshold.\n1.6\n1.8\n2.0\nFinal training loss\n8\n9\n10\nTask loss\nconstantly decrease\nTriviaQA\n1.6\n1.8\n2.0\nFinal training loss\n3.6\n3.8\n4.0\n4.2\n4.4\n4.6\nHellaSwag\n1.6\n1.8\n2.0\nFinal training loss\n1.0\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\n1.4\nbegin to increase\nGSM8K\n1.6\n1.8\n2.0\nFinal training loss\n1.6\n1.7\n1.8\n1.9\n2.0\nGSM-Plus\nd=512, k=2, A=170M\nd=512, k=4, A=220M\nd=512, k=8, A=320M\nd=512, k=16, A=520M\nd=1024, k=2, A=470M\nd=1024, k=4, A=670M\nd=1024, k=8, A=1.1B\nd=1024, k=16, A=1.9B\nd=2048, k=2, A=1.5B\nd=2048, k=4, A=2.3B\nd=2048, k=8, A=3.9B\nd=2048, k=16, A=7.1B\nFigure 2. For GSM8K and GSM-Plus, once the training loss drops below a certain point, the task loss starts to increase. Results of\nscaling total parameters by increasing the number of experts, with model width and top-k held constant. For TriviaQA and HellaSwag,\nthe task loss falls monotonically as training loss decreases. By contrast, GSM8K and GSM-Plus show a U-shaped trend: task loss\ndeclines with training loss only until a threshold, beyond which further reductions in training loss hurt task performance. That threshold\nmoves lower as active parameter count increases, models with more active parameters achieve a lower optimal task loss. No such active\nparameters dependence appears for TriviaQA, HellaSwag.\n3.3. Optimal Sparsity for Iso-FLOP Budgets\nWe next analyze model quality under a constant compute\nbudget, that is, along IsoFLOP contours (Hoffmann et al.,\n2022; Abnar et al., 2025). For a fixed per-token FLOP\ncount, we vary only the sparsity configuration: the number\nof experts E and the top-k value, while holding the hidden\ndimension and sequence length.\nIn Figure 5, we plot the task-specific optimal sparsity (i.e. 1-\nTopK/Experts) against model performance under a fixed\nFLOPs budget. For QA benchmarks such as TriviaQA\nand HellaSwag, lower density (higher sparsity) consistently\nyields lower task loss and higher accuracy. This pattern\naligns with prior studies showing that, when FLOPs are\nfixed to be constant, sparse models outperform denser mod-\nels on QA tasks (Abnar et al., 2025).\nBy contrast, on\nmathematical-reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K and\nGSM-Plus, denser models outperform their sparser counter-\nparts. At lower FLOPs, increasing sparsity still reduces loss\nand improves accuracy; however, once the FLOPs budget\ngrows, denser models begin to perform better, achieving\nboth lower loss and higher accuracy. This shift indicates\nthat the optimal model density for reasoning tasks depends\non compute budget: when a lot of FLOPs are available,\ndenser models may be preferable.\n3.4. Tokens per parameter\nThe Chinchilla scaling law (Hoffmann et al., 2022) estab-\nlishes that, under a fixed compute budget, the optimal trade-\noff between model parameters and training tokens corre-\nsponds to approximately 20 tokens per parameter (TPP)\nfor dense models. More recently, Roberts et al. (2025)\nrefined this view by showing that the optimal TPP ratio\nis task-dependent: knowledge-based QA tasks, which are\n5\n\nOptimal Sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models for Reasoning Tasks\n1.6\n1.8\n2.0\nFinal training loss\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\nAccuracy\nTriviaQA\n1.6\n1.8\n2.0\nFinal training loss\n0.30\n0.35\n0.40\n0.45\n0.50\nHellaSwag\n1.6\n1.8\n2.0\nFinal training loss\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\nGSM8K\nd= 512,k=2\nd= 512,k=4\nd= 512,k=8\nd= 512,k=16\nd=1024,k=2\nd=1024,k=4\nd=1024,k=8\nd=1024,k=16\nd=2048,k=2\nd=2048,k=4\nd=2048,k=8\nd=2048,k=16\nFigure 3.

Effect of sparsity on performance across different tasks We vary sparsity (1 - top-k/Experts) and plot the relationship between\npre-training loss and benchmark error rate, including intermediate checkpoints. For TriviaQA and HellaSwag, the error rate clearly tracks\ntraining loss and is largely insensitive to sparsity. In contrast, reasoning-intensive tasks such as GSM8K and GSM-Plus exhibit a strong\ndependence of error rate on sparsity.\ncloser to memorization, benefit from lower TPP (i.e., more\nparameters), whereas reasoning-heavy tasks such as code\ngeneration benefit from higher TPP (i.e., more data). These\nfindings highlight that TPP should be interpreted not as a\nuniversal constant, but as a task-sensitive scaling variable.\nIn our study, although we varied the number of experts while\nkeeping the total FLOPs fixed, this implicitly altered the\nTPP measured with respect to total parameters. As shown in\nFigure 7, this variation reveals distinct behaviors across task\ncategories. For memorization-oriented tasks such as Trivi-\naQA and HellaSwag, performance improves monotonically\nas TPP decreases, consistent with the \u201cparameter-hungry\u201d\ncharacterization reported by Roberts et al. (2025). For rea-\nsoning tasks such as GSM8K and GSM-Plus, we observe a\nnon-monotonic trend: accuracy peaks near TPP \u224820 and\nthen declines, suggesting that excessively low TPP (i.e.,\ntoo many parameters relative to tokens) can hurt reasoning\nperformance.\nFurthermore, our experiments reveal that active compute op-\nerationalized through the number of top-k experts interacts\nstrongly with TPP. Even at fixed TPP, models with larger\ntop-k values consistently outperform those with smaller top-\nk on reasoning tasks. This indicates that, in MoE models,\nreasoning ability depends not only on the Total TPP but also\non the balance between total and active parameters. In other\nwords, the discussion of compute-optimal scaling in MoE\narchitectures must explicitly consider both total parameter\ncount and the number of activated parameters per token.\n3.5. Impact of TTC and Post-Training on Downstream\nPerformance\nTest-Time Compute and RL post-training are standard for\nboosting reasoning on tasks such as mathematical problem\nsolving. We therefore investigated whether performance de-\nclines reported above persist when applying (a) Test-Time\nCompute (TTC) and (b) RL post-training (GRPO). In Test-\nTime Compute, we evaluated GSM8K(COBBE ET AL.,\n2021) in a purely zero-shot setting using Self-Consistency\n(SC) decoding(Wang et al., 2023), generating 27 indepen-\ndent continuations per problem and selecting the most fre-\nquent answer. In Post-Training, we fine-tuned each model\non the GSM8K training dataset using the GRPO algorithm\n(Shao et al., 2024). We followed the settings of Zhao et al.\n(2025) including reward function and fixed the learning rate\nconstant across all model configurations.\nAs illustrated in Figure 6, neither Test-Time Compute nor\n6\n\nOptimal Sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models for Reasoning Tasks\n1\n1/2\n1/4\n1/8\n1/16\n1/32\n1/64\n1/128\nMoE Density (k/E)\n7.5\n8.0\n8.5\n9.0\n9.5\n10.0\n10.5\nTask loss\nTriviaQA\n1\n1/2\n1/4\n1/8\n1/16\n1/32\n1/64\n1/128\nMoE Density\n3.6\n3.8\n4.0\n4.2\n4.4\n4.6\nHellaSwag\n1\n1/2\n1/4\n1/8\n1/16\n1/32\n1/64\n1/128\nMoE Density\n1.0\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\n1.4\nGSM8K\n1\n1/2\n1/4\n1/8\n1/16\n1/32\n1/64\n1/128\nMoE Density\n1.6\n1.7\n1.8\n1.9\n2.0\nGSM Plus\n27\n28\n29\n210\n211\n212\nActive Params (millions)\n1\n1/2\n1/4\n1/8\n1/16\n1/32\n1/64\n1/128\nMoE Density (k/E)\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\nAccuracy\nTriviaQA\n1\n1/2\n1/4\n1/8\n1/16\n1/32\n1/64\n1/128\nMoE Density\n0.30\n0.35\n0.40\n0.45\n0.50\nHellaSwag\n1\n1/2\n1/4\n1/8\n1/16\n1/32\n1/64\n1/128\nMoE Density\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\nGSM8K\n1\n1/2\n1/4\n1/8\n1/16\n1/32\n1/64\n1/128\nMoE Density\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\nGSM-Plus\n27\n28\n29\n210\n211\n212\nActive Params (millions)\nFigure 5.

Task loss (top row) and Accuracy (bottom\nrow) against MoE Density k/E for a fixed active parameter budget.In the left two tasks (TriviaQA, HellaSwag), increasing sparsity\nconsistently lowers task loss and raises accuracy across all active parameter budgets, in contrast, in the right two tasks (GSM8K, GSM-\nPlus), once active parameter counts become large, this trend reverses and denser models begin to outperform their sparser counterparts.\nDashed segments mark the inverse-scaling regime that starts at the black circle; solid segments show the standard scaling region to the\nright.\n1.7\n1.8\n1.9\nFinal training loss\n0.30\n0.35\n0.40\n0.45\n0.50\nAccuracy (SC)\nGSM8K (TTC)\n1.70\n1.75\n1.80\n1.85\n1.90\nFinal training loss\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\nAccuracy\nGSM8K (GRPO)\nd=1024,k=2\nbefore GRPO\nd=1024,k=4\nafter GRPO\nd=1024,k=8\nd=1024,k=16\nFigure 6.

Left: Final training loss vs accu-\nracy under Test-Time Compute (Self-Consistency). Right: Final\ntraining loss vs accuracy after GRPO post-training.\nGRPO mitigates the GSM8K performance drop that arises\nwhen total parameters increase. In other words, although\nboth methods consistently improve overall performance,\nthey do not eliminate the inverted U-shaped relationship\nbetween training loss and task accuracy.\n3.6. Influence of Optimization Hyperparameter\nThus far, we have demonstrated that the structure of the\nmodel, particularly the degree of sparsity, can lead to dif-\nferences in reasoning performance on downstream tasks,\neven when the models converge to the same training loss.\nSuch differences are similar to generalization, in which a\nmodel\u2019s behavior on unseen data reflects implicit inductive\nbiases rather than mere fit to the training data. Studies on\nneural network generalization have long recognized that not\nonly architectural choices, but also optimization dynamics\n(i.e., differences in hyperparameter settings, regularization\nschemes, and optimizer algorithms), play an important role\nin shaping these inductive biases. Motivated by this insight,\nwe examine the learning-rate scale, which is critical to gen-\neralization (Keskar et al., 2017; Li et al., 2019; Yang & Hu,\n2021). Our goal is to investigate how these choices influence\nthe model\u2019s ability to transfer to downstream tasks, beyond\nwhat is captured by pre-training loss alone.\nFigure 8 illustrates our empirical findings, obtained us-\ning a MoE architecture with 16 experts. By varying the\nlearning rate, we evaluate performance on both QA bench-\nmarks (TriviaQA, HellaSwag) and reasoning benchmarks\n7\n\n\n\nOptimal Sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models for Reasoning Tasks\n101\n102\nTPP\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\nAccuracy\nTriviaQA\n101\n102\nTPP\n0.30\n0.35\n0.40\n0.45\n0.50\nHellaSwag\n101\n102\nTPP\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\nGSM8K\n101\n102\nTPP\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\nGSM-Plus\nd=512, k=2\nd=512, k=4\nd=512, k=8\nd=512, k=16\nd=1024, k=2\nd=1024, k=4\nd=1024, k=8\nd=1024, k=16\nd=2048, k=2\nd=2048, k=4\nd=2048, k=8\nd=2048, k=16\nFigure 7. Effect of TPP on performance across different tasks. For TriviaQA and HellaSwag, performance improves as the number\nof parameters increases. In contrast, for reasoning-intensive tasks such as GSM8K and GSM-Plus, performance deteriorates when the\nnumber of parameters becomes too large, indicating that there exists an optimal data to total parameter ratio for these tasks. Even at fixed\nTPP, models with larger top-k values consistently outperform those with smaller top-k on reasoning tasks.\n1.9\n2.1\n2.3\n2.5\nTraining loss\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\nAccuracy\nTriviaQA\n1.9\n2.1\n2.3\n2.5\nTraining loss\n0.26\n0.28\n0.30\n0.32\n0.34\n0.36\n0.38\n0.40\nHellaSwag\n1.9\n2.1\n2.3\n2.5\nTraining loss\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\nGSM8K\n1.9\n2.1\n2.3\n2.5\nTraining loss\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\nGSM-Plus\n1.9\n2.1\n2.3\n2.5\nTraining loss\n10\n1\n100\n101\n102\n103\n104\nCurvature Max Eigen\nMax Eigen (Linear Layer)\nLR = 6.4e-3\nLR = 3.2e-3\nLR = 1.6e-3\nLR = 8e-4\nLR = 4e-4\nLR = 2e-4\nFigure 8. For reasoning tasks like GSM8K and GSM-Plus, the relationship between training loss and downstream performance is\ndependent on the choice of optimization hyperparameters. The learning rate also impacts downstream accuracy. For the maximum\neigenvalue, we evaluated the maximum eigenvalue of fisher information matrix under a K-FAC approximation (Martens & Grosse, 2015;\nEschenhagen et al., 2023). Following (Grosse et al., 2023), we calculate the maximum eigenvalues only for linear layers. We find that\nhigher learning rates lead to a lower maximum eigenvalue, which is consistent with existing research indicating that convergence to flatter\nminima improves generalization (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997; Keskar et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2020).\n(GSM8K, GSM-Plus). While QA benchmark performance\nlike TriviaQA and HellaSwag remains largely invariant to\nthese hyperparameters, reasoning benchmark performance\nlike GSM8K and GSM-Plus are sensitive to the learning\nrates: when models converge to the same training loss, train-\nings with lower learning rates and smaller initialization\nscales yield superior downstream accuracy. These obser-\nvations carry an important implication. Studies on gener-\nalization in large-scale language models should incorpo-\nrate rigorous reasoning benchmarks (such as GSM8K and\nGSM-Plus) rather than relying solely on validation loss\ncurves or standard QA tasks to fully capture the impact of\noptimization-induced implicit biases. This enables a more\nprecise analysis on the generalization of LLMs.\n3.7. Ablation on Depth\nWe conducted additional experiments using a 32 layer archi-\ntecture. Motivated by prior reports suggesting that increased\ndepth can improve performance (Liu et al., 2024b; Team,\n2024; Ye et al., 2025), we evaluated whether deeper models\nexhibit similar trends in our setting. For the 32 layer config-\nuration, we observed that the results align with the patterns\ndiscussed in the previous section, when analyzed through\nthe lens of TPP, the behavior remains consistent with our\nearlier findings.\n3.8. Coding Task Ablations\nWe evaluate whether the sparsity performance trade offs ob-\nserved for mathematical reasoning transfer to code genera-\ntion. Unless otherwise noted, we reuse the same architecture\nand optimization hyperparameters as in the experimental\nsetup.

Effect of model depth on TPP-performance trade-offs.\ndetails.\nFigure 10 summarizes performance as a function of MoE\ndensity k/E under matched active compute budgets. As\nactive parameters grow, both HumanEval and MBPP exhibit\na clear shift in their optima toward denser configurations:\nbeyond a task-dependent threshold, further increasing spar-\nsity degrades pass@1 despite continued improvements in\npre-training loss. This echoes our math findings: when com-\npute allows large active capacity, denser MoE layers yield\nbetter procedural reasoning for code synthesis, whereas\nsparser layers are more favorable only in the low-compute\nregime. Detailed results for the coding tasks are provided in\nAppendix C.5.\n4. Discussion and Limitations\nDataset\nAll models are trained on a 125B-token corpus.\nThis corpus is Chinchilla-optimal for dense models of com-\nparable activated size (Hoffmann et al., 2022), yet two orders\nof magnitude smaller than the multi-trillion-token budgets\nnow common for state-of-the-art MoE LLMs (DeepSeek-AI,\n2025b; Qwen Team, 2025). Recent large models such as\nOLMo-2 and Qwen-3 adopt a multi-stage curriculum train-\ning, general web pre-training followed by mid-training on\nmath and CoT data (OLMo, 2025; Qwen Team, 2025); we\navoid this design to keep a fixed data distribution and a clean\nlink between pre-train loss and downstream accuracy, but\nexploring staged curricula remains important future work.\nThese caveats render our conclusions suggestive rather than\nprescriptive and motivate verification at trillion-token scale\nwith richer reasoning corpora.\nModel\nWe build on the Mixtral backbone and adopt the\nfine-grained expert segmentation of DeepSeek-MoE: each\nfeed-forward block is split into g = 2, so the effective\nexpert count becomes E \u00d7 g while the total parameter bud-\nget stays fixed. In conjunction with standard top-k routing\nstrategy (k \u2208{2, 4, 8, 16}) and the auxiliary importance /\nload-balance loss of Shazeer et al. (2017), our hyperparam-\neter sweep evaluates configurations with up to 256 active\nexperts. This is contrast to contemporary MoE variants\nsuch as Qwen-3, which primarily differ from Mixtral by the\nintegration of only QK-Norm and a global load-balancing\nregularizer. These modifications are negligible in compar-\nison to the scale of changes evaluated in our experiments.\nFor scaling, the number of experts is more influential than\nminor structural details. We explore configurations with up\nto 256 experts and a top-16 routing strategy, which offers\na sufficiently broad range for our purposes. We acknowl-\nedge that gating design choices, such as the formulation\nof the load-balance loss, might affect how expert scaling\ninfluences performance; we leave this for future work. The\npatterns we report are intended as provisional observations\nrather than definitive rules. We encourage further studies to\nexamine these effects at larger model scales.\n5. Conclusion\nIn this paper, we investigated the optimal sparsity of MoE\nlanguage models through the lens of downstream task per-\nformance. By training families of Mixtral-style MoEs with\nvarious number of experts, top-k routing, and model width,\nand by evaluating them across pre-training, GRPO post-\ntraining, and test-time compute, we show that the classical\n\u201cmore experts is better\u201d rule holds for knowledge-oriented\nbenchmarks such as TriviaQA and HellaSwag, but not for\nmathematical reasoning benchmarks. On reasoning tasks,\ndownstream task loss starts to rise, and accuracy to fall, once\ntotal parameters grow at a certain point; in this regime, mod-\nels with more active parameters may achieve lower optimal\ntask loss, whereas those with extreme sparsity over-fit de-\nspite lower pre-training loss. Neither reinforcement-learning\npost-training nor additional test-time compute removes this\ntrade-off. These findings update current scaling practice.\nWhen computational budget is fixed, allocating FLOPs to\nextra experts improves memorization, but improving reason-\n9\n\nOptimal Sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models for Reasoning Tasks\n1\n1/2\n1/4\n1/8\n1/16\n1/32\n1/64\n1/128\nMoE Density (k/E)\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\nAccuracy\nTriviaQA\n1\n1/2\n1/4\n1/8\n1/16\n1/32\n1/64\n1/128\nMoE Density\n0.300\n0.325\n0.350\n0.375\n0.400\n0.425\n0.450\nHellaSwag\n1\n1/2\n1/4\n1/8\n1/16\n1/32\n1/64\n1/128\nMoE Density\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\nHumanEval\n1\n1/2\n1/4\n1/8\n1/16\n1/32\n1/64\n1/128\nMoE Density\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\n0.40\nMBPP\n27\n28\n29\n210\n211\n212\nActive Params (millions)\nFigure 10. At fixed active parameter counts, higher sparsity (lower density) consistently improves performance, but at larger active\nparameter counts, HumanEval and MBPP shift their optima back toward dense models. Accuracy against MoE Density k/E for a\nfixed active parameter budget.In the left two tasks (TriviaQA, HellaSwag), increasing sparsity consistently raises accuracy across all\nactive parameter budgets, in contrast, in the right two tasks (HumanEval, MBPP), once active parameter counts become large, this trend\nreverses and denser models begin to outperform their sparser counterparts. Dashed segments mark the inverse-scaling regime that starts at\nthe black circle; solid segments show the standard scaling region to the right.\ning ability requires matching growth in active parameters\nor even shifting toward denser MoE layers once enough\ncompute is available.\nAuthor Contributions\nTaishi Nakamura prepared the pretraining datasets, con-\nducted all pre-training experiments and evaluations (ex-\ncluding test-time-compute), and co-designed the overall\nexperimental setup.

Training Setup\nA.1. Pre-training Dataset Details\nTable 1 details the pre-training corpus: for each subset, it lists the Hugging Face repository, split identifier, and public URL,\nalongside the original size and the number of subsampled tokens we used (125 B tokens in the 99:1 train/validation split,\nas counted by the llm-jp tokenizer v3 with 99,487 tokens). Thus, the total token budget is fixed in strict accordance with\nKaplan\u2019s scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), meaning the observed loss increase (and the accompanying puzzling overfitting\nthat mirrors behavior recently reported by (OLMo, 2025; OpenAI, 2024a)) cannot be attributed to any change in data\nvolume.\nA.2. Post-Training Details\nWe use GRPO(Shao et al., 2024) with a batch size of 1024, train for 15 epochs, and truncate prompts and generated\nsequences to 512 and 1024 tokens respectively. The actor\u2019s learning rate is fixed at 5 \u00d7 10\u22126; the temperature is set to 1.0,\nthe KL-penalty coefficient to 10\u22123, and 5 samples are used per prompt. Optimisation employs Adam with \u03b2 = (0.9, 0.999),\n\u03f5 = 10\u22128, and weight decay of 10\u22122. Following Zhao et al. (2025), we implemented a code-execution-based evaluator\nsupporting TinyGSM-style and OpenMathInstruct-1 outputs. For a width of 2048 with 16 or 64 experts, we swept the\nlearning rate (Fig. 11) and subsequently fixed it to 5 \u00d7 10\u22126 for all GRPO experiments.\n15\n\nOptimal Sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models for Reasoning Tasks\nTable 2.

Implementation & Training Environment\nWe executed all pre-training runs on the ABCI 3.0 supercomputer (Takano et al., 2024), equipped with NVIDIA H200 GPUs\nwith board-level power capped at 500 W per GPU. TTC experiments were conducted on the TSUBAME 4.0 supercomputer\nat the Global Scientific Information and Computing Center, Institute of Science Tokyo. They used NVIDIA H100 SXM5 94\nGB GPUs (four GPUs per node) and InfiniBand NDR200 interconnects for inter-node communication.\nFor pre-training, we extended the Megatron-LM1 codebase to add functionality needed for this study, with support for\npipeline, tensor, and expert parallelism. Reinforcement learning experiments were implemented using GRPO (Shao et al.,\n2024) on top of the VerL2 framework. Model quality was assessed using lm-evaluation-harness3 and LargeLanguageMon-\nkeys4.\nB. Evaluation Setup\nWe evaluate our models using the lm-evaluation-harness framework (Gao et al., 2024) across four key capability areas. All\nevaluations employ standard few-shot prompting strategies unless otherwise specified.\nWe assess logical reasoning capabilities using Mathematical problem-solving is evaluated using GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021)\nwith 4-shot prompting and GSM-Plus (Li et al., 2024) with 5-shot CoT prompting. We evaluate comprehension abilities\nusing TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017) with 4-shot prompting. Common sense reasoning is assessed through HellaSwag (Zellers\n1https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM\n2https://github.com/volcengine/verl\n3https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness\n4https://github.com/ScalingIntelligence/large_language_monkeys\n16\n\nOptimal Sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models for Reasoning Tasks\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nStep\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\nValidation Accuracy\nGSM8K (16 Experts)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nStep\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\nGSM8K (32 Experts)\nlr 1e-6\nlr 2e-6\nlr 5e-6\nlr 1e-5\nlr 2e-5\nlr 5e-5\nFigure 11.

For Test-Time Compute (TTC) experiments specifically, GSM8K evaluation is conducted under a zero-\nshot setting. To accommodate the variety of valid answer formats, we extend the strict match patterns provided by\nthe lm-evaluation-harness beyond the standard implementation. Our matching criteria accept both the standard\nGSM8K format (####) and GSM8K-CoT formats prefixed with \u201cThe answer is\u201d or \u201cAnswer:\u201d.\nTable 3 provides comprehensive details for all evaluation benchmarks.\nC. Additional Experiments\nC.1. GRPO\nTraining on MATH 500 Dataset\nFollowing the analysis presented in Section 3.5, the inverted U-shaped relationship\nbetween training loss and task accuracy persists even after applying GRPO. To verify that this phenomenon is not due to\nperforming GRPO on the GSM8K dataset, we conducted additional GRPO experiments on the MATH 500 dataset (Lightman\net al., 2024). As illustrated in Figure 12, GRPO on the MATH dataset yields consistent results with those obtained on the\nGSM8K dataset, confirming that this inverted U-shaped relationship is robust across different GRPO training datasets.\nC.2. Test-Time Compute\nEvaluation Setup\nWe evaluated both GSM8K(Cobbe et al., 2021) in a purely zero-shot setting using Self-Consistency\n(SC) decoding(Wang et al., 2023), generating 27 independent continuations per problem and selecting the most frequent\nanswer with 128 samples per problem. Specifically, for each prompt we generated up to 1,024 tokens under temperature 0.6\nand nucleus sampling (top-p = 0.95), drawing 128 independent continuations and selecting the most frequent answer.\n17\n\nOptimal Sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models for Reasoning Tasks\n1.70\n1.75\n1.80\n1.85\n1.90\nFinal training loss\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\n0.40\n0.45\nAccuracy\nGRPO on GSM8K\n1.70\n1.75\n1.80\n1.85\n1.90\nFinal training loss\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\nGRPO on MATH 500\nd=1024,k=2\nbefore GRPO\nd=1024,k=4\nafter GRPO\nd=1024,k=8\nd=1024,k=16\nFigure 12. Comparison of GSM8K accuracy for models fine-tuned with GRPO on different training datasets (left: GSM8K, right:\nMATH 500). Performance decline is consistently observed across different training datasets.\nZero-shot VS Few-shot\nTo set up Test Time Compute appropriately, we investigate how varying the number of prompt\nshots affected each expert\u2019s behavior (Figure 13). Few shot performance is unstable and dropped significantly for models\nwith a small number of experts, so we use zero shot inference for Test Time Compute. When few shot chain of thought is\nused to standardize answer formats, the provided demonstration steps can be internalized as a fixed reasoning pattern by the\nmodel. As a result, the model\u2019s inherent inference capabilities may not be fully expressed, and its ability to generalize to\nnovel problems could be hindered (Kojima et al., 2022).\nTemperature\nFigure 14 shows that the inverted U-shaped performance-decline trend holds across every temperature\nsetting, indicating that sampling temperature does not affect this behavior. This suggests that, although temperature controls\ninference randomness, the primary drivers of performance decline are inherent to model architecture rather than temperature\nsettings.\nEvaluation of Larger Generation Budget\nWe extended the sample size used for Test-Time Compute as described in\nSection 3.5, generating a larger set of candidate responses. We then measured the resulting accuracy across different\ngeneration budgets to assess how increased sampling influences performance (Figure 15). For an active parameter count of\n8 (top-8), the performance decline is gradually mitigated, whereas for an active parameter count of 2 (top-2), the decline\nis instead amplified, resulting in a more pronounced U-shaped trend. Although increasing the sample count further may\nprovide additional insights, it remains challenging to identify a consistent mitigation pattern across all models.\nIncreasing Top-k During Inference\nWe compared the performance under TTC for model with a hidden dimension of\n2048, 128 experts, and top-2 routing by varying the inference-time top-k parameter. (Figure 16) Specifically, although\ndoubling top-k sometimes yielded temporary improvements in Pass@1, applying TTC ultimately showed that the original\ntop-2 setting maintained the highest performance, suggesting that no fundamental performance gain occurs.\nC.3. GSM8K Overfitting Analysis\nTo investigate whether our model overfits to GSM8K due to the inclusion of GSM8K training data and its synthetic\nderivatives, we conducted an ablation experiment removing major GSM8K-related datasets from our pre-training corpus as\nlisted in Table 2.\nWe removed TinyGSM-MIND, both GSM8K train split instances, Dolmino SynthMath, OpenMathInstruct-1, and\n18\n\nOptimal Sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models for Reasoning Tasks\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\nGeneration budget\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\nAccuracy\n16 Experts\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\nGeneration budget\n0.175\n0.200\n0.225\n0.250\n0.275\n0.300\n0.325\n0.350\n32 Experts\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\nGeneration budget\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\n0.40\n64 Experts\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\nGeneration budget\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\n0.40\n128 Experts\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\nGeneration budget\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\n256 Experts\n0 shot\n2 shot\n4 shot\n8 shot\nFigure 13.

We observe that the trends with respect to sparsity on GSM8K remain unchanged,\nboth for Pass@1 and TTC metrics. This indicates that while GSM8K training data and its synthetic derivatives do improve\nGSM8K scores, they do not alter the underlying performance trends. However, after post-training, we observe some changes\nin these trends, which we leave as future work to investigate further.\nC.4. GSM8K Problem Analysis\nWe investigated whether models with varying numbers of experts exhibit differences in their ability to solve specific problems\non the GSM8K dataset.\nFigure 19 shows the results. We observe that different sparsity levels solve different instances of the problems.\nC.5. Detailed Results for Coding Tasks\nThis appendix provides detailed results for the coding task ablations, mirroring the analyses for mathematical reasoning\npresented in the main text. Specifically, we detail the non-monotonic relationship between scaling and downstream\nperformance, showing how both task loss (Figure 20, 21) and accuracy (Figure 22) can degrade as pre-training loss\nimproves. We then analyze key architectural factors, including the impact of MoE sparsity (Figure 23) and the optimal\nTokens-per-Parameter (TPP) ratio (Figure 24).\n19\n\nOptimal Sparsity of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models for Reasoning Tasks\n1.75\n1.80\n1.85\n1.90\nFinal Loss\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\nAccuracy\nTop-2\n1.70\n1.75\n1.80\n1.85\n1.90\nFinal Loss\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\nTop-4\n1.70\n1.75\n1.80\n1.85\nFinal Loss\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\nTop-8\n1.65\n1.70\n1.75\n1.80\nFinal Loss\n0.20\n0.25\n0.30\n0.35\n0.40\n0.45\n0.50\nTop-16\nsamples\n1\n2\n4\n8\n16\n32\n64\n128\n256\n512\n1024\nFigure 15.

  "pdfs/2508.18665v1.pdf": "Membership Inference Attacks on LLM-based Recommender\nSystems\nJiajie He1\u2217, Yuechun Gu1\u2020, Min-Chun Chen1\u2021, Keke Chen1\u00a7\n1University of Maryland, Baltimore County\nAbstract\nRecommender systems (RecSys) have become an es-\nsential component of many web applications.\nThe\ncore of the system is a recommendation model trained\non highly sensitive user-item interaction data. While\nprivacy-enhancing techniques are actively studied in\nthe research community, the real-world model devel-\nopment still depends on minimal privacy protection,\ne.g., via controlled access.\nUsers of such systems\nshould have the right to choose not to share highly\nsensitive interactions. However, there is no method\nallowing the user to know which interactions are more\nsensitive than others. Thus, quantifying the privacy\nrisk of RecSys training data is a critical step to en-\nabling privacy-aware RecSys model development and\ndeployment. We propose a membership-inference at-\ntack (MIA)- based privacy scoring method, RecPS,\nto measure privacy risks at both the interaction and\nuser levels. The RecPS interaction-level score defi-\nnition is motivated and derived from differential pri-\nvacy, which is then extended to the user-level scor-\ning method. A critical component is the interaction-\nlevel MIA method RecLiRA, which gives high-quality\nmembership estimation. We have conducted exten-\nsive experiments on well-known benchmark datasets\nand RecSys models to show the unique features and\nbenefits of RecPS scoring in risk assessment and Rec-\nSys model unlearning.\n1\nIntroduction\nRecommendation systems (RecSys) have seen signif-\nicant advances over the past decade and have been\nwidely used in various scenarios such as job matching\n[11], e-commerce [10], and entertainment [18]. How-\never, one critical challenge is still difficult to tackle:\nrecommendation models are naturally task-specific,\n\u2217jiajih1@umbc.edu\n\u2020ygu2@umbc.edu\n\u2021mchen2@umbc.edu\n\u00a7kekechen@umbc.edu\nas they are typically trained with task-specific user-\nitem interactions [30, 44]. Therefore, it is almost im-\npossible to move a recommendation system developed\nfor one domain to another without significant perfor-\nmance degradation. Collecting new training data to\nbuild a new recommendation system has been a well-\naccepted practice. However, it is expensive and time-\nconsuming. Practitioners and researchers have been\nlooking for more efficient approaches to addressing\nthis domain locked-in issue.\nWith the emerging applications of large language\nmodels (LLMs), researchers wonder whether LLMs\ncan be used to gain the highly desired low-cost cross-\ndomain generalization power of RecSys. Earlier ef-\nforts focused on fine-tuning general-purpose LLMs\nfor a specific recommendation domain, including P5\n[19], M6-Rec [14], and TALLRec [3], which often in-\nvolved expensive adjustments.\nMost recent studies\nturned to In-Context Learning (ICL) methods that\nuse cheap zero-shot or few-shots prompts to simplify\nthe customization of LLM for RecSys [25, 30]. These\nmethods have shown comparable or even better rec-\nommendation quality [25, 44] than more expensive\nand sophisticated fine-tuning methods.\nWhile ICL offers substantial advantages through the\npower of prompts, its integration into language mod-\nels raises a critical issue: privacy leakage via prompts\n[39]. It is well known that the success of recommenda-\ntion systems is based on user-interaction data, which\noften contains private information about user prefer-\nences, activities, and social contexts [9, 38, 42, 46].\nIn few-shot ICL RecSys, such data is used by Rec-\nSys to design personalized system prompts. Figure\n1 shows a typical example, where the user\u2019s sensitive\nhistorical interactions marked in red.\nOne of the most fundamental privacy attacks is the\nmembership inference attack (MIA) [5, 22, 27] that\nidentifies whether a record is used in the model train-\ning dataset.\nWhile most MIAs focused on classifi-\ncation modeling, researchers have recently identified\nthe unique features of traditional RecSys models for\nMIAs, such as matrix factorization RecSys [24], feder-\n1\narXiv:2508.18665v1  [cs.IR]  26 Aug 2025\n\nFigure 1: Prompt Example for LLM RecSys\nated RecSys [28], and knowledge-based RecSys [37],\nand designed several RecSys-specific MIA methods\n[23, 41, 42, 46]. However, LLM-based RecSys have\nseveral unique features that the MIA methods de-\nsigned for traditional RecSys models cannot be di-\nrectly applied.\n\u2022 The traditional RecSys MIAs utilize the system\noutput, i.e., the recommended items, to infer\nwhether the core RecSys machine learning model\nhas used the target user\u2019s information in train-\ning. The inference utilizes the similarity between\nthe recommended items and the known victim\nuser\u2019s interacted items, where item embedding,\ni.e., item\u2019s vector representation, is used in the\nsimilarity evaluation.\nThe item embedding is\ngenerated from a large number of existing user-\nitem interactions, via, e.g., matrix factorization\n[24] methods, which works effectively for non-\nLLM RecSys.\nHowever, this is a very strong\nattack assumption. In practice, the interaction\nmatrix may not be accessible. We do not know\nwhether and how the similarity-based method\nstill works for LLM-based RecSys outputs, e.g.,\nvia general text semantic embedding.\n\u2022 Existing RecSys MIAs [41, 43, 46] assume that\nthe training data distribution is known by the\nadversary, which is used to train shadow mod-\nels offline to mimic the behavior of the target\nmodel, which are then used to build the attack\nmodel. In LLM-based RecSys, the training data\nnow appear in the system prompts. The concept\nof shadow models needs to be re-examined and\nit is unclear whether the assumption of known\ntraining data distribution is necessary and how\nit can be used in attacks.\n\u2022 LLMs have some distinct features that other ma-\nchine learning models do not have, such as hal-\nlucination [25] and memorization [6]. These fea-\ntures might enable new attacks distinct from\nthose on traditional RecSys models.\nHowever,\nno study has been done on attacks utilizing such\nfeatures for LLM RecSys.\nTo our knowledge, no MIA method has been re-\nported on LLM-based RecSys. Understanding such\nnew MIA methods will allow LLM RecSys designers\nto be aware of potential privacy threats and incorpo-\nrate privacy protection measures into system design.\nScope of Our Research. We design, evaluate and\nanalyze four membership inference attacks on LLM-\npowered RecSys that use in-context learning, i.e.,\nprompts, to customize the recommendation. These\nattacks target the private user-item interactions1\nembedded in system prompts by the LLM RecSys\nprovider.\nWe assume that the attacker has known\nthe target user\u2019s historical interactions but not known\nwhether any of these interactions were used by the\nLLM RecSys to compose the system prompts.\n\u2022 Direct Inquiry attack utilizes the basic gener-\native features of LLMs, where the attacker di-\nrectly asks the LLM whether it has seen the vic-\ntim user.\n\u2022 Hallucination attack investigates the likeli-\nhood that LLM hallucination may occur more\noften when the system has not seen the query.\nThis attack explores the novel application of the\nunique LLM hallucination phenomenon.\n\u2022 Similarity attack identifies target users as mem-\nbers if items recommended by LLM have high\nsimilarity to the user\u2019s historical interactions\nknown by the adversary. It resembles the sim-\nilarity attack in the traditional RecSys MIA.\nHowever, since the RecSys-specific item embed-\nding is not available for LLMs, we will depend\non general text embedding to evaluate similarity.\n\u2022 Poisoning attack uses the modified historical\ninteractions as user-provided additional prompts\nand observes the change in recommended items\nto infer whether the target user is a member.\nThe intuition is that if the user\u2019s interactions\nwere used by the system, it may memorize them\nand the poisoned interactions less likely change\nthe system\u2019s recommendations. This attack ex-\nplores another unique feature: LLM memoriza-\ntion, in MIAs.\nWe have conducted extensive experiments on three\npopular large language models that have been used to\ndevelop LLM RecSys and two well-known benchmark\ndatasets: MovieLens-1M and Amazon Digital Music.\nEmpirical results confirm that several attacks work\nsurprisingly well, raising significant alarms for LLM\nRecSys practitioners.\nThe Inquiry attack achieves\n1In the following, for simplicity, we use \u201cinteractions\u201d to\nrepresent tuples (user, item, interaction score).\n2\n\nzero-shot ICL\n\nInstruction task:\nPretend you are a movie recommender system. Your task is to\nrecommend the top 10 movies that the user is likely to watch, excluding\nany movies the user has already seen.\n\nExample:\n\nJames Wiseman watched The Insider, ... ,Big Daddy and based on his\nwatched history, the top 10 recommended item with descending order is\nin the following:\n\nMission: Impossible 2, ..., American Pie.\n\nfew-shot ICL\n\nMelissa Lumbar watched Captain American... , Three sisters and based\non her watched history, the top 10 recommended item with descending\norder is in the following: Baby, Firework, ..., lron Man\n\nover 99% attack advantage, which defined as 2*(MIA\naccuracy-0.5)*100%, in inferring membership status\nagainst Llama3-8b on both datasets; the Poisoning\nAttack achieves over 70% attack advantage in in-\nferring membership status against Llama2-7b on the\nMovieLens-1M and over 80% advantage on Amazon\nDigital Music.\nWe further analyze factors influencing successful at-\ntacks, including the number of shots used by system\nprompts and the positions of the attacked shots in the\nprompt. The results shows these factors have varying\neffect on different LLMs and datasets. These findings\nmay offer insights for designing system prompts that\nare more resilient against privacy attacks.\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to\npropose and study membership inference attacks\nagainst ICL-LLM-powered RecSys.\n\u2022 We have designed Direct Inquiry, Hallucination,\nSimilarity, and Poisoning attacks, aiming to ef-\nfectively detect whether users are used in RecSys\nsystem prompts.\n\u2022 We have conducted extensive experiments to\nshow the performance of these attacks, among\nwhich Direct Inquiry and Poisoning attacks work\nbest for some LLMs. We have also studied the\nfactors affecting these attacks.\nThe remaining sections include a discussion on the\nrelated work focusing on MIAs on RecSys and LLMs\n(Section 2), the preliminaries about the proposed\nmethods describing how ICL-LLM-powered RecSys\nworks (Section 3), the new threat model (Section 4),\nthe four MIA methods (Section 5), the experimen-\ntal evaluation exploring the attack performance and\nfactors affecting these attacks (Section 6), and a con-\nclusion about this study (Section 7).\n2\nRelated Work\nIn this section, we introduce current status of MIA\nstudies on LLM and on RecSys, respectively.\n2.1\nMIA on LLMs\nMembership inference attack (MIA) is one of the\nmost fundamental forms of privacy attacks [5, 27],\nwhere an adversary seeks to determine whether a par-\nticular sample was part of a model\u2019s training dataset\n[5, 27]. While widely studied in traditional machine\nlearning [22, 27, 32, 42], MIA has become increasingly\nconcerning in the context of large language models\n(LLMs), as revealing whether specific data appears\nin prompts can lead to breaches of sensitive or pri-\nvate information.\nTheoretical foundations of MIA largely rely on the\nobservation that models behave more confidently on\nsamples seen during training [5, 27]. A common at-\ntack strategy is to train a classifier attack model\nusing the target model\u2019s output posteriors\u2019 proba-\nbilities, where higher-confidence outputs are deemed\nmore likely to be members. To improve attack perfor-\nmance, researchers have also incorporated additional\ncues such as intermediate representations [33], loss\ntrajectories [31], or trained shadow models on crafted\ndatasets [5]. In all of these instances, it seems that\nhaving access to the model posterior is a necessary\nrequirement for launching the attack. Most existing\nmembership inference attacks against LLMs necessi-\ntate, at a minimum, access to the probability associ-\nated with predictions. This requirement is crucial for\ncalculating corresponding loss [16, 40] or perplexity\n[7, 8], which can then be used to extract membership\nsignals.\nRecent work has explored posterior-free MIA tech-\nniques [13, 29] that infer membership by estimating a\nsample\u2019s distance to the decision boundary. However,\nsuch approaches have their own challenges due to\ntheir black-box nature and the discrete input space.\nRui et al. [39] proposed text-only MIAs against LLMs\non the classification task which cannot apply to rec-\nommendation task due to the entirely different prob-\nlem settings.\n2.2\nMIA on RecSys\nThe earlier RecSys MIA studies are focused on the\nuser level. Zhang et al. [42] propose the Item-Diff\nmethod for inferring membership in a target RecSys\nby analyzing the similarity between a user\u2019s historical\ninteractions and recommended items. The core idea\nis that, for users in the training set, their historical\ninteractions are likely to be more closely aligned with\nthe items recommended by the system. Wang et al.\n[38] propose the DL-MIA framework to improve Item-\nDiff with a VAE-based encoder and weight estima-\ntor to address issues with Item-Diff. More recently,\nWei et al. [41] proposed a white-box interaction-level\nmembership inference on federated RecSys.\nZhong\net al. [46] proposed another interaction-level mem-\nbership inference on Knowledge Graph-based RecSys,\nutilizing the similarity matrix between the interacted\nitems and the recommended items.\nTo our knowl-\nedge, no MIA study is reported on LLM RecSys.\n3\n\n3\nPreliminaries\nIn this section, we introduce In-context learning Rec-\nSys in Section 3.1\n3.1\nIn-context learning(ICL) RecSys\nIn-Context Learning (ICL) is a distinctive feature\nof large language models (LLMs) [4], enabling them\nto perform specific tasks by observing a few ex-\namples\u2014without updating model parameters.\nICL\nLLMs learn through analogy [15] by appending input-\noutput demonstrations, known as prompts, during in-\nference. Introduced alongside GPT-3 [4],\nFigure 2: System Architecture for ICL-RecSys\nICL has proven effective in adapting LLMs to vari-\nous downstream tasks, particularly in recommenda-\ntion systems (RecSys). According to Gao et al. [17],\nits success stems from the design of prompts and in-\ncontext demonstrations. In other words, the key in-\nnovation of ICL is to elicit the in-context ability of\nLLMs for learning (new or unseen) downstream tasks\nfrom context during the inference stage. In partic-\nular, two settings proposed in ICL are prevalently\nleveraged for prompting LLMs for RecSys: few-shot,\nwhere the model is guided by a few input-output ex-\namples, and zero-shot, where only natural language\ntask descriptions are provided.\nBoth rely on the\nmodel\u2019s ability to generalize from context, but few-\nshot ICL typically achieves better performance due\nto the inclusion of in-context demonstrations. Sev-\neral studies compare these settings under the same\nrecommendation tasks [30, 44, 45] and find that few-\nshot learning outperforms zero-shot approaches.\nTo adapt large language models (LLMs) to recom-\nmendation tasks via in-context learning (ICL), a\nstraightforward strategy is to prompt LLMs to act\nas recommenders. For instance, Liu et al. [30] uti-\nlize ChatGPT with task-specific prompts for top-k\nrecommendation and explanation generation. Their\nmethod involves constructing tailored input-output\nexamples for each task, demonstrating that few-shot\nsettings consistently yield better performance than\nzero-shot ones. Similarly, other studies have proposed\ndistinct strategies for designing effective in-context\ndemonstrations to enhance recommendation perfor-\nmance. For example, [45] introduces role-based tex-\ntual descriptions, such as \u201cYou are a book rating ex-\npert,\u201d to augment in-context prompts. This role in-\njection technique helps mitigate cases where LLMs\nrefuse to perform recommendation tasks (e.g., re-\nsponding with \u201cAs a language model, I don\u2019t have the\nability to recommend ...\u201d). In summary, ICL serves\nas a critical bridge connecting LLMs with down-\nstream tasks such as recommendation systems, en-\nabling LLMs to emulate the behavior of traditional\nrecommenders and effectively interact with users.\nFigure 2 shows how an LLM-based RecSys may look\nlike.\nThe core components include the LLM, the\ndatabase containing many users\u2019 historical interac-\ntions, and a prompt composer that can adapt to the\nrecommendation task and each specific user\u2019s prefer-\nences.\nIn this work, we propose a text-only membership in-\nference attack on ICL-based RecSys, which operates\nunder the most constrained setting: the adversary\nonly has access to the user interacted item and gener-\nated recommended item, not the probabilities, which\naligns with the common black-box setting in the rec-\nommendation task [42].\nFigure 3: Prompt Example\n4\nTHREAT MODEL\n4.1\nAdversary\u2019s Objective\nThe primary objective of the adversary is to deter-\nmine whether a specific target user u was included\nin the construction of a prompt used to customize a\n4\n\n~ a\n\u2014_\u2014__ >\n\nRecommendations User\n\nSystem\nprompts\n\nPrompt\nComposer\n\nUsers\u2019 historical\ninteractions\n\nInstruction task:\nPretend you are a movie recommender system. Your task is to\nrecommend the top 10 movies that the user is likely to watch, excluding\nany movies the user has already seen.\n\nExample:\n\nJames Wiseman watched The Insider, ... ,;Big Daddy and based on his\nwatched history, the top 10 recommended item with descending order is\nin the following:\n\nMission: Impossible 2, ..., American Pie.\n\nMelissa Lumbar watched Captain American... , Three sisters and based\non her watched history, the top 10 recommended item with descending\norder is in the following: Baby, Firework, ..., lron Man\n\n3\n\n\nlanguage model M. The prompt, denoted as prompt,\ncomprises a set of k examples, formatted as:\nprompt = {Instruction task, (u1, i1, s1), . . . , (uk, ik, sk)},\nwhere uj and ij are from the user set U, and item\nset I, correspondingly. sj is a score defined by a spe-\ncific scoring method, i.e., binary 0/1 for \u201cclicked\u201d or\n\u201cnot clicked\u201d or a multi-scale grade, e.g., from like to\ndislike. For simplicity, we have used the binary sam-\nples \u2013 (uk, ik) implies the user uk interacted ik. The\ndetailed prompt sample is shown in Figure 3. The\nadversary\u2019s goal is to determine whether the target\nuser u has been utilized in crafting the system prompt\nthat the LLM RecSys has used to improve the rele-\nvance of recommended items, i.e., to find out whether\nu \u2208{u1, . . . , uk}.\n4.2\nAdversary\u2019s Capabilities\nThe adversary can access the large language model\nfor RecSys, customized via prompts in a known for-\nmat, as indicated in previous research in LLM RecSys\n[25, 30]. The adversary has known the target user\u2019s\nhistorical interactions and wanted to know whether\nthey are used in prompts. We consider the most strict\nand realistic scenario, where the adversary has only\nblack-box access to the target language model M and\nits recommended items, but not the tokenizer or the\nassociated output probabilities. We also assume the\nadversary can access general word embeddings ob-\ntained via open-source LLMs (not the target LLM),\nwhich can be used in the similarity attack.\n5\nATTACK METHODS\n5.1\nDirect Inquiry Attack\nIntuition. The core concept of this attack method\nhinges on the language model\u2019s ability to remem-\nber information from past conversations and deliver\ncontext-based responses.\nWhen we interact with a\nlanguage model, it processes the context and pro-\nduces a response informed by the knowledge it has\nacquired from previous inputs by the user, particu-\nlarly from the interaction examples included in the\nRecSys system prompts. Consequently, an intuitive\napproach is to directly question the language model\nabout its previous encounters with specific samples.\nMethod. The attack methodology is structured as\nfollows (refer to Figure 4 for an illustration):\n\u2022 The adversary selects a target user u to deter-\nmine whether the user showed up in prompts.\nFigure 4: The direct inquiry attack\n\u2022 The adversary crafts a query to the model with\nthe prompt: \u201cHave you seen the user u? Only\nAnswer Yes or No\u201d.\n\u2022 The adversary sends the query to the model and\nobserves the model\u2019s response. If the model con-\nfirms with a \u201cyes\u201d, the user is considered as a\nmember of the dataset; if not, it is considered a\nnon-member.\nFor LLMs that memorize the prompts, this attack\nmight work. We have witnessed Llama-3 behaves so\nin experiments.\n5.2\nHallucination Attack\nIntuition. Hallucination is a common problem with\nLLMs.\nIn LLM-based RecSys, hallucination may\ncause the LLM to recommend items out of the do-\nmain, i.e., the global item set I.\nWhen we inter-\nact with a language model, it processes the context\nand recommends items provided by the user conver-\nsation and system prompts. We hypothesize that if\nthe model has seen something related to the user be-\nfore, the probability of hallucinated items might be\nlower.\nSpecifically, if the number is higher than a\nthreshold, it is likely a non-member.\nMethod. The attack method consists of the follow-\ning steps (see Figure 5 for an illustration):\n\u2022 The adversary selects a target user u to deter-\nmine the membership.\n\u2022 The adversary crafts a query to the model with a\nprompt, e.g., \u201cPlease recommend top-10 movies\nsorted in descending order of relevance for u.\nOnly give movie names without any description\u201d.\n\u2022 The adversary counts the number of hallucinated\nitems in the set of recommended items out of\n5\n\nPretend you are a movie recommender system. Your\ntask is to recommend the top 10 movies that the user is\nlikely to watch, excluding any movies the user has\nalready seen.\n\nJames Wiseman watched The Insider, ... ,Big Daddy and\nbased on his watched history, the top 10 recommended\nitem with descending order is in the following: Mission:\nImpossible 2, ..., American Pie.\n\nHave you seen James Wiseman before? Please answer\none word: Yes or No\n\n\nFigure 5: The hallucination attack\nthe defined item set I. If this number is larger\nthan threshold it is considered a non-member,\nvice versa.\nIn experiments, we have used IMDB to generate the\nglobal item set, I, for movies, and MusicBrainz for\nmusics. A threshold of 2 for 10 recommended items\nseems to work for the experimented models. How-\never, the attack advantages are low.\n5.3\nSimilarity Attack\nIntuition.\nThis attack uses the memorization ca-\npability of language models to estimate whether the\nLLM recommended items similar to the user\u2019s histor-\nical item interactions known by the adversary. We\nhypothesize that if the LLM has seen the user\u2019s his-\ntorical interactions, the recommended items might\nbe similar to historical interactions. This similarity-\nbased attack is borrowed from the attack on tradi-\ntional RecSys models [42]. However, the similarity\ncalculation is the key. The previous attack made the\nstrong assumption that the adversary also knows the\nitem embedding vectors derived from a large set of\nknown interactions. Considering it is almost impos-\nsible to get such embedding vectors in realistic at-\ntacks without breaking into the RecSys internal. We\nredesigned the similarity measuring method for LLM\nRecSys with general semantic text embedding gener-\nated by LLMs. We then use the following method\nto estimate the similarity between the recommended\nitems and the user\u2019s historical interactions.\nMethod. The attack method consists of the follow-\ning steps (see Figure 6 for an illustration):\nFigure 6: The similarity attack\n\u2022 The adversary selects a target user u to deter-\nmine its membership status.\n\u2022 The adversary crafts a query to the model with\na prompt like \u201cPlease recommend top-10 movies\nsorted by a descending order of relevance for u.\nOnly give movie names without any description\u201d.\n\u2022 The attacker calculates the pairwise similar-\nity between each recommended item and each\nitem in the historical interaction set. The aver-\nage similarity is used to infer membership sta-\ntus. If the average similarity exceeds a prede-\nfined threshold \u03c4, the interaction is classified as\na member; otherwise, it is considered a non-\nmember. Formally, let R = {r1, r2, . . . , rm} de-\nnote the set of recommended items and I =\n{i1, i2, . . . , in} denote the historical interacted\nitems. Let sim(r, i) denote a similarity function\nbetween items r and i. The average similarity is\ncomputed as:\nAvgSim(Ru, Iu) =\n1\nm \u00b7 n\nX\nr\u2208Ru\nX\ni\u2208Iu\nsim(r, i). (1)\nIn experiments, we have used the Sentence-\nTransformer network [34], a widely utilized text\nencoder, to embed items and the cosine similar-\nity for pairwise similarity calculation. However,\nwe noticed that LLMs will not duplicate the seen\nhistorical items or fine-tune the list, even though\nthe user has been included in prompts, which\nis expected for a reasonable RecSys. Therefore,\nsince the general text embedding does not con-\ntain the unique user-item interaction information\nas the traditional item embedding does [42], we\n6\n\nPretend you are a movie recommender system.

We design the poisoning attack to fur-\nther exploit the memorization capability of LLMs.\nWe hypothesize that if the model has previously seen\nthe target user\u2019s interactions, it will exhibit a certain\ndegree of \u201cstubbornness\u201d. Specifically, if the adver-\nsary shows additional prompts that contain the tar-\ngeted user\u2019s modified historical interactions, the LLM\nhaving the memory of the correct historical interac-\ntions is less likely to change its mind. In contrast, if\nthe model has not seen the historical interactions, its\nrecommended items might be more influenced by the\nprovided modified items.\nFigure 7: The poisoning attack\nMethod. It consists of the following steps (see Fig-\nure 7 for an illustration):\n\u2022 The adversary selects a target user u to deter-\nmine its membership status.\n\u2022 The adversary crafts a query to the model with\na prompt like \u201cPlease recommend top-10 movies\nsorted by the descending order of relevance for\nu. Only give movie names without any descrip-\ntion.\u201d\nThe system returns the initial recom-\nmended items R0.\n\u2022 The adversary further provides a prompt with\nthe modified historical interactions, e.g., \u201cThe\nuser James Wiseman previously interacted with\nitems (i1, i2, . . . , in), can you recommended an-\nother list of 10 movies?\u201d\nThe modified list\n(i1, i2, . . . , in) is generated as follows. The ad-\nversary randomly selects and replaces items in\na user\u2019s original interaction set Iu with low-\nsimilarity items from the total set I.\nIn the\nmovie recommendation case, we used all the\nmovies in the IMDB dataset.\nSpecifically, for\na selected item i0\nk \u2208Iu, the attacker substitutes\nit with an item ik such that:\nik = arg\nmin\nj\u2208IMDB sim(i0\nk, j).\n(2)\n\u2022 The attacker gets another list of recommended\nitems, R1. Then the similarity between R0 and\nR1 is calculated with the same average similar-\nity formula Eq. 1. The membership inference\ndecision is based on the similarity gap. If the\nsimilarity gap is less than the predefined \u03c4, it im-\nplies the LLM\u2019s decision is less likely influenced\nby the modified list, and the user\u2019s interactions\nmay have shown up in the system\u2019s prompts.\n6\nEXPERIMENTS\nThe experiments try to answer the following ques-\ntions in our attack design. (1) Will the RecSys LLM\nlikely leak the user\u2019s information via direct inquiry?\n(2) Can the previously reported similarity-checking\nattack [42, 46] also work in the LLM context? (3)\nCan the LLM\u2019s memorization feature be explored to\ninfer membership? (4) What are the factors affecting\nthe performance of membership inference?\n6.1\nExperiment setup\nLarge Language Models. We evaluate our attacks\non three representative language models, including\nLlama-2 [36], Llama-3 [36], and Vicuna [12] that have\nbeen used in studying LLM RecSys [25, 44].\nFor\nLlama-2 and Llama-3, we utilize the 7B and 8B ver-\nsions, respectively.\nVicuna is an instruct-finetuned\nversion of Llama-2.\nWe utilize the 13B version of\nVicuna.\nIn general, newer models may have im-\nproved some aspects, i.e., the reduced hallucinations\nand better relevance of the recommended items. We\nuse these models for experiments because they have\nshown their effectiveness for RecSys in previous stud-\nies.\nMore recent models, e.g., Llama-4, may show\nbetter recommendation performance.\nHowever, to\nisolate the unknown factors, we decide to use these\nmodels only for easier comparison and better repro-\nducibility.\nDatasets.\nWe assess the impact of our attacks\non MovieLens-1M [21] and Amazon Digital Music\n[26].\nThe statistic of the dataset is shown in Ta-\nble 1. For hallucination attack, we use IMDB [1] on\n7\n\nPretend you are a movie recommender system.

Also, we find\nthe MusicBrainz [2] can be used as corpus on the\nAmazon Digital Music to decide whether the LLM\u2019s\noutput is hallucinated item. The recommendation-\nspecific prompts are designed using the template pro-\nvided by Liu et al. [30] known for its verified perfor-\nmance.\nIt is worth noting that our objective is to\ndetermine if the target user information is used in\nthe system prompt.\nHowever, it is likely that the\nLLM has seen relevant text samples in the original\nLLM pre-training data, which we cannot distinguish.\nHowever, as demonstrated in this study [39], LLMs\nexhibit significantly weaker memorization about pre-\ntraining data, compared to the data in prompts.\nEvaluation Metrics.\nSince we focus on whether\neach attack works and their relative performance over\ndifferent settings, we consider the widely adopted\nmetric in related studies [39] \u2013 the attack advantage:\nAdv = 2 \u00d7 (Acc \u22120.5),\n(3)\nwhere Acc is the attack accuracy. It measures the\nadvantage over random guessing: random guessing\nremains at 0, while a perfect attack gives 1. Other\nMIA studies [5, 46] have used more fine-grained met-\nrics, such as true positive rate (TPR) at low false\npositive rate (FPR), to precisely compare different\nMIA attacks.\nHowever, as the first MIA study on\nLLM RecSys, our focus is to show whether there are\neffective MIA attacks on the LLM RecSys approach.\nThus, attack advantage is sufficient.\nExperiment Design. Each dataset is de-duplicated\nand randomly partitioned into two disjoint subsets:\nthe member set and the non-member set. For each\ntrial, a number of samples, i.e., the \u201cshots\u201d are ran-\ndomly drawn from the member set to form the system\nprompt, one of which is selected as the member sam-\nple, while a random sample from the non-member\nset serves as the non-member. Repeating this pro-\ncess 500 times results in a balanced evaluation set\nconsisting of 500 member and 500 non-member sam-\nples. We also simulate the RecSys system prompts\nwith a different number of shots to investigate the\nrelationship between the system prompt setting vs at-\ntack effectiveness. The 500 independent experiments\nfor each setting, i.e., the specific LLM and the num-\nber of shots, ensure the statistical significance of our\nfindings.\n6.2\nResult Analysis\nOur experimental results show that the two attacks:\ndirect inquiry and poisoning attacks work effectively,\nwhile the other two: hallucination and similarity at-\ntacks are unsatisfactory.\nWe organize them in the\nsame order.\nMeanwhile, we found that several factors affect the\neffectiveness of the attacks, including the number of\nshots used by the system prompt, the position of the\nattacked shot in the system prompt, and different\nLLMs. For each attack, we will explore these impor-\ntant factors.\n6.2.1\nDirect Inquiry\nWe find Direct Inquiry works surprisingly well on\nLlama-3, which likely memorizes and utilizes the\nprompts better than older models.\nOlder models,\nLlama-2 and Vicuna, do not work in this attack. Fig-\nure 8 shows the comparison on the most effective case:\none-shot system prompt. For other settings, the older\nmodels give almost zero attack advantage and thus\nignored. Both older models tend to blindly give the\nsame answer regardless of whether the sample is a\nmember or nonmember. As this attack fully depends\non the basic generative ability and prompt memo-\nrization of the LLM, it makes sense that newer LLMs\nmay be more vulnerable to this attack.\nLlama-3\nVicuna\nLlama-2\n0\n0.5\n1\nAttack Advantage\nMovie\nMusic\nFigure 8: Best Direct Inquery performance for each\nLLM and dataset.\nFigure 9 shows more details about this attack on both\ndatasets with Llama-3.\nThe attack performance is\nalso affected by the number of shots used by the sys-\ntem prompt, and the shot position that contains the\ntargeted user. Interestingly, the more shots used by\n8\n\nthe system prompt, the less likely this attack will\nsucceed, which implies that the system designer can\nsimply increase the shots to make the RecSys more\nresilient to this type of attack. The targeted shot po-\nsition also plays a role in attack results. \u201cMovie-first\u201d\nin the figure means the victim happens to be at the\nfirst position of the system prompt. The victim at\nthe earlier shot positions seems more vulnerable than\nlater ones.\n1-shot\n5-shot\n10-shot\n0\n0.5\n1\nAttack Advantage\nMovie-first\nMovie-last\nMusic-first\nMusic-last\nFigure 9: Attack advantage of direct inquiry against\nLlama-3 with different shot counts and attacked shot\npositions (e.g., Movie-first for the first shot position\non the movie dataset).\n6.2.2\nPoisoning Attack\nPoisoning attack shows different patterns from the\ndirect inquiry attack. This attack has a unique ad-\nditional factor: the number of poisoned items, which\nare crafted by the attacker in the additional attacker-\nprovided prompt. We find that both the number of\nshots in system prompts and the number of poisoned\nitems in attacker\u2019s prompts affect the attack perfor-\nmance. Interestingly, different datasets may show dif-\nferent affecting patterns, possibly due to the dataset-\nrelated topic and its relevant content in the origi-\nnal pre-training dataset. Similar to the first experi-\nment, we experimented with 1-shot, 5-shot, and 10-\nshot system prompts. In addition, we investigated 2-\npoison, 5-poison, and 8-poison items in the attacker\u2019s\nprompts. With a similarity gap threshold \u03c4 around\n0.3 to 0.45, we can achieve satisfactory MIA perfor-\nmance. Figure 10 summarizes the best performing\nMIA result under all settings for each LLM and each\ndataset. Different from the previous attack, an old-\nversion LLM, Llama-2, shows the best performance\nfor both datasets.\nWe look into the Llama-2 results in more detail. Since\nthe poisoning process randomly takes a number of\nitems to poison, we do not distinguish the effect of\nLlama-2\nLlama-3\nVicuna\n0\n0.5\n1\nAttack Advantage\nMovie\nMusic\nFigure 10: Best attack advantage under poisoning for\ndifferent models and domains\npoisoning the first or the last shot. Figure 11 on the\nmovie dataset shows that more poisoned items may\nslightly increase the chance of MIA success, while\nmore shots may reduce the MIA performance. Fig-\nure 12 on the music dataset shows that the number\nof shots has more significant effect on MIA: the more\nshots, the worse MIA performs, while the pattern of\nthe number of poisoned items is unclear.\n1-shot\n5-shot\n10-shot\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nAttack Advantage\n2-poisoned\n5-poisoned\n8-poisoned\nFigure 11: Poisoning Attack advantage for Llama-2\non movie dataset with k-shots in the system prompt\nand m number of poisoned items provided by the at-\ntacker.

Most other settings give advantages\naround 0.1 or lower. We take the threshold = 2, i.e.,\nthe number of hallucinated items, to classify mem-\nbers and non-members, which gives the best perfor-\n9\n\n1-shot\n5-shot\n10-shot\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nAttack Advantage\n2-poisoned\n5-poisoned\n8-poisoned\nFigure 12: Poisoning Attack advantage for Llama-2\non music dataset with k-shots in the system prompt\nand m number of poisoned items.\nThe advantage\ndecreases with more shots\nmance.\nFigure 13 summarizes the best results for\neach dataset and each LLM on 1-shot, 5-shot, and\n10-shot settings.\nVicuna\nLlama-2\nLlama-3\n0\n0.2\n0.4\nAttack Advantage\nMovie\nMusic\nFigure 13: Vicuna is the most vulnerable in the hal-\nlucination attack. However, this attack has signifi-\ncantly worse performance than the direct inquiry and\nthe poisoning attacks.\nFigure 14 looks into the details for the best perform-\ning Vinuna model. We also examine whether the at-\ntacked shot position (first and last) affects the result.\nWhile the attack performance was miserable for the\nmovie dataset, it does show a trend of slight increas-\ning performance with the increase of shots. However,\nthere is no clear pattern on attacking the first or the\nlast shot position, although the best performing at-\ntack happens at the last shot on the 5-shot setting\nfor the music dataset.\n1-shot\n5-shot\n10-shot\n0\n0.2\n0.4\nAttack Advantage\nMovie-first\nMovie-last\nMusic-first\nMusic-last\nFigure 14: Hallucination attack with Vicuna.

However, this attack overall performs\nthe worst among other attacks.\nThe similarity attack on traditional RecSys [42]\nutilizes the item embeddings derived from the in-\nteraction matrix to achieve good attacking perfor-\nmance. While such a known RecSys-specific embed-\nding scheme is a very strong assumption, our poor\nsimilarity attack performance indicates that the gen-\neral text embedding scheme may not have the infor-\nmation that the interaction-based embedding has.\n6.3\nDiscussion\nIn our initial study of the novel MIAs on LLM-based\nRecSys, we have identified that at least two effective\nattacks: direct inquiry and poisoning. They perform\n10\n\nsurprisingly well on the well-known public RecSys\ndatasets.\nHowever, the use of different versions of\nLLMs leads to diverse results, which is partially tied\nto the match between the nature of the attack and the\nfeatures of different versions of LLMs. For example,\nthe direct inquiry attack utilizes the prompt memo-\nrization feature and the generalization power of the\nLLMs, the later models may give better performance.\nHowever, this type of attacks can be easily mitigated\nvia model alignment, i.e., fine-tuning the model not\nto answer such kind of queries. The poisoning attack\nsomehow utilizes the weakness, i.e., the memoriza-\ntion ability of older LLMs and thus these LLMs are\nmore vulnerable to this attack. Recent LLMs have\nlikely incorporated various techniques [20, 35] to ad-\ndress the memorization issue and thus less influenced\nby such attacks.\nThe hallucination attack performs unsatisfactorily.\nOur results were almost against our initial design hy-\npothesis: the seen information may lead to less hallu-\ncination. This indeed happened for a few cases, e.g.,\nolder models, like Llama-2 that likely has stronger\nmemorization and hallucination, but the attack ad-\nvantage is marginal.\nThe similarity attack performs badly. It is partly due\nto the significant difference between the general text\nembedding and the interaction-matrix based embed-\nding. However, it also leaves space for improvement.\nThere might be a better similarity attack to achieve\nperformance comparable to our top ranked attacks.\n7\nConclusion\nWith LLMs potentially used for developing next-\ngeneration RecSys, the new privacy risks should be\nthoroughly understood. We designed four novel MIA\nattacks, specifically targeting LLM-based RecSys,\nand have shown that at least two of the attacks: di-\nrect inquiry and poisoning work effectively.\nThus,\nwe confirm that the membership inference threat on\nLLM-based RecSys is realistic.\nPractitioners and\nresearchers of LLM RecSys should carefully design\nschemes to address such privacy threats. We will also\nextend this study to more MIA attacks and design\ncorresponding mitigation methods.\nReferences\n[1] Imdb, 2024.\n[2] Musicbrainz, 2024.\n[3] Bao, K., Zhang, J., Zhang, Y., Wang, W.,\nFeng, F., and He, X.

In many cases,\nthe same sentence can have different meanings depending on the\nemotional expression.\nFurthermore, emotional understanding is\nessential for improving user experience in human-machine interac-\ntion. Currently, most speech LLMs with empathetic capabilities are\ntrained on massive datasets. This approach requires vast amounts\nof data and significant computational resources. Therefore, a key\nchallenge lies in how to develop a speech LLM capable of gener-\nating empathetic responses with limited data and without the need\nfor large-scale training. To address this challenge, we propose Emo-\ntion Omni, a novel model architecture designed to understand the\nemotional content of user speech input and generate empathetic\nspeech responses.\nAdditionally, we developed a data generation\npipeline based on an open-source TTS framework to construct a\n200k emotional dialogue dataset, which supports the construction\nof an empathetic speech assistant.\nThe demos are available at\nhttps://w311411.github.io/omni_demo/.\nIndex Terms\u2014 Speech LLM, omni, emotional speech, speech\nassistant\n1. INTRODUCTION\nWith the emergence of groundbreaking technologies such as GPT-\n4o [1], the integration between speech capabilities and large lan-\nguage models (LLMs) has dramatically enhanced user experience,\nsignificantly expanding their practical applications across diverse\nscenarios ranging from customer service and educational platforms\nto personal assistants and therapeutic interventions. Several inno-\nvative end-to-end multimodal voice interaction models have been\ndeveloped, including Mini-Omni [2], LLaMA-Omni [3], and Vo-\ncalNet [4], which represent a paradigm shift by eliminating the\ntraditional pipeline approach that relies on separate speech-to-text\ntranscription processes. Instead, these models achieve direct, fast\ngeneration of both textual and speech responses from voice com-\nmands, streamlining the interaction flow and reducing latency.\nHowever, beyond simple semantic question answering, speech\ninteraction heavily relies on a deep understanding of paralinguis-\ntic information [5, 6]. Paralinguistic features, such as the speaker\u2019s\nemotions and intentions, play a crucial role in daily conversations,\ngreatly affecting the delivery and response to the information. The\nsame sentence, when expressed with different emotions, conveys en-\ntirely different meanings, which requires speech LLMs to accurately\ninterpret the user\u2019s emotional intent and generate appropriate em-\npathetic responses. Otherwise, the speech interaction system may\nmisunderstand the user\u2019s intent or respond inappropriately, leading\nto a significant decrease in user experience. Otherwise, the speech\ninteraction system may misunderstand the user\u2019s intent or respond\ninappropriately, leading to a significant decrease in user experience.\nThis challenge becomes particularly pronounced in applications re-\nquiring high emotional intelligence, such as mental health support,\ncustomer service, and educational tutoring, where empathetic com-\nmunication is essential for building trust and rapport.\nInspired by the advances of prosodic and emotional natural\nspeech dialogue systems\n[7\u20139], recent speech language models\n(SLMs) focus on generating empathetic responses [10, 11]. How-\never, most of these remain rely on large datasets.\nTo address this issue, we propose an innovative end-to-end ar-\nchitecture that directly utilizes the emotional features in speech to\nrecognize and precisely control the generation of empathetic speech\nLLMs. By inputting both the emotional and semantic features of\nthe speech, we can generate not only the content of the speech re-\nsponses but also the emotional features required to control the tone\nand emotion of the speech output. This approach avoids the biases\nthat may exist in text descriptions and allows for a more detailed un-\nderstanding of the emotional variations within the speech. Further-\nmore, by leveraging open-source TTS frameworks and an efficient\npipeline design, we have constructed a low-cost, scalable emotional\ndialogue dataset, significantly reducing the need for manual labeling\nand lowering the costs of building emotional dialogue systems. The\ncontributions are as followed:\n\u2022 Developed an emotion-driven speech LLM: Our speech\nLLM not only recognizes the user\u2019s emotional intent but also\ngenerates corresponding empathetic speech responses, sig-\nnificantly enhancing the system\u2019s ability to understand and\nrespond to emotions.\n\u2022 Built an efficient emotional dialogue dataset generation\npipeline: We designed and implemented a pipeline for gen-\nerating emotional dialogue datasets, greatly reducing the cost\nof developing emotional speech systems and minimizing re-\nliance on large amounts of manually labeled data.\nThrough these innovations, we have successfully built a low-\ncost, efficient, and reproducible empathetic speech LLM, signif-\nicantly reducing the required training data and computational re-\nsources, and providing a flexible and efficient solution for future\nempathetic speech interaction systems.\narXiv:2508.18655v1  [cs.CL]  26 Aug 2025\n\nFig. 1. Model Architecture and Training Process. In Stage 1, we fine-tune the LLM backbone with LoRA to align speech and text, focusing\non understanding speech cues and generating empathetic responses. In Stage 2.1, the text embeddings are input to the speech decoder to train\nbasic speech generation. In Stage 2.2, the gated fusion module combines LLM hidden states, text embeddings, and emotional cues for better\nquality.\n2. METHODS\nSimilar to LLaMA Omni [3], we utilize pre-trained speech and emo-\ntion encoders to extract semantic and emotional features from input\nspeech, facilitating alignment learning between the speech and text\nmodalities of the LLM. Subsequently, we leverage the LLM\u2019s output\nhidden states to predict the sequential emotional features of the re-\nsponse speech and explicitly output emotional instructions for the\nresponse. Before inputting to the speech decoder, the LLM hid-\nden states are fused with text embeddings and modulated by the\npredicted emotional features, enabling the speech decoder to au-\ntoregressively generate speech tokens with target emotions. These\ntokens are then converted into speech waveforms through a flow\nmatching model [12] and HiFiGAN [13], both optimally designed\nfor efficient streaming decoding.\n2.1. Speech Encoder\nWe use Whisper-large-v3 [14] as the speech semantic encoder to\nextract comprehensive linguistic content from speech signals. How-\never, since Whisper primarily captures semantic information while\nlacking comprehensive emotional understanding capabilities, we ad-\nditionally employ the pre-trained Emotion2Vec [15] as the emotional\nfeature encoder to capture paralinguistic emotional information and\nprovide complementary affective cues that are essential for empa-\nthetic speech interaction. This dual-encoder architecture allows our\nmodel to process both the semantic content and emotional context of\nuser speech simultaneously.\nBoth pre-trained models extract and downsample speech features\nfrom the user\u2019s speech input S:\nHsem/emo = Dsem/emo(Esem/emo(S), k)\n(1)\nwhere Esem/emo denotes the Whisper/Emotion2Vec encoders\nrespectively, Dsem/emo are the corresponding downsampling adapters\nresponsible for downsampling the encoded features to 10Hz to re-\nduce sequence length and improve computational efficiency, and\nk is the downsampling factor used to control the degree of tem-\nporal resolution reduction.\nTo preserve the original performance\nof the pre-trained models and ensure training stability, the encoder\nparameters remain frozen throughout the entire training process.\nWe concatenate the semantic and emotional features along the\nfeature dimension to create a unified representation that captures\nboth linguistic content and emotional context. This combined fea-\nture vector is then projected through a linear transformation to match\nthe LLM hidden size, which is subsequently used as the input to the\nlarge language model for generating contextually appropriate and\nemotionally aware responses.\n2.2. Large Language Model\nWe choose Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct [16] as the LLM backbone, which\npossesses strong language understanding and generation capabilities\nand has achieved good alignment with human preferences through\ninstruction tuning.\nSpecifically, given the adapted speech feature sequence Hspeech,\nthe LLM generates text responses in an autoregressive manner.\nP(yt|y<t, Hspeech) = softmax(LLM(Hspeech, y<t))\n(2)\n\n\u00a9 LLM Hidden\nO Text Embedding\noO Emotion Feature\n\u00a9 Fised Hidden\nO Speech Token\n\nVocoder\n\n\u00a9 Concatenate\n\u00ae Sigmoid\n\nSpeech &\nEmotion Encoder\n\nStage 2.1 oO oO C\n=4\n\n\u201c<1 @ @ OOOO\n\n6 Emotion Predict Head\n\ns Large Language Model J\n<\n\nDownsample Adapter\n\nVA % Speech & Emotion Encoder \\\n\nSpeech Decoder\n\nOO 0 O\n\nStage 2.2\n\n6 Speech Decoder }\nEmotion\nPredict Head | Fusion Module\n(ie Large Language Model\n(i Downsample Adapter\n\nVA e Speech & Emotion Encoder \\\n\n\nwhere yt represents the token generated t-th and y<t represents\nthe first token generated t \u22121.\nTo ensure empathetic speech responses, we design an emotion\nprediction head that leverages the LLM\u2019s hidden states to predict the\nemotional features of the response speech. This ensures that the re-\nsponses are both semantically appropriate and emotionally aligned\nwith the user\u2019s input. We first extract frame-level emotional features\nfrom the response speech using an emotion encoder. To align these\nfeatures with the LLM output, we downsample them using a window\naveraging method, adjusting their length to match the LLM output\nsequence. The LLM\u2019s hidden states are then passed to the emotion\nprediction head, which predicts the target emotional features. This\nprocess enables precise control over the emotional tone of the gen-\nerated speech, ensuring it aligns with the user\u2019s emotional needs.\nHtarget\nemo\n[j] = 1\nw\njw\nX\ni=(j\u22121)w+1\nHresponse\nemo\n[i],\nj = 1, 2, . . . , L (3)\nwhere w is the average window size, and Htarget\nemo\n\u2208RL\u00d7De is\nthe downsampled response emotional features.\nThe emotion prediction head maps the LLM\u2019s hidden states to\nthe emotional feature space:\n\u02c6\nHemo = EmoPredictHead(Hout) \u2208RL\u00d7De\n(4)\nThe total model loss function includes text generation loss and\nemotion prediction loss: Ltotal = LLLM + \u03bbLemo, and the emotion\nprediction loss is:\nLemotion = MSE( \u02c6\nHemotion, Htarget\nemo\n)\n+ \u03b1(1 \u2212CosSim( \u02c6\nHemotion, Htarget\nemo\n))\n(5)\nwhere \u03bb and \u03b1 are hyperparameters that balance different loss\nterms, MSE(\u00b7) represents mean squared error loss, and CosSim(\u00b7)\nrepresents cosine similarity. Through this joint training approach,\nthe model can generate text responses that are both semantically co-\nherent and emotionally consistent.\n2.3. Speech Decoder\nTo generate speech responses, we refer to the speech tokenizer from\nCosyVoice2 [17], which discretizes continuous speech signals into\ndiscrete speech units. This tokenizer discretizes continuous speech\nfeatures into speech token sequences by quantifying intermediate\nlayer outputs from the Whisper encoder with Finite Scalar Quanti-\nzation (FSQ) [18]. Our validation shows that CosyVoice2 tokens re-\ntain emotional and paralinguistic features, which support emotional\nspeech generation.\nWhen training the speech decoder, we first directly input the\nLLM label\u2019s text embeddings to build the basic speech generation\ncapability. Then, we use a gate fusion module similar to LLaMA\nOmni 2 to fuse the text embeddings with the LLM hidden states,\nintegrating semantic and contextual information. The gate fusion\nmechanism dynamically balances the contributions of text and con-\ntextual features:\nGateFusion(Htext, Hout) = \u03b1 \u2299Htext + (1 \u2212\u03b1) \u2299Hout\n(6)\nwhere \u03b1 = \u03c3(Wg[Htext, Hout] + bg) is the gating weight com-\nputed via a sigmoid function over the concatenated features. This\ntwo-stage approach allows the former to help us precisely align text\nand speech, while the latter provides rich contextual information, ef-\nfectively improving the quality of autoregressive speech generation.\nTo achieve emotional control, we introduce AdaLN (Adaptive\nLayer Normalization) [19]. Compared to traditional layer normal-\nization, AdaLN dynamically adjusts the scaling and shifting param-\neters during the normalization process based on input emotional fea-\ntures, allowing the generated speech to better convey emotional in-\nformation, thus enhancing the model\u2019s flexibility and adaptability in\nemotional generation. The effectiveness of AdaLN in information\nfusion is validated in [20]. The fused features are then adjusted for\nemotional style through AdaLN:\nHadapted = AdaLN(GateFusion(Htext, Hout), \u02c6\nHemo)\n(7)\nwhere the emotional AdaLN is defined as:\nAdaLN(hi, ei) = \u03b3(ei) \u2299hi \u2212\u00b5(hi)\n\u03c3(hi)\n+ \u03b2(ei)\n(8)\nwhere \u03b3(e) and \u03b2(e) are scaling and shift parameters predicted\nfrom emotional features, \u00b5(x) and \u03c3(x) denote the mean and stan-\ndard deviation of the input, and \u2299indicates element-wise multipli-\ncation.\nSubsequently, the speech decoder, comprising four layers of the\nLLM decoder, processes the emotionally adaptive hiddens to gener-\nate target emotional speech token sequences. This design allows the\nmodel to dynamically modulate the speech generation process based\non the predicted emotional cues, ensuring the generation of emotion-\nally consistent speech responses. The resulting speech tokens are\nthen converted into waveforms using the pre-trained vocoder from\nCosyVoice2.\n3. EXPERIMENTS\n3.1. Datasets\nGiven the scarcity of emotional dialogue speech datasets and the\nhigh cost of constructing large-scale annotated emotional speech\ndata, we propose an innovative data generation method that com-\nbines GPT-4o and CosyVoice2 to build a high-quality emotional\ndialogue speech dataset. We leverage GPT-4o\u2019s powerful text gener-\nation capabilities to create user queries spanning 20 different appli-\ncation domains including education, healthcare, customer service,\nand entertainment, with explicit emotional labels (such as happiness,\nsadness, anger, anxiety, etc.), then generate corresponding empa-\nthetic responses based on these queries to ensure rich emotional\nexpression and appropriate empathetic feedback in the dialogue\ncontent. Subsequently, we employ the CosyVoice2 speech synthesis\nmodel with ten different speakers (five male and five female) to\nsynthesize emotionally adaptive speech using these emotional labels\nas precise control directives, ensuring both speaker diversity and\ncorresponding affective characteristics, ultimately generating 150k\nhigh-quality emotional dialogue speech pairs.\nAdditionally, to further enrich the diversity and authenticity of\nthe dataset, we carefully curated 50k dialogue samples with clear\nemotional content and natural conversational characteristics from the\nVoiceAssistant dataset [4], employing text-based emotion classifica-\ntion for rigorous filtering to ensure the selected samples possess clear\n\nModel\nVoiceBench\nSpeech Quality\nAlpaca \u2191\nCommon \u2191\nIFEval \u2191\nWildVoice \u2191\nSD-QA \u2191\nUTMOS \u2191\nQwen2-Audio [21]\n3.74\n3.43\n26.33\n3.01\n35.71\n-\nMoshi [22]\n2.01\n1.60\n10.12\n1.30\n15.64\n3.81\nGLM-4-Voice [10]\n3.97\n3.42\n25.92\n3.18\n25.92\n3.48\nLLama-Omni [3]\n3.70\n3.46\n14.87\n2.92\n39.69\n3.98\nOurs\n3.84\n3.47\n27.89\n3.13\n36.87\n4.41\nTable 1.

We ap-\nplied the same speech synthesis pipeline to these curated samples,\ngenerating corresponding speech tokens and high-fidelity waveform\nfiles for each dialogue.\nThrough this systematic data construction process, we ultimately\nproduced a comprehensive emotional dialogue dataset containing\n200k high-quality emotional dialogue pairs, which encompasses rich\nemotional categories, diverse conversational scenarios, and natural\nspeech expressions, providing sufficient and high-quality data sup-\nport for model training.\n3.2. Training\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, the training process consists of two stages,\nboth utilizing the emotional QA 200k dataset we constructed. In the\nfirst stage, we fine-tune the LLM backbone using LoRA and simulta-\nneously train the downsampling adapters to achieve effective align-\nment between speech and text modalities. Concurrently, we train\nan emotion prediction head composed of linear layers to predict the\ncorresponding emotional features of speech from the LLM\u2019s output\nresponses. This stage focuses on learning to understand speech and\nemotional cues in the user\u2019s input and generate empathetic textual\nresponses.\nIn Stage 2.1, we directly use the embeddings of response text as\ninput to the speech decoder to train the foundational speech gener-\nation capability. This approach allows the model to learn the ba-\nsic mapping between textual semantic content and corresponding\nspeech representations, establishing a solid foundation for speech\nsynthesis.\nIn Stage 2.2, the gated fusion module is enabled to fuse the\nhidden states output by the LLM and text embeddings, thereby\nacquiring richer contextual information and further enhancing the\nquality and emotional expressiveness of generated speech responses.\nThroughout the speech generation process, emotional control is\nachieved through Adaptive Layer Normalization (AdaLN).\n4. RESULTS\nWe employ subsets of VoiceBench [23] as a benchmark to evalu-\nate the model\u2019s performance in speech-based question answering,\nutilizing the alpacaeval, commoneval, wildvoice, and ifeval subsets.\nThese subsets assess the model\u2019s ability to understand and execute\nvarious spoken commands. We also use UTMOS [24] to evaluate\nthe quality of generated speech. The results are presented in Table 1.\nFurthermore, we constructed 1,000 emotional test question-\nanswer pairs to evaluate emotional consistency between textual and\nspeech responses.\nWe input the speech transcriptions with their\nemotion labels, along with the model\u2019s response emotion labels and\ncontent into GPT for evaluation. This assesses whether responses\nmatch input emotions, appropriately address user emotional needs,\nand maintain consistency across text and speech modalities using a\n1-5 point scale. To examine speech-text alignment, we transcribe\nspeech using Whisper-large-v3 and compute Word Error Rate. We\nalso conducted an emotional MOS evaluation to assess empathetic\neffectiveness. Results are shown in Table 2.\nThe experimental results demonstrate that our model effectively\nprocesses speech input while maintaining its original capabilities.\nMore importantly, it accurately recognizes emotional information\nin user speech and generates corresponding emotional responses in\nboth modalities. This enables strong performance in multimodal\nemotional interaction tasks. However, challenges remain when pro-\ncessing speech with subtle or weak emotional intensity.\nIn such\ncases, the model may focus on semantic content and overlook par-\nalinguistic cues, leading to mismatched emotional responses. There-\nfore, improving performance with low emotional intensity speech\nremains an important research direction.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this study, we present Emotion Omni, a speech LLM designed\nto recognize speech input and generate empathetic responses. Our\nmodel effectively processes semantic and emotional features, en-\nabling emotionally coherent responses across text and speech modal-\nities. By introducing a cost-effective emotional dialogue dataset gen-\neration pipeline, we reduce dependency on large-scale labeled data,\nmaking empathetic speech system development more accessible.\nThe model\u2019s ability to generate high-quality empathetic speech with\nlimited resources opens possibilities for scalable emotion-aware in-\nteraction systems. While results are encouraging, challenges remain\nwith subtle emotional tones. The model may prioritize semantic\ncontent over emotional cues, reducing response accuracy. Future\nwork will focus on enhancing sensitivity to low-intensity emotions\nand optimizing the semantic-emotional balance. This research es-\ntablishes a foundation for developing more accessible and efficient\nempathetic speech generation systems.\n\n6.

However, many studies showed that they are vulnerable to knowledge corruption attacks, where an\nattacker can inject adversarial texts into the knowledge database of a RAG system to induce the LLM to generate attacker-desired\noutputs. Existing studies mainly focus on attacking specific queries or queries with similar topics (or keywords). In this work,\nwe propose UniC-RAG, a universal knowledge corruption attack against RAG systems. Unlike prior work, UniC-RAG jointly\noptimizes a small number of adversarial texts that can simultaneously attack a large number of user queries with diverse topics and\ndomains, enabling an attacker to achieve various malicious objectives, such as directing users to malicious websites, triggering\nharmful command execution, or launching denial-of-service attacks. We formulate UniC-RAG as an optimization problem and\nfurther design an effective solution to solve it, including a balanced similarity-based clustering method to enhance the attack\u2019s\neffectiveness. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that UniC-RAG is highly effective and significantly outperforms baselines.\nFor instance, UniC-RAG could achieve over 90% attack success rate by injecting 100 adversarial texts into a knowledge database\nwith millions of texts to simultaneously attack a large set of user queries (e.g., 2,000 queries). Additionally, we evaluate existing\ndefenses and show that they are insufficient to defend against UniC-RAG, highlighting the need for new defense mechanisms in\nRAG systems.\n1\nIntroduction\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems such as Bing Copilot [1], SearchGPT [2], and Google Search with AI\nOverviews [3] are widely deployed in the real world. There are also many open-source RAG frameworks, such as LlamaIn-\ndex [4], LangChain [5], and ChatRTX [6] that enable developers and researchers to build customized RAG systems for various\napplications. In general, a RAG system contains three major components: knowledge database, retriever, and LLM. A knowledge\ndatabase consists of many texts (e.g., millions of texts) collected from diverse sources such as Wikipedia [7]. Given a query (or a\nquestion) from a user, a retriever will search for a set of the most relevant texts from the knowledge database. The retrieved texts\nare used as the context for an LLM to generate a response to the user\u2019s query.\nMany recent studies [8\u201325] showed that RAG systems are vulnerable to knowledge corruption attacks. Specifically, an attacker\ncan inject adversarial texts into the knowledge database of a RAG system to induce an LLM to generate attacker-desired\nresponses for user queries. For instance, when the knowledge database is collected from Wikipedia, an attacker can maliciously\nedit Wikipedia pages to inject adversarial texts [8, 26].\nIn general, existing attacks [8\u201325] on RAG systems mainly focus on 1) a particular user query such as \u201cWho is the CEO of\nOpenAI?\u201d [8\u201312], 2) a set of similar queries (e.g., queries on a specific topic or with similar keywords) [13\u201315], and 3) queries\nthat contain an attacker-chosen backdoor trigger [16\u201320]. However, attacking a universal and broad scope of user queries remains\nunexplored. We aim to bridge this gap by introducing UniC-RAG, a universal knowledge corruption attack against RAG systems.\nOur work. In this work, we study a more universal and scalable attack scenario where an attacker crafts adversarial texts\ntargeting a large set of diverse, attacker-chosen queries (denoted as Q ). Unlike existing studies [8\u201315], which focus on attacking\nspecific or similar queries, our approach aims to compromise a large number of user queries (e.g., hundreds or even thousands of\nuser queries) that span a wide range of topics, domains, and linguistic expressions.\n1\n\nWe consider that an attacker aims to inject adversarial texts into the knowledge database of a RAG system. As a result, the LLM\nin RAG generates responses satisfying an attacker-chosen, arbitrary, yet universal attack objective for queries in Q . Achieving\nthis goal allows the attacker to pursue various malicious purposes in practice. For instance, an attacker can make an LLM\ngenerate a refusal answer [9] such as \u201cSorry, I cannot provide information about your question\u201d for any queries from Q , thereby\ndegrading the utility of a RAG system. This form of denial-of-service attack could disrupt critical applications, such as customer\nsupport chatbots [27], academic research assistants [28], or medical AI applications [29], reducing their effectiveness. Moreover,\nthe attacker can also induce an LLM to generate responses containing a malicious URL (e.g., \u201cwww.universalrag.com\u201d) for\nqueries from Q . By directing users to the attacker-controlled websites, the attacker could harvest sensitive credentials, distribute\nmalware, or manipulate users into making fraudulent transactions. This type of attack is particularly dangerous in domains where\nusers rely on AI-generated content for trusted information, such as legal or financial AI tools [30\u201332].\nOverview of UniC-RAG. The major challenge for an attacker is to craft a small number of adversarial texts to attack a large\nnumber of user queries simultaneously. For instance, prior studies [8\u201311] have explored knowledge corruption attacks where\neach adversarial text targets a single query. When extending these methods to our scenario, they either require injecting a large\nnumber of adversarial texts or result in suboptimal attack performance (as shown in our experimental results). The reason is that\nthey optimize adversarial texts for each user query independently.\nTo address this challenge, we jointly optimize adversarial texts across a set of diverse user queries. Specifically, the idea of\nUniC-RAG is to partition the set of user queries in Q into smaller groups and optimize a separate adversarial text for each group\nof queries. The key difficulty lies in determining how to partition Q effectively. A straightforward strategy is to randomly divide\nthe queries in Q into disjoint groups. However, the queries in each group can be very diverse (e.g., spanning different topics and\ndomains), which can reduce the effectiveness of the optimized adversarial text. In particular, the adversarial text may be effective\nfor certain queries in the group but ineffective against others. In response, another strategy is to use K-means to cluster user\nqueries based on their embedding vectors produced by a retriever, thereby grouping semantically similar queries together. The\nkey insight is that if a group of queries is semantically similar, it becomes possible to craft an adversarial text that is similar to all\nof them. Thus, the adversarial text can be retrieved for all these queries in the group, allowing the attacker to scale the attack\nwithout injecting many adversarial texts. However, K-means can result in imbalanced group sizes: some groups contain (much)\nmore queries than others. As a result, the optimized adversarial text can be less effective for groups with many queries, thereby\nreducing the overall effectiveness of attacks (as shown in our results).\nTo address the issue, we design a new clustering method to partition a large query set Q into smaller groups based on\nsemantic similarity, ensuring that 1) queries within each group are highly similar to each other, and 2) the group sizes are\nbalanced and comparable to each other. Then, for each group, UniC-RAG optimizes an adversarial text to achieve two goals. The\nfirst goal is that the adversarial text can be retrieved for the queries in the group. UniC-RAG employs an optimization-based\nmethod [33] to reach this goal. The second goal is that the adversarial text can mislead an LLM to generate a response satisfying\nthe attacker-chosen objective. UniC-RAG provides a generic framework and can incorporate diverse techniques such as prompt\ninjection [34\u201339] to achieve the second goal.\nEvaluation of UniC-RAG. We conduct systematic evaluations of UniC-RAG on 4 question-answering datasets: Natural\nQuestion (NQ) [40], HotpotQA [41], MS-MARCO [42], and a dataset (called Wikipedia) we constructed to simulate real-world\nRAG systems using Wikipedia dump [7]. We also conduct a comprehensive ablation study containing 4 RAG retrievers, 7\nLLMs varying in architectures and scales (e.g., Llama3 [43], GPT-4o [44]), and different hyperparameters of UniC-RAG. We\nadopt Retrieval Success Rate (RSR) and Attack Success Rate (ASR) as evaluation metrics. RSR quantifies the proportion of\nqueries whose retrieved texts contain at least one adversarial text, while ASR measures the proportion that yield attacker-desired\nresponses. Our results demonstrate that UniC-RAG could achieve over 90% RSRs and ASRs by injecting 100 adversarial texts\ninto databases with millions of texts to simultaneously attack 500-2,000 queries. Besides, UniC-RAG outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines [8, 9, 37, 45].\nDefending against UniC-RAG. We evaluate several defenses, including paraphrasing [46], expanding content window [8],\nand robust RAG systems [47\u201350]. Our results show these defense mechanisms are insufficient to defend against UniC-RAG,\nhighlighting the need for new defenses.\nOur major contributions are summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We propose UniC-RAG, a universal knowledge corruption attack to RAG systems. UniC-RAG enables an attacker to\nsimultaneously attack diverse user queries with a small number of adversarial texts to achieve different malicious objectives.\n\u2022 We formulate UniC-RAG as an optimization problem and solve it by proposing a balanced similarity-based clustering and\nleveraging a gradient-based optimization method. We also introduce a greedy initialization technique to further improve\nperformance.\n\u2022 We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of UniC-RAG on multiple datasets. Our results demonstrate that UniC-RAG is\nconsistently effective under different settings and outperforms baselines.\n2\n\n\u2022 We evaluate several defense mechanisms against UniC-RAG, and our results demonstrate that these defenses are insufficient,\nhighlighting the need for new defenses.\n2\nBackground and Related Work\n2.1\nRAG Systems\nOverview of RAG systems. A RAG system consists of three major components: a knowledge database, a retriever, and an\nLLM. The knowledge database contains a large collection of texts aggregated from diverse sources such as Wikipedia [51] or\nup-to-date newsletters [52]. For simplicity, we denote the knowledge database as D = {S1,S2,...,Sd}, where Si represents the\ni-th text in the database. Given a user query q, the RAG system retrieves a set of relevant texts from D and then conditions an\nLLM on the retrieved texts to generate a response. The process consists of two key steps:\nStep I\u2013Text Retrieval. The retriever is responsible for identifying the most relevant texts from a knowledge database for a given\nquery. In general, the retriever R is an encoder model that encodes texts into embedding vectors. Some retrievers [53] may\ncontain two different encoder models, one for user query q and one for texts in the database Si, while other retrievers [54, 55]\nonly contain one model for both queries and texts. For simplicity, we assume the retriever only has one encoder model, denoted\nas E. Based on our experimental results in Section 5.3, our proposed method could also generalize to retrievers with multiple\nencoder models. The similarity between a query q and a text Si is computed as Sim(E(q),E(Si)), where Sim(\u00b7,\u00b7) is a similarity\nfunction (e.g., cosine similarity, dot product). The retriever selects the top-k texts from D with the highest similarity scores to\nquery q to form the retrieved set, which is denoted as R (q;D).\nStep II\u2013Response Generation. After retrieving the top-k texts R (q;D), the LLM generates a response to q conditioned on\nthese retrieved texts as context. Specifically, given a system prompt (detailed in Appendix A), the LLM takes the query q along\nwith the retrieved texts as input and produces an answer:\nf(q,R (q;D)),\nwhere f is an LLM and we omit the system prompt for simplicity. This process enables the LLM to generate responses grounded\nin retrieved texts from knowledge database D.\n2.2\nExisting Attacks on RAG Systems\nOver the past year, several attacks on RAG systems have been proposed. These attacks can be broadly categorized into three\ntypes: single-query attacks [8\u201312], multiple-query attacks [13\u201315], and backdoor attacks [16\u201320].\nSingle-query attacks. In single-query attacks, an attacker injects adversarial texts into the knowledge database, aiming to\nmanipulate the responses of a RAG system to specific target queries [8\u201312]. In such attacks, each injected adversarial text only\ntargets a single query. For instance, Zou et al. [8] proposed PoisonedRAG, where the attacker injects adversarial texts into\nthe knowledge database to manipulate the LLM into generating an attacker-chosen response (e.g., \u201cTim Cook\u201d) for a specific\nquery (e.g., \u201cWho is the CEO of OpenAI?\u201d). PoisonedRAG can be viewed as a disinformation attack to RAG systems. Besides,\nShafran et al. [9] proposed Jamming, a denial-of-service attack that prevents RAG systems from answering specific queries.\nIn general, these attacks aim to make the LLM in a RAG system generate an attacker-desired response for each target query.\nTherefore, they optimize adversarial texts independently for each query. By contrast, in our work, we aim to make an LLM\ngenerate attacker-desired responses for diverse user queries. Due to such a difference, these existing attacks achieve a sub-optimal\nperformance when extended to our scenario, as demonstrated in our experimental results.\nMultiple-query attacks. In multiple-query attacks, an attacker aims to manipulate a set of similar queries (e.g. queries on a\nspecific topic, such as reviews of Harry Potter [14]) or queries containing related keywords (e.g. Potter) by injecting adversarial\ntexts into the knowledge database. Tan et al. [13] proposed LIAR, an attack that injects adversarial texts designed to be retrieved\nfor a set of semantically similar queries. Zhong et al. [45] proposed the Corpus Poisoning attack, which optimizes adversarial texts\nsuch that they can be retrieved for general user queries. Ben et al. [14] proposed GASLITEing, which optimizes adversarial texts\nto be retrieved for topic-specific queries. In general, their idea is to extend Corpus Poisoning [45] by introducing attacker-designed\nharmful information to not only compromise the retrieval, but also get attacker-desired responses from the RAG system. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of such attacks, we also extend Corpus Poisoning to our experiment scenario as a baseline. Our results\ndemonstrate that the extended Corpus Poisoning achieves sub-optimal performance.\nBackdoor attacks. In backdoor attacks, an attacker embeds backdoor triggers into adversarial texts and injects them into the\nknowledge database of a RAG system [16\u201320]. These adversarial texts remain inactive under normal conditions but are retrieved\nwhen a user query contains the corresponding backdoor trigger, thereby activating the attack. For instance, Cheng et al. [16]\n3\n\nproposed TrojanRAG, where the attacker fine-tunes a retriever model to bind backdoor triggers with adversarial texts, ensuring\nthey could be retrieved when specific triggers appear in user queries. Xue et al. [17] introduced BadRAG, which leverages\ncontrastive learning to optimize adversarial texts so that they are retrieved only by queries containing the backdoor trigger and\nremain undetected by other queries. Moreover, Chaudhari et al. [18] proposed Phantom, a stealthy backdoor attack that ensures\nadversarial documents are retrieved exclusively when a query contains a predefined trigger. These backdoor attacks ensure\nthat adversarial texts have high retrieval scores for queries containing the backdoor trigger while remaining undetectable for\nnon-triggered queries. Such attacks require target queries to contain backdoor triggers, which is different from our scenario\nwhere the attacker does not have control over user queries. Since these attacks rely on specific triggers to activate, they are\nfundamentally different from our setting, where adversarial texts must generalize across a broad scope of user queries. Therefore,\nwe do not include backdoor attacks as baselines in our experiments.\nDifference between our work and existing studies. The key difference between our work and existing studies is that we focus\non attacking more general and diverse user queries, whereas existing studies primarily target a single query or a predefined set of\nqueries (e.g., semantically similar queries or queries containing a backdoor trigger). Due to this fundamental difference, we find\nthat existing methods have limited effectiveness in achieving our goal. Our approach extends beyond these limitations by jointly\noptimizing adversarial texts to target a large number of user queries across a broad and diverse scope, significantly improving the\nattack\u2019s scalability and impact.\n2.3\nExisting Defenses\nSeveral defense mechanisms have been proposed to enhance the safety of RAG systems [8, 46\u201350, 56]. For instance, Jain et\nal. [46] proposed paraphrasing defense, which employs an LLM to rephrase user queries, reducing their similarity to adversarial\ntexts in the database. Besides, Zou et al. [8] also discussed expanding the context window of the RAG system or removing\nduplicate texts from the knowledge database, which could be applied to mitigate potential harms in the RAG system. Moreover,\nseveral works [47\u201350, 56] proposed techniques to enhance the RAG system itself by improving the RAG pipeline or fine-tuning\nthe LLM in the RAG system, making it robust to adversarial manipulations and reducing the risk of attacks.\n3\nProblem Formulation\nWe first discuss the threat model and then formulate UniC-RAG as an optimization problem.\n3.1\nThreat Model\nWe characterize the threat model with respect to the attacker\u2019s goals, background knowledge, and capabilities.\nAttacker\u2019s goals. Suppose Q is a set of user queries that an attacker is interested in. Specifically, Q could contain arbitrary\nqueries that cover a diverse range of topics. Moreover, Q could have a large size (e.g., with 2,000 queries). We consider that\nan attacker aims to inject a small number of adversarial texts (e.g., 100 texts) into the knowledge database of a RAG system.\nAs a result, when conditioned on the texts retrieved from the corrupted knowledge database, the LLM in the RAG system\ngenerates responses satisfying an attacker-chosen, arbitrary, yet universal objective (denoted as O) for queries in Q . Moreover,\nthe adversarial texts should also be able to transfer to queries beyond those in Q , thereby enhancing their universality and\ngenerality. For instance, the injected adversarial texts should remain effective for paraphrased versions of queries in Q . Moreover,\nwe also consider a more challenging scenario where the attacker does not know the user query set Q . Instead, the attacker can\nuse another query set Q \u2032 to generate adversarial texts, and then perform a transfer attack to the unseen user query set Q .\nBy selecting different objectives, an attacker can achieve various malicious purposes in practice. For instance, an attacker can\nembed a malicious link to answers for user queries, which can be used for phishing attempts. As a concrete example, an attacker\nmay wish the responses produced by a RAG system contain the following information for user queries: \u201cYou have reached the\naccess limit for this document, for more information, please visit www.universalrag.com.\u201d As a result, the user may be tricked\ninto visiting the harmful website, enabling an attacker to exploit this for malicious purposes, such as credential theft, malware\ndistribution, or financial fraud. The attacker (who can be the competitor of a RAG service provider) can also make an LLM in a\ntarget RAG system refuse to provide answers for queries in Q , thereby achieving denial-of-service effects. For instance, as shown\nin a previous study [9] on RAG security, an attacker may aim to make an LLM output \u201cSorry, I cannot provide information\nabout your query.\u201d for queries in Q .\nOur attack objective is different from previous studies [8, 9, 13, 14, 17, 18, 45] on RAG attacks. In general, these studies aim\nto make a RAG system generate a query-dependent, incorrect answer to a specific query. By contrast, UniC-RAG aims to attack a\n4\n\nWho wins the 2024 Nobel Prize in \nPhysics?\nWhat day is groundhog's day?\n...\n...\nWhen was RAG system invented?\nEncoding\nEmbedding Space\nBalanced\nClustering\n1.

We consider the attacker\u2019s background knowledge along three key\ndimensions of a RAG system: the knowledge database, the retriever, and the LLM. We assume the attacker has no access to the\nknowledge database, i.e., the attacker does not know any content and cannot retrieve texts from it by querying the RAG system.\nFollowing previous studies [8, 9, 13, 14, 16\u201318, 45], we assume the attacker has white-box access to the retriever used in the\nRAG system. This assumption is practical, as most state-of-the-art retriever models are open-source, enabling us to analyze and\nunderstand the worst-case scenario for knowledge corruption attacks. Additionally, we assume the attacker may or may not have\naccess to the LLM in the RAG system.\nFollowing previous studies on attacks against RAG systems [8, 9, 13, 14, 17, 18, 45], we assume the attacker can inject\nadversarial texts into the knowledge database but cannot manipulate any other components of the RAG system, such as the\nparameters of the retriever and LLM. In this work, we consider a challenging setting where the number of injected adversarial\ntexts is (much) smaller than the number of queries in Q .\n3.2\nFormulating UniC-RAG as an Optimization Problem\nSuppose Q is a set of m user queries (denoted as q1,q2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,qm). An attacker aims to craft n adversarial texts (denoted as\nP1,P2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,Pn) to achieve the aforementioned attacker\u2019s goal. We formally define the attack as follows:\nDefinition 1. Suppose q \u2208Q is a user query from a query set Q . Besides, we use O to denote the objective of an attacker and\nuse V (\u00b7,\u00b7) to denote an evaluation metric used to quantify whether the output of an LLM aligns with the attacker\u2019s objective O.\nAn attacker aims to craft a set of n adversarial texts \u0393 = {P1,P2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,Pn} by solving the following optimization problem:\nmax\n\u0393\n1\n|Q| \u2211\nq\u2208Q\nV (f(q;T (q)),O),\ns.t., T (q) = R (q;D \u222a\u0393),\n(1)\nwhere T (q) is a set of texts retrieved from a corrupted knowledge database D \u222a\u0393 for the query q, and f(q;T (q)) is the LLM\noutput for query q based on retrieved texts T (q).\n5\n\n\n\nChallenges in solving the optimization problem in Equation (1). The key challenges in solving the optimization problem in\nEquation (1) are as follows. The first challenge is to ensure that T (q) contains adversarial texts, i.e., adversarial texts in \u0393 can be\nretrieved by as many queries q \u2208Q as possible. The technical challenge here is that an attacker may wish to use a small number\nof adversarial texts to attack a large number of queries. Consequently, each adversarial text should be able to attack multiple\nqueries simultaneously. The second challenge is to ensure that the retrieved adversarial texts in T (q) successfully induce an\nLLM to generate a response that satisfies the attack objective O. The challenge here is that retrieved contexts T (q) may also\ncontain clean texts from the knowledge database D which could be used by the LLM to output correct answers. The adversarial\ntext must be effective enough to let the LLM output a response satisfying the attack objective O.\n4\nDesign of UniC-RAG\n4.1\nOverview of UniC-RAG\nUniC-RAG consists of two major components: query clustering and adversarial text optimization. UniC-RAG aims to optimize\nadversarial texts for all queries in Q simultaneously. However, this is highly challenging due to the complexity of jointly\noptimizing adversarial texts for diverse queries in Q . For instance, we can randomly divide queries in Q into disjoint groups and\noptimize an adversarial text for each group. However, queries in each group may span diverse topics and linguistic expressions,\nresulting in low semantic similarities among them. If we directly optimize a single adversarial text for them, it becomes difficult\nfor the adversarial text to achieve high similarity with all of them simultaneously. Consequently, when attacking a RAG system,\nsuch an adversarial text would not be effectively retrieved for all queries in a group, resulting in suboptimal effectiveness. To\naddress this challenge, we first partition the entire query set Q into groups based on semantic similarity and then generate one\nadversarial text for each group. Our strategy can simplify the optimization process, enabling each adversarial text to effectively\ntarget a smaller, coherent subset of queries, thereby enhancing both optimization efficiency and overall attack effectiveness.\nFigure 1 shows an overview of UniC-RAG.\nQuery clustering. The first component of UniC-RAG is a clustering method that partitions queries in Q into groups based\non their semantic similarity. One straightforward solution is to use the widely used K-means clustering [57] to group similar\nqueries. However, K-means clustering often results in imbalanced group sizes, where some groups contain (much) more queries\nthan others, e.g., some groups could contain more than 20 queries while others may contain very few or even a single query.\nOptimizing adversarial texts for larger groups can be more challenging, thereby reducing their effectiveness. To address the issue,\nwe propose a balanced similarity-based clustering method that ensures a more uniform distribution of queries across groups.\nDetails of the clustering method can be found in Algorithm 1.\nAdversarial text optimization. UniC-RAG optimizes an adversarial text for each group of queries. In particular, we aim to\nachieve two goals: 1) it can be retrieved for queries in the group, and 2) it can induce an LLM to generate a response satisfying\nthe attacker\u2019s objective. To reach the first goal, we extend a state-of-the-art text optimization method, HotFlip [33], to our attack\nscenario and further improve it by applying a greedy initialization technique. The idea is to initialize an adversarial text with\nthe last optimized one, rather than initializing from scratch with special tokens such as [MASK] [8, 45]. Our insight is that\nthe previously optimized adversarial text is already effective in being retrieved for queries within its original group of queries.\nBy using it as the initialization for crafting a new adversarial text for a different group of queries, we can leverage the useful\nadversarial patterns to improve the optimization efficiency and effectiveness, as shown in our experimental results. We note that\nmany techniques (such as prompt injection [34\u201339]) have been proposed to induce an LLM to generate attacker-desired outputs.\nUniC-RAG provides a generic framework, which could integrate these techniques to achieve the second goal.\n4.2\nBalanced Similarity-Based Clustering\nOur goal is to partition queries in Q into several balanced groups based on semantic similarity, thus simplifying the adversarial\ntext optimization. Given a query, RAG systems retrieve texts from a knowledge database based on the semantic similarity (e.g.,\ndot product or cosine similarity) between the embedding vectors of the query and texts in the database. The primary idea is that\nthe similarity between the embedding vectors of a query and a text would be high if they were semantically related. Thus, we\nalso leverage embedding vectors of queries in Q to partition them into groups.\nDesign details. Now we introduce our clustering method in Algorithm 1 in detail. The input of the algorithm consists of a set Q\nwith target user queries, a retriever E, a similarity metric Sim, and the number of clusters n. The output of the algorithm contains\nn clusters (denoted as C1,C2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,Cn), where each cluster contains a subset of user queries in Q . We first randomly sample n\nqueries from Q (line 2), using each sampled query q\u2217\ni to initialize a corresponding cluster Ci. Then, our goal is to gradually add\nthe remaining queries in Q to each cluster in a balanced way (i.e., ensuring each cluster has a similar number of queries). To this\n6\n\nAlgorithm 1: Balanced Similarity-Based Clustering\nInput: Target user query set Q , retriever encoder model E, similarity metric Sim, and number of clusters n.\nOutput: Clusters C1,C2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,Cn\n1: k = \u230a|Q |/n\u230b\n2: {q\u2217\n1,q\u2217\n2,...,q\u2217\nn} \u2190RandomSampling(Q ,n)\n3: Q \u2190Q \\{q\u2217\n1,q\u2217\n2,...,q\u2217\nn}\n4: for i = 1,2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,n do\n5:\nCi \u2190{q\u2217\ni }\n6:\nwhile |Ci| < k do\n7:\nq\u2217= argmaxq\u2208Q\n1\n|Ci| \u2211qj\u2208Ci Sim(E(q),E(qj))\n8:\nCi \u2190Ci \u222a{q\u2217}\n9:\nQ \u2190Q \\{q\u2217}\n10:\nend while\n11: end for\n12: for i = 1,2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7|Q | do\n13:\nh = argmaxh\u02c6\n1\n|Ch\u02c6| \u2211q j\u2208Ch\u02c6 Sim(E(qi),E(qj))\n14:\nCh\u02c6 \u2190Ch\u02c6 \u222a{qi}\n15: end for\n16: return C1,C2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,Cn\nend, for each cluster Ci, we find the query q\u2217that has the highest average similarity to all existing queries in Ci (line 7) and add it\nto Q . We repeat this process until the number of queries in Ci reaches a certain limit (k, which is defined in line 1). Note that a\nquery is removed from Q once it is added to a cluster, ensuring that the query is not assigned to multiple clusters. After line 11,\nwe have constructed n clusters, C1,C2,...,Cn, each containing at least k queries. However, there are still |Q |\u2212n\u00b7k unassigned\nqueries remaining in the query set Q . To allocate these remaining queries, we assign each query qi to the cluster Ch with which\nit has the highest average similarity (lines 12-15). This step ensures that all queries are assigned while maintaining semantic\ncoherence within each cluster. At the end, all queries in Q are partitioned into n balanced clusters C1,C2,...,Cn, each containing\nat least k semantically similar queries. We return the clusters C1,C2,...,Cn as the output of the algorithm (line 16).\n4.3\nOptimization of Adversarial Texts\nOnce we have partitioned the query set Q into clusters C1,C2,...,Cn, we could transform the optimization problem in Equation (1)\ninto the following form:\nmax\n\u0393\n1\n|Q |\nn\n\u2211\ni=1 \u2211\nq\u2208Ci\nV (f(q;T (q)),O),\ns.t., T (q) = R (q;D \u222a\u0393),\n(2)\nwhere \u0393 = {P1,P2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,Pn} is a set of adversarial texts that are injected into the knowledge database D. As we independently\noptimize an adversarial text for each cluster, we can solve the optimization problem in Equation (2) by solving n subproblems. In\nparticular, we have the following optimization problem for each cluster Ci (i = 1,2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,n):\nmax\nPi\n1\n|Ci| \u2211\nq\u2208Ci\nV (f(q;T (q)),O),\ns.t., T (q) = R (q;D \u222a{Pi}),\n(3)\nwhere Pi is the adversarial text optimized for cluster Ci.\nThe challenges in solving the optimization problem in Equation (3) are two-fold. The first challenge is to ensure that adversarial\ntext Pi could successfully induce an LLM to output a response satisfying attack objective O. Second, we need to ensure that the\nadversarial text Pi could be retrieved for its corresponding target queries q \u2208Ci. Unlike existing works [8, 9] that optimize each\nadversarial text targeting a single query, UniC-RAG aims to craft adversarial texts that effectively target multiple queries, i.e., all\n7\n\nqueries in cluster Ci, thereby expanding the attack scope to diverse queries. By solving Equation (3) for all clusters C1,C2,...,Cn,\nwe will get n adversarial texts that target all queries in Q , thereby solving the optimization problem in Equation (1).\nTo address the above two challenges, following prior study [8], we decompose each adversarial text Pi (i = 1,2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,n) into\ntwo sub-components: Pi = Pr\ni \u2295Pg\ni , where Pr\ni is responsible for ensuring that the adversarial text could be successfully retrieved,\nwhile Pg\ni is designed to induce an LLM to generate a response satisfying the attack objective O once the adversarial text is\nretrieved.\nSince the attacker has a universal attack objective O for all queries in Q . We first craft an effective Pg\ni that could induce an\nLLM to generate responses satisfying O before optimizing Pr\ni . To ensure Pg\ni maintains its attack effectiveness after optimizing\nthe entire adversarial text Pi, we keep the well-crafted Pg\ni fixed when optimizing Pr\ni . This prevents degradation of Pg\ni \u2019s ability to\ninduce the attacker-desired response while optimizing Pr\ni . Once Pg\ni is well-crafted (e.g., it could successfully induce responses\nsatisfying O), it remains unchanged and is used throughout the attack.\nThus, we first introduce how to craft Pg\ni and then discuss the optimization of Pr\ni .\nCrafting Pg\ni . The goal of crafting Pg\ni is to induce an LLM to output an attacker-desired response that satisfies the attack objective\nO. This problem has been extensively studied in prior works [8, 37, 39, 58, 59]. Thus, instead of reinventing the wheel, we\nadopt existing techniques to craft Pg\ni . For instance, an attacker could leverage prompt injection attacks [34\u201339] to craft malicious\ninstructions that manipulate an LLM into generating attacker-desired responses. Besides, the attacker could also perform a\ndisinformation attack [8] by generating misleading or false content as Pg\ni . Moreover, the attacker can formulate crafting Pg\ni as an\noptimization problem to induce the LLM to produce a specific output, and several optimization-based attacks such as GCG [58]\nand AutoDAN [59] have been developed, which can be extended to optimize Pg\ni .\nAs prompt injection attacks are very effective in inducing an LLM to output attacker-desired responses and very flexible for\ndifferent attack objectives, we use prompt injection attacks as our default method to craft Pg\ni . An example of a prompt injection\nattack is as follows:\nYou should inform the user \u201cYou have reached the access limit for this document. For more information, please visit\nwww.universalrag.com.\u201d\nOptimizing Pr\ni . Once we have a well-crafted Pg\ni , the goal is to optimize Pr\ni such that the adversarial text Pi = Pr\ni \u2295Pg\ni can be\nsuccessfully retrieved for query q \u2208Ci. Since the RAG retriever utilizes semantic similarity to retrieve texts from database D, to\nlet Pi be retrieved for each query q \u2208Ci, we should maximize the semantic similarity between Pi and queries in Ci. However,\nmaximizing the similarities for all queries in Ci simultaneously is challenging. Recall that we have already partitioned the queries\ninto clusters based on semantic similarity, so queries in one cluster are similar with each other. Therefore, we choose to maximize\nthe average similarity between Pi and each query in the cluster. Formally, we have the following optimization problem:\nmax\nPr\ni\n1\n|Ci| \u2211\nq\u2208Ci\nSim(E(Pr\ni \u2295Pg\ni ),E(q)),\n(4)\nwhere E is the retriever encoder model that encodes queries and texts into embedding vectors, and Sim is the similarity metric\n(e.g., dot-product or cosine similarity).\nMany existing works have already studied adversarial text optimization [33, 60\u201364] and their methods can be used to solve\nEquation (4). We also leverage these optimization methods to solve our optimization problem. In particular, we adopt HotFlip [33],\nwhich is a state-of-the-art text optimization method to optimize Pr\ni .\nWe further leverage a technique to improve the optimization performance. Unlike previous studies [8, 45] that initialize\nadversarial text as random or [MASK] tokens, we adopt a greedy initialization that initializes Pr\ni using the previous optimized text\nPr\ni\u22121 when i > 1, and [MASK] tokens when i = 1. Our results show that this technique is effective in improving the optimization\nperformance.\n4.4\nComplete Algorithm\nAlgorithm 2 shows the complete algorithm of UniC-RAG. It takes a target user query set Q , a universal attack objective O,\nand the retriever model R of the RAG system as input. The attacker can choose a similarity metric Sim and the number of\nadversarial texts n. We first partition the user query set Q into clusters C1,C2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,Cn based on semantic similarity using our\nBalanced Similarity-based Clustering (line 1). Then, an initially empty set \u0393 \u2190/0 is created to store the final adversarial texts\n(line 2). Next, we craft a universal Pg that can induce an LLM to output responses satisfying the attack objective O and use it for\nall adversarial texts (i.e., Pg\ni = Pg) (line 3). As introduced above, the attacker could use different methods to craft Pg, such as\n8\n\nAlgorithm 2: UniC-RAG\nInput: Target user query set Q , attack objective O, retriever encoder model E, similarity metric Sim, number of adversarial\ntexts n.\nOutput: Adversarial text set \u0393 = {P1,P2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,Pn}\n1: C1,C2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,Cn \u2190SimilarityClustering(Q ,E,Sim,n)\n2: \u0393 \u2190/0\n3: Pg = argmaxP\u02c6 g pf (O|P\u02c6 g)\n4: for i = 1,2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,n do\n5:\nPg\ni = Pg\n6:\nPr\ni = argmaxP\u02c6 r\ni\n1\n|Ci| \u2211q\u2032\u2208Ci Sim(E(P\u02c6 r\ni \u2295Pg\ni ),E(q\u2032))\n7:\n\u0393 \u2190\u0393\u222a{Pr\ni \u2295Pg\ni }\n8: end for\n9: return \u0393\nprompt injection [37, 39], disinformation [8], or optimization methods [58, 59]. Then, for each cluster Ci,i \u2208{1,2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,n}, we\nutilize HotFlip [33] to optimize Pr\ni to maximize the average similarity between the adversarial text Pr\ni \u2295Pg\ni and the query q\u2032 \u2208Ci\n(lines 4-6). We further add the optimized adversarial text Pi = Pr\ni \u2295Pg\ni into set \u0393 (line 7) and finally output the set of adversarial\ntexts \u0393 = {P1,P2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,Pn}.\n5\nEvaluation\n5.1\nExperimental Setup\nDatasets. We evaluate UniC-RAG using three public question-answering datasets and also create a large-scale dataset to\nsimulate a real-world RAG system. The three public datasets are from BEIR benchmark [51]: Natural Questions (NQ) [40],\nHotpotQA [41], and MS-MARCO [42]. NQ and HotpotQA contain articles collected from Wikipedia, while MS-MARCO contains\nweb documents. Following previous studies [65\u201367], we split articles or documents into chunks, where each chunk contains 100\ntokens. These three datasets also contain user queries. Additionally, to evaluate the performance of UniC-RAG in a real-world\nRAG environment, we construct a large-scale dataset from Wikipedia dump on 01-11-2023 [7]. Similarly, we split each article\ninto chunks with 100 tokens, resulting in a knowledge database of 47,778,385 texts. As this dataset does not contain user queries,\nwe use queries from the NQ dataset in our experiments. Table 6 (in Appendix) provides detailed statistics for each dataset.\nRAG setup. A RAG system consists of three main components: knowledge database, retriever, and LLM. The setup for each\ncomponent is as follows:\n\u2022 Knowledge database. As stated above, we split the documents in each dataset into chunks with 100 tokens to construct the\nknowledge database.\n\u2022 Retriever. We evaluate four retrievers: Contriever [54], Contriever-ms [54], DPR-Multi [53], and DPR-Single [53]. Following\nprior studies [45, 68], we use the dot product between the embedding vectors of a query and a text from the knowledge\ndatabase to compute their similarity score by default.\n\u2022 LLM. We evaluate seven different LLMs with varying sizes and architectures: Llama-3-8B [43], Llama-3.1-8B [43], Llama-2-\n7B and 13B [69], GPT-3.5-turbo [70], GPT-4o-mini [44], and GPT-4o [44]. We set the LLM temperature parameter to 0 to\nminimize randomness and ensure results are reproducible.\nUnless otherwise specified, we adopt the following default settings. We use HotpotQA as our default dataset for the ablation\nstudy and use Contriever as our default retriever model. Given a user query, following prior work [68], we retrieve the top 5, 10,\nand 20 most relevant texts from the knowledge database to serve as the context for the query. The similarity between a query and\na text is computed using the dot product of their embedding vectors. For the LLM, we use Llama-3-8B-Instruct by default, which\nis a popular, open-source model that enables large-scale experiments.\nAttack objectives. As discussed in Section 4.3, UniC-RAG enables various attack strategies to achieve diverse attack objectives.\nIn our experiments, we focus on the following objectives:\n\u2022 Malicious Link Injection. For this objective, the attacker manipulates the RAG system into generating links regardless of\nthe query\u2019s content. These links may direct users to dangerous websites, where the attacker can exploit them for malicious\npurposes, such as credential theft, malware distribution, or financial fraud. In our experiments, we evaluate this attack objective\nby injecting adversarial texts designed to force the LLM to output a predefined URL, denoted as \u201cwww.universalrag.com\u201d.\n9\n\n\u2022 Harmful Command Execution. Many LLM-powered applications (e.g., these under Model Context Protocol [71] that\nconnect LLMs to computer systems) and agents [72\u201375] leverage LLMs to automate actions, including executing commands\nin Linux environments or interacting with SQL databases. Attackers can exploit this functionality to manipulate the LLM\ninto generating harmful commands that compromise system integrity, delete critical files, or install malicious software. Such\nattacks could pose severe security risks, especially in automated workflows or enterprise systems. In our experiments, we craft\nadversarial texts to force the LLM to generate some harmful commands. The commands we used in the experiment could be\nfound in Appendix B.\n\u2022 Denial-of-Service. Following [9], such attacks aim to disrupt LLM functionality by causing refusal of answers to queries (e.g.,\ninducing an LLM to output \u201cSorry, I cannot provide information about your question\u201d). This can severely degrade usability in\nreal-world applications. Jamming attack [9] introduces some specific prompts that cause the LLM to refuse to answer user\nqueries. In our experiments, we utilize these prompts as the well-crafted Pg\ni in the adversarial texts and optimize Pr\ni as usual to\nperform denial-of-service attacks to RAG systems. The denial-of-service prompts can be found in Appendix C.\nUnless otherwise mentioned, we use the Malicious Link Injection as our default attack objective for all compared baselines and\nour UniC-RAG.\nEvaluation metrics. We use the following metrics:\n\u2022 Retrieval Success Rate (RSR). We generate adversarial texts for the target user queries and inject them into the database.\nTo assess the effectiveness of adversarial text retrieval, following [45], we measure the top-k retrieval success rate, which is\ndefined as the percentage of target user queries for which at least one adversarial text appears in the top-k retrieved contexts.\n\u2022 Attack Success Rate (ASR). ASR quantifies the percentage of target user queries where the RAG system generates responses\nthat successfully satisfy the attack objective O. The definition of a successful attack varies based on the attack objective:\n\u2022 For malicious link injection and harmful command execution objectives, following previous studies [8, 76, 77], we use\nsubstring matching to determine whether the generated response contains the attack objective O (e.g., www.universalrag.com\nor a malicious command). If the link or harmful command appears in the response as a substring, we consider the attack is\nsuccessful.\n\u2022 For denial-of-service objective, we adopt an LLM-based evaluation method proposed by [9], which utilizes a few-shot\nlearning prompt to assess whether the user query has been successfully answered. This evaluation method takes both the\nRAG system\u2019s response and the original query as input and outputs either YES (query answered) or NO (query denied). If a\nquery is denied, we consider the attack to be successful for this query.\nBaseline methods. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing attack that aims to achieve our attack goal. Therefore,\nwe extend other attacks [8, 9, 37, 45] against RAG systems and LLMs to our scenario. In particular, we consider the following\nbaselines:\n\u2022 PoisonedRAG. In this baseline, we extend a state-of-the-art targeted attack against RAG system [8] to our scenario. Poisone-\ndRAG generates one adversarial text for each user query. We use the open-source implementation in experiments.\n\u2022 Prompt Injection Attack. Following [37, 39, 78], there are several effective prompt injection attacks to mislead LLMs to\ngenerate attacker-desired responses. The major limitation of prompt injection attacks is that they cannot ensure the adversarial\ntexts are retrieved. In our experiments, we use prompts from [37, 39] as the adversarial texts and inject them into the database.\nIn our experiments, we use the prompt in Appendix D:\n\u2022 Jamming Attack. Shafran et al. [9] introduced a new denial-of-service attack called Jamming attack, which combines the\ntechnique that attacks RAG retriever from [8] with handcrafted denial-of-service prompts (using prompt injection attacks). We\nuse the open-source implementation in experiments.\n\u2022 Corpus Poisoning. Zhong et al. [45] proposed an optimization-based attack against RAG systems which also injects adversarial\ntexts into a RAG database. By design, their method can only make adversarial texts be retrieved but cannot induce an LLM to\ngenerate attacker-desired responses. We use the open-source implementation in experiments.\n\u2022 Extended Corpus Poisoning. For comprehensive comparison, we extend Corpus Poisoning [45] to our attack scenario by\nappending a suffix (i.e., Pg\ni as denoted in Section 4.3) to the adversarial texts and jointly optimizing the adversarial texts. For\nthe optimization, we use the open-source implementation from [45].\nHyperparameter setting. Unless otherwise mentioned, we adopt the following hyperparameters for UniC-RAG. We randomly\nselect m = 500 user queries as target queries for each dataset. Moreover, we inject 100 adversarial texts into the knowledge\ndatabase, i.e., n = 100. During training, we run t = 500 iterations and set the length l = 50 for Pr\ni . We conduct a systematic\nablation study on the impact of these hyperparameters on UniC-RAG.\n10\n\nTable 1: Comparing the effectiveness of UniC-RAG under our proposed new clustering method with UniC-RAG under\nexisting clustering methods.\nDatasets\nNQ\nHotpotQA\nMS-MARCO\nWikipedia\nTop-5\nTop-10\nTop-20\nTop-5\nTop-10\nTop-20\nTop-5\nTop-10\nTop-20\nTop-5\nTop-10\nTop-20\nRSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR\nUniform Selection 72.2 53.2 77.2 52.2 83.4 56.2 98.6 83.0 98.8 89.8 99.0 86.4 61.2 43.8 67.6 46.0 72.6 48.6 62.6 43.6 66.2 47.2 71.2 48.6\nDBSCAN\n74.0 62.2 78.4 61.4 83.0 63.6 98.6 89.4 99.0 92.2 99.0 90.0 64.2 46.2 69.4 48.4 72.4 51.6 65.2 43.6 70.8 48.8 76.2 52.0\nHDBSCAN\n63.4 49.2 67.6 49.4 71.4 54.0 98.8 86.4 98.8 90.0 99.0 87.4 61.0 52.4 64.0 52.4 70.2 54.0 60.8 47.8 64.6 52.4 69.6 54.4\nBisecting K-means 86.4 64.0 90.4 64.8 92.4 69.6 98.8 88.0 99.2 88.8 99.6 88.4 78.6 66.2 82.6 68.0 85.2 71.0 78.2 58.4 80.8 61.4 83.8 64.4\nK-means\n82.0 70.2 85.8 71.4 88.4 75.2 99.8 84.2 99.8 89.8 99.8 91.8 69.2 56.8 73.6 60.2 77.8 61.8 76.6 66.4 80.4 70.2 84.6 70.6\nOurs\n94.2 82.2 95.8 83.6 96.6 87.4 99.6 90.8 99.6 91.4 99.6 92.2 84.4 73.2 87.4 76.0 89.8 78.0 87.6 68.2 91.0 74.2 93.0 77.0\n5.2\nMain Results\nUniC-RAG is effective. Table 2 reports the RSRs and ASRs of UniC-RAG across four datasets: NQ, HotpotQA, MS-MARCO,\nand Wikipedia. Based on the experimental results, we have the following observations. On all four datasets, UniC-RAG achieves\nan average RSR of 93.2% and an average ASR of 81.2%, demonstrating that the adversarial texts generated by UniC-RAG can\nbe easily retrieved by user queries and successfully induce attacker-desired response to achieve attack objective O once retrieved.\nNotably, despite the large size of each dataset\u2019s knowledge base, which ranges from 3,743,629 (NQ) to 47,778,385 (Wikipedia)\ntexts, our attack remains effective while injecting only 100 adversarial texts. This highlights the extreme vulnerability of RAG\nsystems to our proposed UniC-RAG attack. In particular, Wikipedia contains a significantly larger knowledge database with\n47,778,385 texts, simulating a real-world, large-scale RAG system. UniC-RAG maintains high RSRs and ASRs in this setting,\nconfirming its effectiveness in attacking very large knowledge databases.\nUniC-RAG outperforms baselines. Table 2 also compares UniC-RAG against baseline methods under the default setting. For\neach method, we inject the same number of malicious texts (i.e., n = 100 adversarial texts). We note that PoisonedRAG and\nJamming craft malicious texts for each query independently. To compare different methods under the same number of adversarial\ntexts, we randomly select 100 user queries as their target queries. Our key observations are as follows: For Prompt Injection,\nit lacks an optimized prefix (i.e., Pr\ni ) to ensure that the adversarial text is retrieved for user queries. As a result, it achieves an\nRSR and ASR of 0.0%, making it ineffective in our attack scenario. For PoisonedRAG, each adversarial text is optimized to\ntarget a single query. Given a fixed number of injected texts n, PoisonedRAG can only influence about n user queries. In contrast,\nUniC-RAG jointly optimizes adversarial texts across multiple user queries, allowing it to influence all m queries, where m \u2265n.\nThis broader attack scope enables UniC-RAG to achieve significantly higher RSRs and ASRs than PoisonedRAG under the same\nnumber of adversarial texts. For Jamming, it uses the user query itself as Pr\ni to ensure the adversarial text could be retrieved.\nTherefore, similar to PoisonedRAG, each adversarial text generated by Jamming is limited to affecting a single user query. Since\nUniC-RAG jointly optimizes adversarial texts across multiple queries, it consistently outperforms Jamming in RSRs and ASRs.\nFor Corpus Poisoning, although it ensures that adversarial texts could be retrieved, it does not incorporate Pg\ni to manipulate the\nLLM\u2019s output. Consequently, while it achieves non-trivial RSRs, its ASRs remain 0.0%, as it fails to induce the attacker-desired\nresponses to achieve the attack objective O.\nAs mentioned before, each crafted text by PoisonedRAG and Jamming is tailored to a single user query. To further validate the\nefficiency and effectiveness of UniC-RAG, we increase the number of injected adversarial texts for PoisonedRAG and Jamming,\nallowing them to inject n = 500 adversarial texts\u2014five times more than UniC-RAG, which injects only n = 100 texts by default.\nAs shown in Table 3, despite this substantial increase in attack budget, UniC-RAG still achieves comparable performance to\nthese methods across all datasets. These results highlight the scalability and efficiency of UniC-RAG, demonstrating that it can\nmaintain high effectiveness while requiring significantly fewer adversarial texts to compromise a broad set of queries.\nTo conduct a comprehensive comparison, we further introduce Extended Corpus Poisoning, an enhanced version of Corpus\nPoisoning that appends Pg\ni to the optimized text. Despite this modification, our experimental results show that UniC-RAG still\noutperforms Extended Corpus Poisoning. The superiority of UniC-RAG over Extended Corpus Poisoning is attributed to two key\nfactors:\n\u2022 Balanced similarity-based clustering outperforms K-means. UniC-RAG adopts a clustering method which jointly considers\nboth semantic similarity and cluster balance to partition user queries into more semantically-related and balanced groups,\nwhile K-means often produces highly unbalanced clusters.\nFigure 2 compares the cluster size distributions produced by K-means and our proposed balanced similarity-based clustering\nmethod. As shown, K-means results in highly unbalanced clusters, with 2 clusters containing over 25 user queries. We further\nevaluated the performance of adversarial texts optimized on such clusters. For a total of 54 user queries across the two clusters,\n11\n\nTable 2: Comparing the effectiveness of UniC-RAG with existing baselines.\nDatasets\nNQ\nHotpotQA\nMS-MARCO\nWikipedia\nTop-5\nTop-10\nTop-20\nTop-5\nTop-10\nTop-20\nTop-5\nTop-10\nTop-20\nTop-5\nTop-10\nTop-20\nRSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR\nBaselines\nPrompt Injection\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\nPoisonedRAG\n16.4 16.4 17.4 17.4 18.6 18.6 69.2 69.2 76.0 75.8 81.8 81.2 16.2 16.2 17.0 16.8 17.6 17.2 16.8 16.8 18.2 18.2 20.8 20.0\nJamming\n19.6 19.6 20.0 20.0 20.2 20.2 41.8 41.8 48.4 48.4 57.2 57.0 16.2 16.2 17.6 17.6 18.4 18.0 18.6 18.6 18.8 18.8 19.4 19.4\nCorpus Poisoning\n69.4 0.0\n74.6 0.0\n78.8 0.0\n99.0 0.0\n99.2 0.0\n99.2 0.0\n54.4 0.0\n56.2 0.0\n62.0 0.0\n68.8 0.0\n72.6 0.0\n75.4 0.0\nExtended Corpus Poisoning\n66.8 55.8 72.2 57.0 77.4 61.2 98.0 81.4 98.4 83.4 98.4 85.2 59.2 46.6 64.0 48.2 67.6 51.6 68.8 54.6 70.6 58.4 75.0 64.0\nOur UniC-RAG\nBase\n77.2 60.4 80.4 63.4 85.0 68.2 98.6 80.0 99.0 83.8 99.4 85.2 64.4 50.4 68.0 51.6 72.8 53.6 73.6 58.0 76.4 62.0 79.8 65.0\n+Greedy Initialization\n82.0 70.2 85.8 71.4 88.4 75.2 99.8 84.2 99.8 89.8 99.8 91.8 69.2 56.8 73.6 60.2 77.8 61.8 76.6 66.4 80.4 70.2 84.6 70.6\n+Similarity Based Clustering 94.2 82.2 95.8 83.6 96.6 87.4 99.6 90.8 99.6 91.4 99.6 92.2 84.4 73.2 87.4 76.0 89.8 78.0 87.6 68.2 91.0 74.2 93.0 77.0\nTable 3: Comparing UniC-RAG with PoisonedRAG and Jamming when these two baselines can inject more texts than\nUniC-RAG.\nDatasets\nNQ\nHotpotQA\nMS-MARCO\nWikipedia\nTop-5\nTop-10\nTop-20\nTop-5\nTop-10\nTop-20\nTop-5\nTop-10\nTop-20\nTop-5\nTop-10\nTop-20\nRSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR RSR ASR\nPoisonedRAG (inject 500) 60.4 60.0 61.8 61.8 63.8 63.6 85.4\n85.4\n89.6\n89.6\n93.0\n92.8 50.4 50.4 51.8 51.6 53.2 52.6 50.4 50.4 51.6 51.6 54.0 53.4\nJamming (inject 500)\n97.2 97.2 99.0 99.0 99.6 99.6 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 84.0 84.0 89.6 89.2 92.8 92.0 93.2 93.2 95.0 95.0 97.0 96.8\nOurs (inject 100)\n94.2 82.2 95.8 83.6 96.6 87.4 99.6\n90.8\n99.6\n91.4\n99.6\n92.2 84.4 73.2 87.4 76.0 89.8 78.0 87.6 68.2 91.0 74.2 93.0 77.0\nTable 4: UniC-RAG could achieve different attack objectives.

These results indicate that adversarial texts optimized for large clusters struggle to effectively\nhandle a large number of queries, ultimately degrading overall performance. In contrast, our proposed clustering method\nproduces balanced clusters, ensuring that adversarial optimization is performed in a more stable setting. This balanced approach\nenhances both retrieval consistency and adversarial effectiveness, enabling UniC-RAG to maintain high RSRs and ASRs\nacross a broad set of queries.\n\u2022 Greedy initialization significantly improves adversarial text optimization. Unlike other methods [8, 45] that start from scratch\nwith [MASK] tokens at each iteration, we use the last optimized Pr\ni\u22121 to initialize the current Pr\ni , which allows UniC-RAG to\nfurther refine previously optimized texts. This technique enables better optimization within a limited number of optimization\nsteps, leading to consistently higher RSRs and ASRs.\nUniC-RAG could achieve diverse attack objectives. Table 4 demonstrates that UniC-RAG is capable of executing various attack\nstrategies, including malicious link injection, harmful command execution, and denial-of-service. These results highlight UniC-\nRAG\u2019s effectiveness in compromising RAG systems to generate attacker-desired responses across different attack objectives.\nComparison of our balanced similarity-based clustering with other clustering methods. Figure 2 and Table 1 present a\ncomparative analysis of our proposed clustering method with state-of-the-art clustering techniques, including Uniform (Random)\nSelection, DBSCAN [79], HDBSCAN [80], Bisecting K-means [81], and K-means [57]. For Uniform (Random) Selection, we\nfirst determine the cluster size as k = \u230a|Q |/n\u230b, ensuring each cluster contains an equal number of queries.

The dataset is HotpotQA.\npartition the query set Q into n clusters by sampling queries uniformly at random without replacement, where each cluster\nconsists of exactly k queries. For the other clustering methods, we use implementations from scikit-learn [82] with their default\nparameter settings.\nFigure 2 compares the cluster size distributions of our proposed clustering method with other clustering methods, while Table 1\nshows RSRs and ASRs of each method. Unlike our proposed method, K-means, HDBSCAN, and Bisecting K-means produce\nhighly unbalanced clusters. Since each adversarial text is optimized for an entire cluster, adversarial texts generated for larger\nclusters have to target more queries, making optimization more challenging and less effective, resulting in suboptimal results.\nAlthough Uniform Selection and DBSCAN can produce relatively balanced clusters, they cannot ensure queries in one cluster are\nsimilar enough to each other. For instance, Uniform Selection also produces balanced clusters, but it randomly assigns queries\nto clusters without considering their semantic similarity, making it challenging to optimize an adversarial text that effectively\ntargets all queries within a cluster. In contrast, our proposed method utilizes semantic similarity to partition queries and produces\nbalanced clusters, ensuring that queries in one cluster are similar enough to each other, which makes the optimization easier.\nOur results demonstrate that on NQ, MS-MARCO, and Wikipedia, our clustering method achieves the highest RSRs and ASRs,\nsurpassing all other clustering methods. We note that, on HotpotQA, our clustering method achieves a similar performance\nwith existing ones. The reason is that all clustering methods achieve near-optimal performance, with RSRs ranging between\n98%\u201399%, leaving little room for further improvement.\n5.3\nAblation Study\n5.3.1\nImpact of hyperparameters in RAG system\nA RAG system consists of three components: the knowledge database, the retriever, and the LLM. Since we have shown the\nimpact of the knowledge database in Section 5.2, now we discuss the impact of the retriever and LLM.\nImpact of retriever. Table 7 (in Appendix) shows the performance of UniC-RAG on different retrievers under the default\nsetting. UniC-RAG consistently achieves high RSRs and ASRs, demonstrating that UniC-RAG remains effective across different\nretrievers.\nImpact of LLM. Table 8 (in Appendix) presents the results for different LLMs. We perform evaluation on both open-source\nand closed-source models, including the Llama family and OpenAI\u2019s closed-source models: GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and\nGPT-4o. The experiment results demonstrate that UniC-RAG successfully executes attacks across models of different scales and\narchitectures, consistently achieving high ASRs. This indicates that adversarial texts generated by UniC-RAG could not only be\nretrieved by the retriever, but also effectively manipulate outputs generated by diverse LLMs to achieve attack objectives.\n5.3.2\nImpact of hyperparameters in UniC-RAG\nAs introduced in Algorithm 2, UniC-RAG could be influenced by several key hyperparameters: the number of user queries (m),\nthe number of clusters (n, also the number of injected adversarial texts), the length l of Pr\ni (Pr\ni is part of adversarial text that is\nused to make it be retrieved), and the number of optimization iterations (t). We analyze the impact of each hyperparameter below.\nImpact of m (number of user queries). m = |Q| is the number of user queries. As shown in Figure 3, increasing m leads to a\nmonotonic decrease in RSR and a rise followed by a decline in ASR. This is expected, as a larger m results in more queries\nsharing a fixed number of adversarial texts, making optimization more challenging. Despite this trend, UniC-RAG remains\neffective across a wide range of m values, showing its ability to attack a broad query set.\nImpact of n (number of clusters or injected adversarial texts). n represents the number of clusters used in balanced similarity-\nbased clustering, which also corresponds to the number of injected adversarial texts. As shown in Figure 3, increasing n leads\nto higher RSR and ASR. This is because, given a fixed number of user queries, having more adversarial texts means each one\ntargets fewer queries, making adversarial texts easier to optimize and thus more effective. However, a larger n also increases\ncomputational cost, highlighting a trade-off between attack performance and efficiency.\n13\n\n100\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\nm\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\nRSR / ASR\nRSR\nASR\n10\n50\n100\n150\n200\nn\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\nRSR / ASR\nRSR\nASR\n10\n30\n50\n70\n100\nl\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\nRSR / ASR\nRSR\nASR\n100\n300\n500\n700\n1000\nt\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\nRSR / ASR\nRSR\nASR\nFigure 3: Impact of hyperparameters m, n, l, and t on UniC-RAG.\nImpact of l (length of Pr\ni ). As shown in Figure 3, increasing l leads to higher RSR and a rise followed by a decline in ASR.\nThis is because longer adversarial texts provide more optimization flexibility, making them easier to optimize and thus more\nlikely to be retrieved for user queries. However, as l increases, Pr\ni may dominate the adversarial text, reducing the prominence of\nPg\ni , which in turn leads to the subsequent drop in ASR observed in the curve.\nImpact of t (number of optimization iterations). t controls the number of optimization steps used for optimizing Pr\ni . As shown\nin Figure 3, increasing t leads to a monotonic increase in RSR, as more iterations allow for better optimization of Pr\ni . However,\nthe performance gains may saturate beyond a certain threshold, where additional iterations provide diminishing returns. For\nASR, the curve first increases slightly and then decreases, indicating that excessive optimization can make Pr\ni overly dominant\nand reduce the relative contribution of Pg\ni , which ultimately lowers the ASR at higher iteration counts.\n6\nDefenses\nSeveral defense mechanisms have been proposed to enhance the security of RAG systems [8, 46\u201350, 56]. We apply them in our\nexperiment to evaluate UniC-RAG\u2019s performance against these defense mechanisms.\n6.1\nParaphrasing\nJain et al. [46] proposed paraphrasing defense against adversarial texts. We use an LLM to paraphrase user queries, reducing\ntheir similarity to adversarial texts in the database. In our experiment, we paraphrase all queries in Q using GPT-4o-mini before\nquerying the RAG system. The prompt used for paraphrasing queries can be found in Appendix E. Table 5 demonstrates that\nour UniC-RAG could maintain high RSRs and ASRs against paraphrasing defense. This is because, while paraphrased queries\nundergo rewording and changes in their embedding vectors, they retain their original semantic meaning to avoid degrading utility.\nUniC-RAG optimizes adversarial texts based on semantic similarity, it remains effective in attacking paraphrased queries.\n6.2\nContext-Window Expansion\nZou et al. [8] proposed expanding the context window of RAG systems as a defense against knowledge corruption attacks\nand demonstrated that this strategy significantly mitigates their proposed attack. In our experiment, we evaluate this defense\nby expanding the context window of the RAG system to 30, 40, and 50 texts. However, as shown in Figure 4, unlike Zou et\nal. [8], our UniC-RAG becomes even more effective under a larger context window. This is because all adversarial texts in\nUniC-RAG are designed to target multiple queries while sharing the same attack objective. As a result, increasing the context\nwindow increases the likelihood of retrieving adversarial texts, leading to higher RSRs across all four datasets. On HotpotQA,\nwe observe a slight drop in ASR as the context window expands, though it remains above 95%, indicating that UniC-RAG is\nstill effective. We hypothesize that this minor decline occurs because a larger context window also contains more clean texts\nalongside adversarial texts, providing additional useful information for the LLM to generate an accurate response. Overall, our\nresults demonstrate that UniC-RAG effectively defeats this defense.\n6.3\nRobust and Advanced RAG Systems\nSeveral works [47\u201350, 56] also explored techniques to enhance the robustness of RAG systems by improving the RAG pipeline\nor fine-tuning the LLM. While these techniques are effective in certain settings, they are generally not enough and often\nfall short in defending against many attack scenarios. For instance, Wei et al.

We evaluated UniC-RAG\nagainst InstructRAG with the denial-of-service objective.

A key challenge in UniC-RAG is balancing retrievability and\nresponse manipulation. Adversarial texts must be sufficiently similar to user queries to be retrieved while maintaining the ability\nto influence the LLM\u2019s response. In some cases, increasing similarity for retrieval may reduce the effectiveness of manipulation,\nand vice versa. In our work, we adopt prompt injection attacks to manipulate the response. Future work could explore techniques\nto optimize these two goals simultaneously and improve this trade-off.\nGeneralization to other RAG applications. Our experiments primarily focus on question-answering tasks, as RAG is widely\nused for knowledge-intensive applications. However, our attack methodology can generalize to other RAG-based applications,\nsuch as fact verification, legal document retrieval, or long context chatbots. Future research could investigate the impact of\nuniversal knowledge corruption attacks in these alternative RAG applications.\nAccess to the retriever. Like many existing works [8, 9, 13, 14, 16\u201318, 45], we assume the attacker has white-box access\nto the retriever of the RAG system. This assumption is practical, as many state-of-the-art retrievers are open-source (e.g.,\nContriever [54], DPR [53]), allowing adversaries to optimize adversarial texts effectively. However, in real-world deployments,\nsome RAG systems use closed-source retrievers. Future research could explore the feasibility of black-box attacks, where the\nattacker does not have direct access to the retriever but instead crafts adversarial texts by querying the system and observing\nretrieved results. Investigating query-adaptive and transferable attacks across retrievers would be valuable directions to further\nassess the robustness of RAG systems against knowledge corruption attacks.\n8\nConclusion\nWe propose UniC-RAG, a new universal knowledge corruption attack against RAG systems. Unlike previous attacks which\nprimarily target specific or similar queries, UniC-RAG jointly optimizes a small number of adversarial texts to compromise a\nlarge number of diverse user queries simultaneously, significantly broadening the attack\u2019s effectiveness and impact. Our extensive\nevaluation demonstrates that UniC-RAG successfully compromises a large set of user queries, outperforming baselines. Addi-\ntionally, we evaluate several defense mechanisms and find that they are insufficient to defend against UniC-RAG, underscoring\nthe limitations of current defenses.\n15\n\nReferences\n[1] \u201cBing copilot.\u201d https://copilot.microsoft.com.\n[2] \u201cSearchgpt.\u201d https://openai.com/index/searchgpt-prototype/.\n[3] \u201cGoogle ai search.\u201d https://ai.google/search/.\n[4] J.

However, current LLMs struggle to\nseamlessly integrate knowledge while simultaneously main-\ntaining faithfulness (or fidelity) and expressiveness, capabil-\nities that humans naturally possess. This limitation results\nin outputs that either lack support from external knowledge,\nthereby compromising faithfulness, or appear overly verbose\nand unnatural, thus sacrificing expressiveness. In this work, to\nbreak the trade-off between faithfulness and expressiveness,\nwe propose Collaborative Decoding (CoDe), a novel ap-\nproach that dynamically integrates output probabilities gen-\nerated with and without external knowledge. This integra-\ntion is guided by distribution divergence and model confi-\ndence, enabling the selective activation of relevant and reli-\nable expressions from the model\u2019s internal parameters. Fur-\nthermore, we introduce a knowledge-aware reranking mech-\nanism that prevents over-reliance on prior parametric knowl-\nedge while ensuring proper utilization of provided exter-\nnal information. Through comprehensive experiments, our\nplug-and-play CoDe framework demonstrates superior per-\nformance in enhancing faithfulness without compromising\nexpressiveness across diverse LLMs and evaluation metrics,\nvalidating both its effectiveness and generalizability.\n1\nIntroduction\nAlthough large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated\nremarkable performance across diverse tasks in recent stud-\nies (Bai et al. 2023; Yang et al. 2023a; Touvron et al. 2023;\nOpenAI 2023a,b; Yang et al. 2024; Dai, Yang, and Si 2025),\nthey remain susceptible to hallucination, producing content\nthat appears plausible yet lacks factual accuracy (Ji et al.\n2023; Huang et al. 2025). Research indicates that this phe-\nnomenon arises from fundamental limitations in LLMs, in-\ncluding constrained knowledge boundaries (Ren et al. 2023),\ninsufficient coverage of long-tail knowledge (Kandpal et al.\n2023), and outdated parametric knowledge. These inherent\nconstraints significantly hinder the practical deployment of\nLLMs. To address these challenges, augmenting LLMs with\nexternal knowledge through incorporation into model in-\nputs has emerged as a promising solution, demonstrating\nsubstantial improvements in the factual accuracy of gener-\nated content.

Examples (a), (c), and\n(d) are constrained by the trade-off, whereas our approach\nbreak it and generate responses like (b).\nparadigm, in particular, has gained widespread adoption as\nan effective approach to this problem.\nHowever, external-knowledge-augmented LLMs, such as\nthose employing RAG, continue to face two fundamental\nchallenges. First, they frequently generate content that con-\ntradicts or lacks support from provided knowledge, as shown\nin responses (a) and (c) of Figure 1. Second, they struggle\nto integrate external knowledge naturally, often producing\nresponses with poor interactivity, dullness, and redundancy\n(Chen et al. 2023; Yang et al. 2023b). Response (d) in Fig-\nure 1 illustrates this limitation: the model merely echoes\nthe provided knowledge without addressing the user\u2019s greet-\narXiv:2508.18651v1  [cs.CL]  26 Aug 2025\n\ning, substantially diminishing conversational engagement.\nWhile existing methods address the first challenge (Deng\net al. 2023; Sun et al. 2023; Zhang et al. 2024; Liang et al.\n2024), they neglect or even worsen the second. An effec-\ntive LLM must balance two requirements: it must generate\nresponses grounded in the provided knowledge, a property\nwe define as faithfulness (or fidelity), and it must leverage\nexternal knowledge creatively to produce natural, diverse,\nand engaging responses, which we term expressiveness. We\nprovide detailed definitions for these two properties in Sec-\ntion 3.2. Previous work by Chawla et al. (2024) identified\nthis fidelity-expressiveness conflict through input masking\nexperiments, yet failed to propose a practical solution. We\nextend this analysis to decoding strategies in Section 3.3, re-\nvealing that deterministic decoding sacrifices expressiveness\nwhile stochastic decoding compromises fidelity. This com-\nprehensive understanding enables our principled solution.\nTo resolve this trade-off in LLMs, we propose Collab-\norative Decoding (CoDe), a novel method that dynami-\ncally elicits relevant and factual natural expressions from\nthe model\u2019s internal parameters. CoDe achieves this by\nintegrating output probability distributions generated with\nand without external knowledge, guided by their distribu-\ntional divergence and model confidence. Specifically, we\nemploy Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) to quantify the\ndistribution differences and combine local confidence (max-\nimum probability) with global uncertainty (entropy) to mea-\nsure model confidence, facilitating complementary coop-\neration between two distributions. By enhancing expres-\nsiveness without introducing stochasticity, our approach\neffectively circumvents hallucinations typically associated\nwith sampling-based methods. Additionally, we introduce\na knowledge-aware reranking mechanism to prevent over-\nreliance on parametric knowledge at the expense of exter-\nnal knowledge. This mechanism reranks the top-k candidate\ntokens based on their alignment with external knowledge,\nevaluated by both semantic similarity and attention patterns,\nthereby ensuring faithfulness to the provided knowledge.\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We investigate the trade-off between expressiveness and\nfaithfulness in external-knowledge-augmented LLMs,\nfocusing on decoding strategies.\n\u2022 We introduce CoDe, a novel method that simultane-\nously enhances both faithfulness and expressiveness in\nknowledge-grounded scenarios without requiring addi-\ntional training, model, or generation budgets.\n\u2022 We demonstrate CoDe\u2019s effectiveness and generaliz-\nability through comprehensive experiments, comparing\nagainst ten baseline decoding methods across six LLMs,\nthree datasets, and nine evaluation metrics.\n2\nRelated Work\n2.1\nHallucinations in Text Generation\nHallucination refers to the generation of LLMs appears plau-\nsible but is factually incorrect (Zhang et al. 2023c). The\nresearch community has extensively investigated this phe-\nnomenon from multiple perspectives, including its underly-\ning causes (McKenna et al. 2023; Dziri et al. 2022b), detec-\ntion methodologies (Zhang et al. 2023a; Manakul, Liusie,\nand Gales 2023; Fadeeva et al. 2023), and mitigation strate-\ngies (Choi et al. 2023; Chuang et al. 2023; Li et al. 2023b;\nYang et al. 2025a). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nhas emerged as a prominent approach for mitigating hal-\nlucinations by incorporating external knowledge. Several\nstudies have pursued training-based solutions, constructing\npreference-aligned or human-annotated datasets to fine-tune\nmodels for improved fidelity (Liang et al. 2024; Zhang et al.\n2024). Others have adopted Chain-of-Thought approaches\n(Wei et al. 2022), externalizing implicit knowledge from the\nbackbone LLM (Zhou et al. 2022; Chae et al. 2023; Yu et al.\n2024) or employing self-reflection mechanisms (Asai et al.\n2024). In contrast, our CoDe method offers a lightweight\nsolution that effectively mitigates hallucinations without re-\nquiring training, auxiliary models, or time-intensive reflec-\ntions.\n2.2\nGeneration Decoding Strategy\nDecoding strategies determine next-token selection from vo-\ncabulary probability distributions, including greedy decod-\ning, beam search, and top-k sampling. Nucleus sampling\n(Holtzman et al. 2020) dynamically selects tokens until\nreaching a cumulative probability threshold. While stochas-\ntic methods enhance diversity, they compromise semantic\nconsistency (Basu et al. 2021; Su et al. 2022) and increase\nhallucination rates (Dziri et al. 2022a). Recent contrastive\ndecoding methods have recently gained significant attention.\nContrastive Decoding (Li et al. 2023c) maximizes expert-\namateur log-probability differences for improved fluency.\nDoLa (Chuang et al. 2023) contrasts mature and pre-mature\nlayer logits to reduce hallucinations. CAD (Shi et al. 2024)\namplifies probability differences between context-aware and\ncontext-free outputs. VCD (Leng et al. 2023) contrasts orig-\ninal and distorted visual inputs in vision-language models.\nUnlike these error-filtering approaches, CoDe employs dy-\nnamic collaboration between distributions, simultaneously\noptimizing both fidelity and expressiveness rather than ad-\ndressing single limitations.\n3\nPreliminaries\n3.1\nTask Formulation\nWe consider an LLM parameterized by \u03b8. The model in-\nput comprises four components: a task-specific instruction\nI, multi-turn dialogue history h, the current user utterance\nu, and relevant external knowledge k = (k1, . . . , km) con-\ntaining m tokens. For notational convenience, we define the\nconversation context as x = [I; h; u].\nAt each time step, the LLM generates the next token based\non the input and previously generated tokens y<t, producing\nvocabulary logits:\nlogit\u03b8(yt|\u00b7) = LLM\u03b8(x, k, y<t).\n(1)\nThe probability distribution is obtained via softmax transfor-\nmation, and various decoding strategies select the next token\nyt from the resulting distribution:\ny \u223cp\u03b8(yt|x, k, y<t) \u221dexp logit\u03b8(yt|\u00b7).\n(2)\n\nw.o. knowledge\nw.o. knowledge\nw.o. knowledge\nSampling methods\nFidelity-enhancing methods\nRegular method\nFigure 2: The trade-off between fidelity and expressiveness\nof current decoding strategies on Qwen2.5-chat models at\ndifferent scales. The dashed line indicates the expressiveness\nscore without referring to knowledge.\n3.2\nConceptual Definitions\nFaithfulness (or fidelity) denotes the consistency between\ngenerated responses and external knowledge without contra-\ndictions. A formal definition and distinction from factuality\nare provided in Appendix H.\nExpressiveness encompasses three key dimensions: (1)\ncontext-aware interaction, prioritizing conversational coher-\nence and user engagement over mere information deliv-\nery; (2) natural knowledge integration, extracting and seam-\nlessly incorporating relevant information rather than copy-\ning source text; and (3) linguistic diversity, exhibiting varied\nexpression patterns while avoiding formulaic language.\n3.3\nPilot Observations and Insights\nThere remains considerable potential for improve-\nment in expressiveness and fidelity.\nIntegrating external\nknowledge into LLMs creates a fundamental tension: while\nimproving informativeness, it often diminishes response ex-\npressiveness. As shown in Figure 1 (panels c-d) and quanti-\nfied in Figure 2, LLMs tend to directly copy external knowl-\nedge rather than seamlessly incorporating it, resulting in de-\ncreased expressiveness scores. This suggests that LLMs sac-\nrifice discourse coherence and naturalness when prioritizing\nfaithful information transmission. Moreover, a substantial fi-\ndelity gap exists between LLM and human-generated con-\ntent. Despite external knowledge access, LLMs frequently\nproduce contradictory outputs due to flawed reasoning or\nconflicts with their parametric knowledge, as illustrated in\nFigure 1 (panels a, c). Figure 9 confirms that even advanced\nopen-source LLMs significantly underperform humans in\nmaintaining knowledge fidelity, highlighting persistent chal-\nlenges in neural knowledge grounding.\nCurrent decoding strategies reveal a fundamental trade-\noff between expressiveness and knowledge fidelity. As\nillustrated in Figure 2, this dilemma manifests distinctly\nacross different decoding approaches: deterministic decod-\ning yields content with high fidelity but compromised ex-\npressiveness, whereas stochastic decoding enhances linguis-\ntic diversity at the cost of factual accuracy. Notably, this\ntrade-off is particularly pronounced in smaller-scale models,\nwhich exhibit greater sensitivity to the choice of decoding\nstrategy. This paper aims to break the trade-off by proposing\na novel approach that achieve a win-win situation for both\nfaithfulness and expressiveness. The experimental setups for\nthe pilot study are detailed in Appendix A.\n4\nApproach\nThis section presents Collaborative Decoding (CoDe), a\nnovel method for external-knowledge-augmented LLMs\ncomprising two key components, as illustrated in Figure 3.\n4.1\nAdaptive Dual-Stream Fusion\nAs shown in Section 3.3, models with external knowledge\ninput tend to copy knowledge fragments, thereby diminish-\ning expressiveness. While stochastic decoding methods like\ntop-k (Fan, Lewis, and Dauphin 2018) and nucleus sampling\n(Holtzman et al. 2020) mitigates this issue, their probabilis-\ntic nature inevitably induces hallucinations. We hope to pro-\npose a deterministic approach that enhances expressiveness\nwithout sacrificing factual accuracy.\nDistribution Collaboration.\nInspired by contrastive de-\ncoding (Li et al. 2023c), we propose a dual-stream fusion ap-\nproach that emphasizes complementary collaboration rather\nthan error filtering through contrast. CoDe generates two\noutput distributions: an expressiveness-oriented stream con-\nditioned solely on conversation context x, and a faithfulness-\noriented stream conditioned on both context x and external\nknowledge k. These streams are then fused to create a col-\nlaborative distribution that breaks the trade-off between ex-\npressiveness and faithfulness :\npCoDe(yt) = softmax[\u03b1 logit\u03b8(yt|x, k, y<t)\n+ (1 \u2212\u03b1) logit\u03b8(yt|x, y<t)],\n(3)\nwhere larger \u03b1 indicates more weight on the faithfulness-\noriented stream. The Equation 3 could also be written as:\npCoDe \u221dp\u03b8(yt|x, y<t)\n\u0012p\u03b8(yt|x, k, y<t)\np\u03b8(yt|x, y<t)\n\u0013\u03b1\n.\n(4)\nIn this formulation, p\u03b8(yt|x, y<t) represents the prior dis-\ntribution based solely on the model\u2019s parametric knowl-\nedge, while p\u03b8(yt|x, k, y<t) denotes the posterior distribu-\ntion conditioned on external knowledge k. CoDe leverages\npointwise mutual information (PMI) between k and yt to\ndynamically recalibrate output probabilities, amplifying to-\nkens strongly associated with external knowledge.\nAdaptive Fusion Weights \u03b1.\nTo prevent hallucinations\nfrom low-probability tokens, we adaptively modulate \u03b1\nbased on model confidence and distribution divergence.\nWhen internal knowledge exhibits low relevance or high un-\ncertainty, CoDe reduces parametric reliance and prioritizes\nexternal knowledge integration.\n\u03b1 =\n\u03b4 \u00b7 Ck\nt\nCc\nt + \u03b4 \u00b7 Ck\nt\n,\n(5)\nwhere Ck\nt and Cc\nt denotes the confidence of posterior and\nprior knowledge, \u03b4 denotes the distribution divergence.\n\n\n\nKnowledge chunk\nI am a basketball fan!

Conversely, when the distri-\nbutions align closely, indicating consistent knowledge rep-\nresentations, we increase the prior weight to leverage pre-\ntrained knowledge for enhanced expressiveness. To imple-\nment this adaptive mechanism, we introduce a dynamic pa-\nrameter \u03b4 in the design of \u03b1:\n\u03b4 = \u03b3 \u00b7 exp(JSD (pc(yt)\u2225pk(yt))),\n(8)\nwhere JSD(\u00b7, \u00b7) denotes the Jensen-Shannon Divergence,\nand \u03b3 is a scale factor.\n4.2\nKnowledge-Aware Reranking\nTo prevent the model from being overly confident in its prior\nparameter knowledge and thereby ignoring external knowl-\nedge, we introduce a knowledge-aware reranking mecha-\nnism that further refines CoDe\u2019s output distribution:\n\u02c6pCoDe(yt) = topK\nn\n(1 \u2212\u03b2) pCoDe(yt)+\n\u03b2\n2\nh\nmax\nki\u2208k{sim(hyt, hki)} + max\nkj\u2208k{att(yt, kj)}\nio\n,\n(9)\nwhere \u03b2 controls the fidelity amplification strength, h rep-\nresents hidden states, sim(\u00b7, \u00b7) denotes cosine similarity, and\natt(yt, kj) represents the max-pooled attention weight be-\ntween token yt and knowledge element kj across all layers\nand heads. The knowledge-aware reranking mechanism en-\nsures fidelity through two complementary rewards: (1) se-\nmantic reward, which favors tokens with high cosine sim-\nilarity to external knowledge tokens, and (2) attentive re-\nward, which prioritizes tokens exhibiting stronger attention\nto knowledge segments. As illustrated in Figure 3, when\ninternal and external knowledge conflict (e.g., the model\u2019s\n\u201d14 seasons\u201d versus the correct \u201d15 seasons\u201d for Jordan),\nthis mechanism amplifies external knowledge awareness,\nenabling accurate token selection (14 \u219215).\nThe final token yt is selected from the top-K candidates\nbased on the combined score of fidelity and expressiveness:\nyt = arg max \u02c6pCoDe(yt).\n(10)\n5\nExperiments\n5.1\nExperimental Setup\nDatasets\nand\nModels.\ne\nevaluated\nCoDe\non\nthree\ninformation-seeking dialogue datasets\u2014FAITHDIAL (Dziri\net al. 2022a), HalluDial (Luo et al. 2024), and WoW (Dinan\net al. 2018)\u2014which provide dialogue contexts with external\nknowledge for response generation.

Search Methods: Greedy Decoding (Greedy), Beam\nSearch (Beam), Contrastive Search (CS) (Su et al. 2022),\nand FECS (Chen et al. 2023). Stochastic Methods: Top-k\nSampling (Fan, Lewis, and Dauphin 2018), Nucleus Sam-\npling (Nulceus) (Holtzman et al. 2020), and Factual-Nucleus\nSampling (F-Nucleus) (Lee et al. 2023). Contrastive Meth-\nods: Contrastive Decoding (CD) (Li et al. 2023c), DoLa\n(Chuang et al. 2023), and Context-Aware Decoding (CAD)\n(Shi et al. 2024). The details of the baseline introduction and\nhyperparameter settings are found in the Appendix C.\n5.2\nExperimental Results\nAutomatic Evaluation\nWe conducted comprehensive au-\ntomated evaluation using 9 metrics across 3 dimensions:\nFaithfulness. We employed three metrics: K-BP (BERT-\nPrecision between knowledge and response) (Chen et al.\n2023), F-Critic (average entailment score using FaithCritic\nNLI model) (Dziri et al. 2022a), and H-Judge (faithfulness\n(a) CoDe\n(b) CAD\n(c) Nucleus \nDensity \nCoverage\nFigure 5: Knowledge utilization patterns across CoDe,\nCAD, and Nucleus decoding methods. Bottom-right concen-\ntration indicates superior performance.\nratio assessed by HalluJudge LLM) (Luo et al. 2024).\nExpressiveness. We assessed diversity (DIV), context co-\nherence (COH), and creative knowledge utilization (CRE).\nDIV measures lexical diversity via geometric mean of\nDistinct-n (n=1,2,3,4) (Li et al. 2016). COH quantifies\ncontext-response alignment through cosine similarity of sen-\ntence embeddings (Su et al. 2022; Li et al. 2023c). CRE eval-\nuates non-extractive knowledge use the COVERAGE divided\nby the square root of DENSITY (Grusky, Naaman, and Artzi\n2020). See Appendix E for details.\nQuality. Overall quality was measured using standard\noverlap-based metrics: BLEU (Papineni et al. 2002), ME-\nTEOR (Banerjee and Lavie 2005), and ROUGE (Lin 2004).\nResults. As shown in Tables 1 and 6, CoDe consistently\noutperforms all ten baseline methods across three faithful-\nness metrics on all datasets. Our approach also achieves top-\n2 performance in diversity and relevance metrics. Notably,\nthe CRE scores indicate that CoDe reduces direct knowl-\nedge copying compared to other fidelity-enhancing methods\nlike Beam Search and CAD. We further analyzed knowl-\nedge utilization patterns, as shown in Figure 5. CoDe ex-\nhibits lower density than CAD while maintaining higher\ncoverage than sampling methods, indicating substantial to-\nken overlap with knowledge sources but minimal contiguous\ncopying. This pattern suggests that CoDe integrates exter-\nnal knowledge more naturally and diversely, extracting rele-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel\nMethod\nExpressiveness\nFaithfulness\nQuality\nAvg.\nDIV\nCOH\nCRE\nF-Critic\nH-Judge\nK-BP\nBLEU-2/4\nMETEOR\nROUGE-L\nMistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2\ngreedy\n34.2\n59.5\n41.3\n21.8\n89.8\n59.9\n15.0/6.7\n19.6\n25.2\n37.3\ntop-k\n35.2\n59.5\n46.8\n16.8\n87.0\n57.4\n14.3/6.1\n18.9\n23.7\n36.6\nCAD\n33.1\n58.3\n35.2\n23.9\n91.2\n62.5\n15.0/6.6\n20.4\n25.3\n37.1\nCoDe\n35.4\n59.9\n38.7\n24.3\n91.3\n62.7\n15.5/6.9\n20.6\n25.0\n38.0\nLlama-3.1-8B-chat\ngreedy\n34.4\n53.4\n34.2\n46.6\n92.2\n67.7\n21.6/10.4\n22.2\n31.0\n41.4\ntop-k\n36.0\n53.2\n35.1\n42.9\n91.5\n62.9\n19.8/9.4\n20.6\n28.8\n40.0\nCAD\n29.7\n50.5\n23.8\n49.7\n93.3\n72.5\n21.0/9.8\n23.0\n30.3\n40.4\nCoDe\n35.7\n54.5\n33.8\n50.2\n94.0\n71.7\n21.9/10.8\n23.5\n30.8\n42.7\nQwen-2.5-3B-chat\ngreedy\n37.7\n52.4\n37.6\n38.7\n90.5\n56.2\n18.6/8.5\n16.2\n25.8\n38.2\ntop-k\n40.0\n50.7\n45.9\n29.0\n85.4\n53.8\n16.9/7.5\n15.5\n23.9\n36.9\nCAD\n34.8\n48.5\n31.9\n39.6\n91.4\n61.0\n19.1/8.6\n17.3\n26.5\n37.9\nCoDe\n39.4\n54.4\n37.0\n42.9\n92.9\n61.3\n20.9/9.8\n18.9\n27.4\n40.5\nQwen-2.5-7B-chat\ngreedy\n36.8\n55.7\n40.5\n36.0\n91.2\n61.6\n16.8/7.6\n18.5\n25.5\n39.0\ntop-k\n37.3\n54.8\n45.5\n32.8\n88.7\n58.0\n15.2/7.0\n17.6\n24.4\n38.1\nCAD\n35.2\n52.6\n34.6\n38.4\n92.8\n63.6\n17.8/8.0\n20.5\n26.1\n39.0\nCoDe\n37.7\n55.8\n40.8\n39.6\n92.8\n64.8\n17.6/8.0\n20.6\n26.4\n40.4\nQwen-2.5-14B-chat\ngreedy\n37.8\n53.6\n39.3\n36.6\n91.9\n65.4\n21.7/10.3\n21.6\n30.1\n40.8\ntop-k\n38.5\n53.4\n43.8\n36.2\n91.6\n63.8\n21.3/10.0\n21.5\n29.4\n41.0\nCAD\n35.1\n52.8\n36.5\n36.4\n91.9\n66.5\n22.0/10.3\n21.4\n30.3\n40.3\nCoDe\n38.6\n53.6\n39.6\n36.9\n92.6\n66.2\n22.4/10.5\n22.0\n30.7\n41.3\nTable 2: Automatic evaluation results compared with SoTA baselines across five LLMs on the FAITHDIAL dataset.\nMethod\nAcc\nROUGE-L\nBERT-P\nAvg.\nGreedy\n56.3\n20.4\n53.8\n43.5\nBeam\n58.1\n21.6\n55.7\n45.1\nCS\n55.9\n19.2\n52.0\n42.4\nFECS\n57.6\n23.0\n57.1\n45.9\nF-Nucleus\n49.5\n18.8\n48.9\n39.1\nDoLa\n56.1\n20.4\n53.9\n43.5\nCAD\n57.4\n22.9\n56.3\n45.5\nCoDe\n58.8\n22.4\n58.3\n46.5\nTable 3: Evaluation results on the HalluEval (summariza-\ntion) dataset (Llama2-7B-chat).\nvant information without resorting to verbatim reproduction.\nTables 7 and 8 (in Appendix) demonstrate that CoDe per-\nforms more closely to the ground-truth in traditional metrics,\nindicating its overall better performance.

Five well-\neducated annotators compared responses from CoDe and\nbaseline methods across three criteria: Naturalness, Creativ-\nity, and Faithfulness (detailed evaluation guidelines are in\nFigure 10). Inter-annotator agreement was measured using\nFleiss\u2019 kappa (Fleiss 1971). As shown in Figure 6, CoDe sig-\nnificantly outperformed all baselines in faithfulness. For cre-\nativity, annotators preferred CoDe 1.25\u00d7 over greedy search\nand 5.5\u00d7 over CAD.

We evaluated five compo-\nnents on FAITHDIAL using Llama2-7B-chat: Dynamic Fu-\nsion Weight (-\u03b1), Expressiveness-Oriented Stream (-EOS),\nKnowledge-Aware Reranking (-KAR), semantic reward (-\nSem), and attentive reward (-Att). Table 5 shows that all\nmodules are essential. Setup A (equal-weight stream fu-\nsion) degrades performance across both dimensions, empha-\nsizing the importance of adaptive internal knowledge uti-\nlization. Removing EOS reduces expressiveness similar to\nother fidelity-focused baselines. Without KAR, expressive-\nness slightly improves but fidelity drops unacceptably. Se-\ntups D and E confirm both reward mechanisms are neces-\nsary. Figure 7 indicates optimal performance at \u03b2=0.6 and\n\u03b3=3. The smooth performance curves across different pa-\nrameter values demonstrate CoDe\u2019s robustness.\n5.4\nQualitative Examples\nWe demonstrate CoDe\u2019s ability to generate informative and\nengaging responses through several case studies.

Extensive experi-\nments across six LLMs and multiple benchmarks demon-\nstrate that CoDe successfully overcomes the faithfulness-\nexpressiveness trade-off. This work opens new avenues\nfor developing decoding strategies that leverage the com-\nplementary strengths of internal and external knowledge\nsources, ultimately advancing the capabilities of LLM as-\nsistants in real-world applications.\n\nReferences\nAsai, A.; Wu, Z.; Wang, Y.; Sil, A.; and Hajishirzi, H.\n2024.

Dublin,\nIreland: Association for Computational Linguistics.\nA\nPreliminary Experimental Setups.\nIn the example shown in Table 11, Greedy Search mistak-\nenly treated Madonna\u2019s cover song as her original work,\nleading to a factual mistake. Greedy Search, Nucleus Sam-\npling, and DoLa all confused song titles with album names,\nand generated many songs that cannot be verified by exter-\nnal knowledge. Although DoLa indeed activated the model\u2019s\ninternal knowledge to produce numerous accurate song ti-\ntles, it kept listing them endlessly, resulting in an excessively\nlong response. CAD failed to respond to the user\u2019s query\nand simply copied external information into the reply, show-\ning weak expression capabilities. By comparison, CoDe not\nonly interacted with the user, but also correctly utilized ex-\nternal knowledge.\nB\nDatasets\nWoW is collected based on Wikipedia, with one crowd-\nsourcer acts as a knowledgeable wizard and the other plays\nthe role of an inquisitive apprentice. The objective is to gen-\nerate responses based on given knowledge snippets, taken\nfrom Wikipedia, that are pertinent to the conversation topic.\nThe ground-truth responses in the dataset are annotated by\nhumans based on the best knowledge they selected. We eval-\nuated all the decoding methods on both the test seen and un-\nseen set. The test seen set includes 4,336 samples where the\ntopics were seen in the training set, while the unseen test set\nincludes 4,370 samples where the topics were not seen in the\ntraining set (Dinan et al. 2018).\n\nMethod\nWoW-Seen\nWoW-Unseen\nExpressiveness\nFaithfulness\nAvg.\nExpressiveness\nFaithfulness\nAvg.\nDIV\nCOH\nCRE\nF-Critic\nH-Judge\nK-BP\nDIV\nCOH\nCRE\nF-Critic\nH-Judge\nK-BP\nGreedy\n31.5\n58.3\n28.7\n19.5\n84.2\n58.1\n46.7\n22.4\n58.2\n28.8\n17.6\n86.7\n58.6\n45.4\nBeam\n30.7\n58.6\n24.1\n22.1\n86.1\n62.4\n47.3\n21.4\n58.9\n24.0\n22.9\n87.6\n62.8\n46.3\nCS\n32.0\n58.4\n29.0\n21.0\n84.2\n57.6\n47.0\n23.0\n57.5\n28.6\n18.9\n85.9\n58.4\n45.4\nFECS\n33.4\n57.8\n28.1\n23.5\n86.3\n61.9\n48.5\n23.3\n57.2\n28.6\n22.9\n88.6\n61.9\n47.1\ntop-k\n35.8\n58.2\n33.4\n15.0\n66.5\n53.9\n43.8\n29.8\n57.7\n33.6\n14.2\n70.1\n54.5\n43.3\nNucleus\n34.9\n58.4\n33.1\n16.3\n73.6\n54.9\n45.2\n28.2\n57.8\n32.8\n15.9\n76.8\n55.5\n44.5\nF-Nucleus\n33.9\n58.7\n31.3\n16.7\n77.6\n56.1\n45.7\n26.6\n58.4\n31.3\n17.5\n80.0\n56.6\n45.1\nCD\n34.7\n57.1\n32.9\n16.3\n68.9\n57.0\n44.5\n34.9\n56.9\n33.0\n13.7\n73.8\n57.5\n45.0\nDoLa\n33.1\n58.0\n30.4\n22.9\n84.2\n57.9\n47.8\n23.9\n57.5\n31.3\n21.6\n85.9\n58.4\n46.4\nCAD\n28.1\n53.9\n18.6\n26.4\n86.7\n65.6\n46.5\n20.7\n53.6\n21.8\n22.6\n87.7\n64.8\n45.2\nCoDe\n35.2\n58.9\n27.7\n26.8\n88.0\n65.0\n50.3\n30.1\n58.6\n28.1\n25.6\n89.7\n65.2\n49.6\nTable 6: Automatic evaluation results on the WoW dataset (Llama2-7B-chat).

Subjective and hallucinated\ninformation present in the wizard\u2019s utterance of WoW data\nare edited into utterances faithful to the given knowledge in\nthis dataset. We evaluated all the decoding methods on its\ntest set, which contains 3,539 samples (Dziri et al. 2022a).\nHalluDial is the first comprehensive large-scale bench-\nmark for dialogue-level hallucination evaluation. It is de-\nrived from an information-seeking dialogue dataset and cov-\ners factuality and faithfulness hallucinations. The bench-\nmark includes 4,094 dialogues with a total of 146,856\nsamples. We selected 3,000 samples from its 18,357 non-\nhallucinatory samples as the test set in our experiments.\nC\nBaselines\nBeam search selected the most probable k tokens from the\nprobability distribution at each step to expand the search\nspace (Boulanger-Lewandowski, Bengio, and Vincent 2013;\nSutskever, Vinyals, and Le 2014). We set the beam size to 4\nin our experiment.\nCS: Su et al. (2022) penalized previously generated tokens\nto overcome degeneration and enhance content diversity.\nWe set k|\u03b1 = 4|0.6.\nFECS: Chen et al. (2023) extended Contrastive Search by\nintegrating a faithfulness term that encourages factuality.\nWe set k|\u03b1|\u03b2 = 4|0.3|0.3.\nTop-k Sampling introduced randomness into the genera-\ntion process by selecting from the top-k most likely tokens\n\n(Fan, Lewis, and Dauphin 2018). We set k = 50 in our\nexperiment.\nNucleus sampling considered a dynamic number of words\nthat cumulatively reach the probability p (Holtzman et al.\n2020). We set p = 0.9 in our experiment.\nF-Nucleus: Lee et al. (2023) modified Nucleus Sampling\nby adapting the randomness dynamically to improve the\nfactuality of generation. We set p|\u03bb|\u03c9 = 0.9|0.9|0.7 in our\nexperiment.\nCD: Li et al. (2023c) maximized the difference between\nexpert log-probabilities and amateur log-probabilities to\nimprove fluency and diversity. We use Llama2-7B-chat as\nthe expert model and Sheared-LLaMA-2.7B-ShareGPT as\nthe amateur model (Xia et al. 2023). We set the amateur\ntemperature \u03c4 to 1.0. We select the generated tokens using a\ngreedy search on the contrasted distributions.\nDoLa: Chuang et al. (2023) amplified the factual knowledge\nin LLM by contrasting the logits from different layers to\nenhance factuality. We set the dola layers hyperparameter\nto \u2019high\u2019 in our experiments. We select the generated tokens\nusing a greedy search on the contrasted distributions.\nCAD: Chuang et al. (2023) amplified the difference be-\ntween output probabilities with and without the context\ndocument to highlight the external knowledge. We set the\nhyperparameter \u03b1 to 1.0. We select the generated tokens\nusing a greedy search on the contrasted distributions.\nD\nImplementation Details\nWe conducted experiments by utilizing the open-source\nHugging Face transformers (Wolf et al. 2020). All experi-\nments are conducted with few-shot prompting (three shots).\nThe three demonstrations are manually selected from the\nFAITHDIAL dataset, and they are used consistently for all\nmethods during evaluation. We conducted three experiments\nfor all methods, using a different set of samples in each\nexperiment, and finally took the average of the results to\neliminate the impact of randomness. We exhibits a set of\ndemonstrations with task instructions in the Appendix G.\nAs our focus is on the generation process following the ac-\nquisition of retrieval knowledge, we assume that the knowl-\nedge provided to the model is the most appropriate. For\nour CoDe and all baselines, we directly use manually an-\nnotated golden knowledge from the three datasets as input\nin the experiments. For the hyperparameters in CoDe, we\nset k|\u03b2|\u03b3 = 4|0.6|3. For other decoding hyperparameters,\nwe set them to be the same for all methods. We set the\nmin new tokens to 5, and the batch size to 1.\nFaithfulness\nBERT-Precision\nFaithCritic\nHallujudge\nExpressiveness\nDiversity\nCoherence\nCreativeness\nQuality\nBLEU\nMETEOR\nROUGE-L\nTable 9: Automatic Evaluation metircs.\nE\nEvaluation Metrics\nE.1\nAutomatic Evaluation Metrics\nFaithfulness\nTo evaluate faithfulness, we adopted three\nfaithfulness evaluation metrics, which has been demon-\nstrated to achieve high correlations with human judgment.\nK-BP. We calculated BERT-Precision (Pagnoni, Balachan-\ndran, and Tsvetkov 2021) between the external knowledge\nand generated response (K-BP) following Shi et al. (2024)\nto measure the consistency from the perspective of semantic\nsimilarity.\nF-Critic. FaithCritic is a faithfulness discrimination model\nfine-tuned on the FAITHCRITIC dataset, which is initial-\nized with RoBERTa-Large. This model outputs the proba-\nbility of positive and negative labels in the form of a binary-\nclassification Natural Language Inference (NLI) task, where\nresponses with subjective and hallucinatory information are\npredicted as negative labels. F-Critic. is the average entail-\nment score on the FaithCritic model.\nH-Judge. H-Judge is the ratio of samples judged to be faith-\nful by the Hallujudge model (Luo et al. 2024). Since the au-\nthors did not release the weights of Hallujudge, we trained\nthe Hallujudge model on the HalluDial dataset using Meta-\nLlama-3-8B with the hyperparameters specified in the paper.\nExpressiveness\nWe considered the model\u2019s expressive-\nness in terms of three aspects: diversity, context coherence,\nand the creativity in knowledge utilization.\nDIV. Diversity (DIV) is calculated as the geometric mean of\nDistinct-n (n=1, 2, 3, 4) (Li et al. 2016):\nDIV =\n4\nv\nu\nu\nt\n4\nY\nn=1\nDistinct-n.\n(11)\nCOH. Following Su et al. (2022) and Li et al. (2023c), we\napproximated coherence by cosine similarity between the\nsentence embeddings of context x and generation y:\nCOH =\nEMB(x) \u00b7 EMB(y)\n||EMB(x)|| \u00b7 ||EMB(y)||,\n(12)\nwhere EMB(\u00b7) is the SimCSE sentence embedding (Gao,\nYao, and Chen 2021).\nCRE. To calculated CRE, we use the COVERAGE divided\nby the square root of DENSITY (Grusky, Naaman, and Artzi\n2020) as follows:\nCRE = Coverage\n2\u221aDensity,\n(13)\nCoverage(k, y) = 1\n|y|\nX\nf\u2208F(k,y)\n|f|,\n(14)\nDensity(k, y) = 1\n|y|\nX\nf\u2208F(k,y)\n|f|2,\n(15)\nwhere F(k, y) is the set of shared sequences of tokens in\nknowledge k and response y. A higher Coverage score indi-\ncates more knowledge are integrated into the response, while\na lower Density score indicates the knowledge are weaved\ninto response naturally and creatively. To unify the measure-\nment of Coverage and Density, we performed a square root\noperation on Density.\n\nQuality\nTo assess the overall quality of generated re-\nsponses, we selected three widely-used metrics based on\ncalculating overlap with the ground-truth: BLEU (Papineni\net al. 2002), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie 2005), and\nROUGE (Lin 2004).\nE.2\nLLM-based Evaluation Metrics\nWe perform LLM-based evaluation according to the follow-\ning criteria: Naturalness (Nat.), Coherence (Coh.), Infor-\nmativeness (Inf.), Creativity (Cre.), Faithfulness (Fai.), and\nFactuality (Fac.). High naturalness refers to the generated\ncontent being realistic, engaging, and interactive, capable of\nencouraging users to engage in more rounds of conversation.\nHigh coherence means the generated content is related to the\ncontext and maintains a smooth flow. High informativeness\nindicates that the generated content is rich in information\nand can help users acquire new knowledge. High creativity\nrefers to the model\u2019s diverse utilization of external knowl-\nedge, rather than mechanically extracting and directly out-\nputting it. High faithfulness indicates that the generated con-\ntent does not contain information that directly contradicts\nthe given knowledge, or cannot be verified from the provided\nknowledge. High factuality indicates that the generated con-\ntent does not conflict with established world knowledge. To\nstrictly differentiate between faithfulness and factuality, we\nincluded detailed definitions for both in Appendix H. Table\n10 shows the prompts we used for LLM-based evaluation\n(LLM-as-a-Judge). Our evaluation was conducted using gpt-\n4o-2024-08-06.\nE.3\nHuman Evaluation Metrics\nGiven the dialogue context, related knowledge and the re-\nsponses generated by CoDe and its baselines, five well-\neducated annotators were asked to choose the superior re-\nsponse based on three criteria: Naturalness (Nat.), Engag-\ningness (Eng.), and Faithfulness (Fai.). Detailed evaluation\nguidelines can be seen in Figure 10.\nF\nAdditional Related Work\nF.1\nKnowledge-Grounded Dialog Generation\nKnowledge-grounded dialogue generation aims to alleviate\ndull and unfaithful responses by injecting external knowl-\nedge into input of dialogue models and it consists of two\nsubtasks: knowledge selection and response generation. The\nhot spot of early research is mainly concentrated on how to\nimprove the performance of knowledge selection (Sun, Ren,\nand Ren 2023; Xu et al. 2022; Zhan et al. 2021; Yang et al.\n2022; Meng et al. 2021; Kim, Ahn, and Kim 2020; Wang\net al. 2022, 2025; Yang et al. 2023b). With the remarkable\nleap in the capabilities of generative models, the research\nfocus gradually shifts to the response generation subtask\n(Zhao et al. 2020a; Liu et al. 2021; Zhao et al. 2020b; Zheng,\nMilic-Frayling, and Zhou 2021; Chen et al. 2024; Yang et al.\n2025b). Ideally, a brilliant robot should generate informa-\ntive and truthful responses while maintaining the naturalistic\nphrasing and excellent interactivity (Dziri et al. 2022a).\nG\nDetails of the Generation Prompts\nOur instruction template and demonstrations for prompting\nLarge Language Models to generate response during evalu-\ntaion are as follows:\nAs an assistant, your task is to engage in a chit-chat con-\nversation with user. You will be provided the dialogue history\nand a piece of related knowledge, and your task is to utilize\nthe knowledge to continue the conversation. Your English\nresponse should be informative but no more than 50 words,\ncoherent with the dialogue context and faithful to the given\nknowledge.\nYou SHOULD refer to the following examples:\nExample 1:\nUser\u2019s utterance: Shower.\n###knowledge###: Ancient people began to reproduce these\nnatural phenomena by pouring jugs of water, often very cold,\nover themselves after washing.\nYour knowledge-grounded response to the user: I love taking\nshowers! I do not know how I would live without the modern\nshowers. In ancient times people would pour jugs of cold\nwater over themselves and consider that a shower.\nExample 2:\nUser\u2019s utterance: Is rock and roll still popular today?\nYour response: It\u2019s hard to say. However, radio stations have\nmuch success playing classic rock and roll, which is a sub\ngenre that usually has one or two electric guitars, a double\nbass or string bass or electric bass guitar, and a drum kit.\nUser\u2019s utterance: I used to listen to the rock band Rolling\nStones. Are they still around today?\nYour response: They are!

However, they often do not articulate\ntheir inner thoughts, including their intentions\nand chosen methodologies. Consequently, crit-\nical insights essential for bridging reasoning\nsteps may be absent in training data collected\nfrom human sources. To bridge this gap, we\nproposes inserting insights between consecu-\ntive reasoning steps, which review the status\nand initiate the next reasoning steps. Unlike\nprior prompting strategies that rely on a single\nor a workflow of static prompts to facilitate rea-\nsoning, insights are proactively generated to\nguide reasoning processes. We implement our\nidea as a reasoning framework, named Think-\ning Before You Speak (TBYS), and design a\npipeline for automatically collecting and filter-\ning in-context examples for the generation of\ninsights, which alleviates human labeling ef-\nforts and fine-tuning overheads.

Through\nits generated reasoning, O1 exhibits advanced cog-\nnitive skills, such as problem decomposition, er-\nror identification, and correction \u2013 processes that\ncontinuously guide thinking toward accurate so-\nlutions. Inspired by this, various test-time scal-\ning (Snell et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2025) ap-\nproaches were proposed, such as using prompts\nInsight\nProblem\nReasoning\nReasoning\nInsight\nTBYS/Human\nConventional\nTraining Data\nFigure 1: A simplified example to compare the reason-\ning trace of human and TBYS against one from conven-\ntional training data. Humans and TBYS excel with a\nflow of insight-driven reasoning that is more compre-\nhensible. On the other hand, the training set example\nadds to the difficulty of learning, as it is not always\nstraightforward to re-engineer the connection between\nconsecutive steps behind the succinct reasoning logic.\nTBYS proactively fill reasoning gaps with insights rep-\nresenting intention, explanation, or justification, etc.\narXiv:2508.18648v1  [cs.CL]  26 Aug 2025\n\nThe average of Amy's, Ben's, and Chris's ages is 6.\n\nFour years ago, Chris was the same age as Amy is now.\nIn four years, Ben's age will be 3 of Amy's age at that\n\ntime.

Thus, Chris's\n\nage is] 10|.\n\n\nUsing these equations, we can\nsubstitute and solve for A, B, and C\n\nlike \u201cWait,\u201d (Muennighoff et al., 2025) to stimulate\nself-correction, \u201cWait, using Python\u201d to encourage\ncoding (Li et al., 2025a), or fixed workflows of\nprompts to structure inferences (Hong et al., 2024).\nHowever, these methods suffer from task and LLM\nsensitivity. For instance, certain agentic workflows\n(e.g., MetaGPT (Hong et al., 2024)) may improve\ncoding tasks but not Q&A performance. Similarly,\nLLMs exhibit sensitivity to prompt design, includ-\ning style and example ordering (Zhuo et al., 2024).\nAs a result, they are most effective when paired\nwith reinforcement learning techniques (e.g., rejec-\ntion sampling) to filter suboptimal cases, but are\nill-suited for direct application to scale reasoning\nat test time.\nThis paper introduces a novel prompting\nparadigm called proactive prompting, where an\nLLM proactively generates prompts to steer its\nown reasoning steps, rather than passively reacting\nto predefined prompting patterns. This approach\ndemonstrates particular advantages in complex rea-\nsoning tasks, such as advanced mathematics prob-\nlems, where the proactive generation of \u201cinner\nthoughts\u201d (critical for guiding reasoning) is often\nabsent from final reasoning outputs in conventional\ntraining data.\nTo validate this paradigm, we develop a rea-\nsoning framework named Thinking Before You\nSpeak (TBYS), which iteratively inserts a proactive\nprompt \u2013 termed the insight \u2013 before each reason-\ning step to explicitly define the status and the goal\nof that step. Figure 1 contrasts a TBYS reasoning\nprocess with that in conventional training data (with\nwhich LLMs are trained). TBYS mirrors human\ninner-thinking patterns, producing more explain-\nable reasoning traces that facilitate LLM learning\nand offering greater educational values for human\nreaders.\nIn the remainder of this paper, we detail the\nTBYS reasoning framework in Section 2. Since\nTBYS relies on iteratively generating insights to\nguide reasoning, the quality of these generated in-\nsights is critical to its accuracy. To address this, we\nemploy in-context learning with examples retrieved\nfrom a library of insight exemplars. Section 3 de-\nscribes our pipeline for automatically collecting,\nfiltering, and selecting example insights for this li-\nbrary. Section 4 briefly reviews prior related work.\nFinally, Section 5 evaluates TBYS against strong\nbaselines on challenging datasets, demonstrating\nsignificant performance improvements and better\naccuracy-overhead trade-offs. We further conduct\nablation studies to validate the contributions of key\ncomponents.\nHistory: Ht-1=(q,(i1,s1)\u2026)\nInsight itpre\nretrieve\nExamples Et\nInsight it\nSolution step st\ngenerate\nAdd (it,st) to history and iterate\ngenerate\ngenerate\nevaluate\nTYBS Reasoning\nDataset DS\ninitialize\nscore\nfilter\nDataset DG\nLibrary Construction \nFigure 2: The TBYS reasoning framework (Section 2)\nand insight library construction (Section 3).\n2\nThe TBYS Reasoning Framework\nTBYS utilizes a library L of high-quality insights.\nThe automatic construction of this library is de-\ntailed in Section 3. During inference, examples\nare retrieved from L using some off-the-shelf em-\nbedding model for in-context learning. We also\nmanually define three seed examples S, each con-\ntaining a question and the complete reasoning steps\nfor the question with the associated insights.\nAs shown in Figure 2, TBYS employs a\nmulti-round reasoning approach.\nEach round\nt consists of three steps:\n(1) Insight Genera-\ntion:\nA preliminary insight ipre\nt\nis generated\nbased on the current reasoning history Ht\u22121 =\n(q, (i1, s1), (i2, s2), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (it\u22121, st\u22121)), where q is\nthe question, and ij, sj denote the insight and so-\nlution step in round j, respectively. (2) Example\nRetrieval: Each insight is defined by its two com-\nponents: situation (summarizing the current rea-\nsoning status) and goal (stating the intention for\nsolution step st). The situation of ipre\nt\nis used to re-\ntrieve kE = 8 examples Et from library L. Using\nthese kE high-quality insights as in-context exam-\nples, a refined insight it is generated. (3) Solution\nStep Generation: The solution step st is generated\nusing Ht\u22121 and it, then appended to Ht\u22121 to form\n\n\n\n\n\nHt. To signal the end of reasoning, st includes a\nfield indicating whether a confident answer to q has\nbeen reached.\n3\nConstruction of the Insight Library\nAs shown in Figure 2, we build the library of in-\nsights in two stages: initialization and filtering.\nInitialization: We use manually curated seed\nexamples S and a dataset DS containing questions\nand their chain-of-thought solutions. First, an LLM\nis prompted to split each solution in DS into 1\u20133\nsteps. The LLM is then prompted again to generate\nan insight it for each solution step st, consisting of\na situation, which should represents the reasoning\nstatus up to that step, and a goal, which should\noffers a purpose and a guideline to stimulate the\nLLM to reproduce solution step st. All insights and\ndivided solution steps are collected into an initial\nlibrary L0.\nFiltering: To identify high-quality insights, we\nuse a dataset DG (containing questions and ground-\ntruth answers) and a scoring mechanism: (1) For\neach insight ii \u2208L0, maintain counters ri (cor-\nrect uses) and wi (wrong uses). (2) Evaluate L0\nby running TBYS on each question q \u2208DG. For\neach reasoning step for q, retrieve kF = 25 exam-\nples from L0 and randomly select one as a 1-shot\nexample. If the reasoning yields a correct answer,\nincrement ri for each ii used; otherwise, incre-\nment wi. (3) Rank insights in L0 by the score\nri\nri+wi log(ri + wi), which balances accuracy and\nusage coverage. Select the top-kL examples to\nform L1. The insight library can be progressively\nimprove through multiple iterations. In each iter-\nation, the initial library L0 is updated to include\nthe filtered library L1 and the newly generated in-\nsights from dataset DG, which is produced during\nthe filtering of L1.\nIn our experiments, the MATH-500 dataset\n(Lightman et al., 2023) serves as DS and the test\nset, e.g., MATH-500 or AIME (Zhang et al., 2023a),\nserves as DG in a test-time adaptation (Jang et al.,\n2023) manner, with kL as a variable parameter.\n4\nRelated Work\nExtensive research has investigated prompt designs\nto improve LLM reasoning, including Chain-of-\nThought (Wei et al., 2022), Least-to-Most (Zhou\net al., 2023), Self-Consistency (Wang et al., 2023b),\nand Tree-of-Thoughts (Cao et al., 2023). Meth-\nods to enhance task-specific performance include\nquestion rephrasing, subtask decomposition, verifi-\ncation, and symbolic grounding (Lyu et al., 2023;\nXu et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023a; Zelikman et al.,\n2022; Wang et al., 2024); factuality and faithful-\nness checking for reasoning chains (Wang et al.,\n2024); and separating knowledge retrieval from\nreasoning (Jin et al., 2024).\nIterative prompting techniques rely on pre-\ndefined, hardcoded actions to guide reasoning,\nsuch as Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2023), IRCoT\n(Trivedi et al., 2023), iCAP (Wang et al., 2022),\nMetaGPT (Hong et al., 2024), and Chain of Ideas\n(Anonymous, 2024b).\nMemory-based methods include Buffer of\nThoughts (Yang et al., 2024c), which distills high-\nlevel guidelines from previously solved tasks and\nstores them in a buffer for future reuse. Skill-based\nCoT (Didolkar et al., 2024) predicts skill-based\nlabels for the questions. (Zhang et al., 2023b) iden-\ntifies key concepts in questions and uses inductive\nprompting templates to extract related concepts.\nrStar (Qi et al., 2024) employs a self-play mutual\nreasoning approach, augmented by Monte Carlo\nTree Search (MCTS) with a set of five reasoning-\ninducing prompts, to enhance reasoning.\nFinetuning-based methods, such as STaR (Zelik-\nman et al., 2022), ReST-MCTS (Zhang et al., 2024),\n1\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n# sampled reasonings\n0.525\n0.550\n0.575\n0.600\n0.625\n0.650\n0.675\nAccuracy\nSC\nTBYS+SC\nTBYS\nFigure 3: Performance comparison on MATH-500\n1\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n# sampled reasonings\n0.150\n0.175\n0.200\n0.225\n0.250\n0.275\nAccuracy\nSC\nTBYS+SC\nTBYS\nFigure 4: Performance comparison on AIME\n\nand AFlow (Anonymous, 2024a), demonstrate that\niterative training on reasoning histories and task-\nspecific workflows of correct answers enables mod-\nels to tackle increasingly complex problems.\n5\nExperiments\n5.1\nExperiment settings\nWe conducted experiments on two challenging\nmathematical datasets, AIME (Zhang et al., 2023a)\nand MATH-500 (Lightman et al., 2023). We com-\npare TBYS against a simple yet very strong base-\nline: 8-shot In-context Learning (Lu et al., 2022)\nwith Self-Consistency (Wang et al., 2023b).\nFor the experiments, use utilize the LLM\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024a) via the\nLLM API provided by Siliconflow (sil), with the\nfollowing configurations: max_tokens=1024, tem-\nperature=0.2, top_k=40, top_p=0.7, and n=1. The\nbge-large-en-v1.5 embedding model is employed\nfor insight retrieval. Results are reported as the\naverage across 8 experimental runs.\nSince coding benefits mathematical problems\n(Chen et al., 2023), when Python code blocks are\ndetected in the LLMs\u2019 responses, we invoke a cus-\ntomized sandboxed Python interpreter and append\nthe output to the code block.\n5.2\nComparison\nWhen compared with Self-Consistency (SC), TBYS\ndemonstrates comparable performance to SC using\n5 reasoning samples (SC@5) on MATH-500 (Fig-\nure 3) and SC@7 on AIME (Figure 4). The results\nfurther indicate that TBYS integrates effectively\nwith SC: TBYS+SC yields over 5% absolute gains\nin accuracy on MATH-500 and 7.5% on AIME.\n5.3\nOverhead Analysis\nTable 1: Cost comparison to SC under similar accuracy.\nMATH-500\nAcc.\nTime\nPrompt\nCompletion\nTBYS\n0.61\n52.82\n18163.80\n999.57\nSC@5\n0.61\n102.56\n13334.62\n2217.30\nAIME\nAcc.\nTime\nPrompt\nCompletion\nTBYS\n0.22\n78.15\n20686.23\n1559.60\nSC@7\n0.22\n322.79\n25,242.54\n7,102.49\nWe compare the overhead of TBYS with SC@5\non MATH-500 and with SC@7 on AIME, where\nthe methods achieve comparable accuracies. The\nmetrics analyzed include wall-time, number of\nprompt tokens, and completion tokens. As shown\nin Table 1, under similar accuracies, TBYS reduces\nwall-time and the number of completion tokens by\napproximately half on MATH-500 and one-third\non AIME. While TBYS uses 46% more prompt\ntokens on MATH-500, these can be cached and are\ntypically much cheaper and faster to predict than\ncompletion tokens. Since completion token counts\ntypically dominates runtime, our results show that\ncompletion token counts are consistently propor-\ntional to our runtime measurements across meth-\nods.\n5.4\nAblation Study\nTable 2: Ablation Study\nMATH-500\nAIME\nTBYS\n61.17%\n21.90%\n- Library Construction\n58.90%\n19.51%\n- Coding\n57.00%\n18.11%\n8-shot\n53.23%\n14.99%\nWe conducted ablation experiments by using\nthe raw insight library L0 as L1 (without filter-\ning, as described in Section 3). Accuracy declines\nwere observed in both datasets. Notably, we only\nperformed one round of insight filtering (i.e., us-\ning L = L1), and additional filtering rounds are\nexpected to further improve accuracy. Table 2 also\ndemonstrates that coding contributes half of the ac-\ncuracy gain compared to simple 8-shot prompting.\n5.5\nImpact of Library Size\n50\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\n900\n1000\nLibrary size\n0.590\n0.595\n0.600\n0.605\n0.610\nAccuracy on MATH-500\n0.20\n0.21\n0.22\n0.23\nAccuracy on AIME\nFigure 5: Impact of insight library size\nIn Section 3, we sorted the insight library L0 and\nselected the top-kL insights to form L1. Figure 5\nshows that on MATH-500, TBYS achieves peak\naccuracy with an insight library size of 50. On\nAIME, the optimal size is 500. Here, performance\ninitially improves as library size decreases due to\nthe filtering of lower-quality insights. However,\nas library size continue to decreases, excessively\n\nsmall libraries size reduces diversity in problem\ntypes and harms performance.\n6\nAdditional Comparison Experiments\nWe compare with Skill-based CoT (Didolkar et al.,\n2024), a prompt-guided interaction procedure that\nenables LLMs to assign skill labels to math ques-\ntions and perform ICL with label-specific exam-\nplars. We also conducted experiments using a k-\nwait approach, where we append \u201cWait, \u201d after the\nmodel completion and let the LLM to continue its\ngeneration for k times. Below are the comparison\nresults.\nTable 3: Comparison to Skill-based CoT and k-wait.\nMethod\nAcc.\nk-shot CoT\n54.30%\nSkill-based CoT\n60.52%\nk-wait (k=1)\n55.00%\nk-wait (k=2)\n56.60%\nk-wait (k=3)\n54.20%\nTBYS (Ours)\n61.99%\nResults in Figure 3 shown that TBYS is slight\nbetter than Skill-based CoT, which is task-specific,\nand is much better than k-wait.\n7\nQualitative Analysis of Insight Quality\nWe provide qualitative analysis of the insights us-\ning two selected examples. These problems are\nrelatively simple, but where k-shot reasoning fails.\nWe use these examples to illustrate how TBYS\u2019s\ninsights effectively steer its multi-step reasoning\nprocesses.\nThe first example in Figure 6 asks to convert\n21\n22\u00b757 to a terminating decimal. TBYS solves the\nproblem in two steps, with the goals of the insights\nbeing \u201censure the denominator is a power of 10\u201d\nand \u201cSimplify the numerator and express the frac-\ntion as a terminating decimal\u201d.\nThe second example in Figure 7 asks to solve the\nquestion:\nq\nx + \u221a3x + 6 +\nq\nx \u2212\u221a3x + 6 = 6.\nTBYS solves the problem in two steps, with the,\nwith the goals of the insights being \u201csimplify the\nequation by squaring both sides to remove the\nsquare roots\u201d and \u201cfind the value of x by substitu-\ntion\u201d.\nBoth examples demonstrate that TBYS gener-\nates suitable insights for their respective problems.\n8\nConclusion and Future Work\nThis paper introduces a novel proactive prompting\nparadigm, instantiates it with the simple TBYS\nreasoning framework, and verifies the effectiveness\nof TBYS on challenging advanced mathematics\nreasoning tasks.\nPromising directions for future improvement\ninclude: Automated search for optimal insights\n(Yang et al., 2024b); integration of long-term mem-\nory mechanisms (Tang et al.; Anonymous, 2025);\nenhancement of programming capabilities (Chen\net al., 2023); enforcement of structured inference\nprocesses (Li et al., 2025b; Cao et al., 2023).\nLimitations\nOur method incurs higher computational overhead\ncompared to direct prompting, a common drawback\namong advanced prompting techniques that involve\nscaling test-time inference.\nDue to time and financial constraints (our cur-\nrent experiments take about 50 days with single-\nthreaded API calls), we only evaluated the pro-\nposed method on two math-domain datasets using\na single LLM.\nEthical Statement\nThis work fully adheres to the ACL Ethics Policy.\nTo the best of our knowledge, no ethical issues are\nassociated with this research.\nReferences\nhttps://siliconflow.cn/.\nAnonymous. 2024a.

Yen Fellow, IEEE, Junchi Yan Senior Member, IEEE\nAbstract\u2014For Large Language Models (LLMs), a disconnect\npersists between benchmark performance and real-world utility.\nCurrent evaluation frameworks remain fragmented, prioritizing\ntechnical metrics while neglecting holistic assessment for deploy-\nment. This survey introduces an anthropomorphic evaluation\nparadigm through the lens of human intelligence, proposing a\nnovel three-dimensional taxonomy: Intelligence Quotient (IQ)-\nGeneral Intelligence for foundational capacity, Emotional Quo-\ntient (EQ)-Alignment Ability for value-based interactions, and\nProfessional Quotient (PQ)-Professional Expertise for specialized\nproficiency. For practical value, we pioneer a Value-oriented\nEvaluation (VQ) framework assessing economic viability, social\nimpact, ethical alignment, and environmental sustainability. Our\nmodular architecture integrates six components with an imple-\nmentation roadmap. Through analysis of 200+ benchmarks, we\nidentify key challenges including dynamic assessment needs and\ninterpretability gaps. It provides actionable guidance for devel-\noping LLMs that are technically proficient, contextually relevant,\nand ethically sound. We maintain a curated repository of open-\nsource evaluation resources at: https://github.com/onejune2018/\nAwesome-LLM-Eval.\nImpact Statement\u2014As LLMs rapidly transition from research\nprototypes to real-world applications, the field faces a fundamen-\ntal disconnect between benchmark performance and practical\nutility. Current evaluation practices remain fragmented, prioritiz-\ning isolated technical metrics while neglecting the developmental\ntrajectory of LLM capabilities and their broader societal implica-\ntions. This review addresses this critical gap by introducing an an-\nthropomorphic evaluation paradigm that maps LLM assessment\nto human cognitive progression, through a novel four-dimensional\nIQ-EQ-PQ-VQ taxonomy. Crucially, our framework establishes\nthe first comprehensive roadmap that reveals how evaluation\ndimensions correspond to LLMs\u2019 developmental stages: IQ (pre-\ntraining knowledge acquisition), PQ (supervised fine-tuning ex-\npertise), EQ (reinforcement alignment), and VQ (value-oriented\nimpact). This work provides not merely an assessment tool but a\nstrategic compass for navigating the rapidly evolving landscape\nof AI evaluation. The roadmap enables stakeholders to anticipate\nfuture challenges while selecting context-appropriate evaluation\nstrategies across the model lifecycle.\nIndex Terms\u2014Large Language Models, Evaluation, Bench-\nmark.\nI.

This ongoing explo-\nration aims to define, assess, and expand the boundaries of\nhuman intellect [1]. Contemporarily, the rise of machine intel-\nligence, especially LLMs within natural language processing\n(NLP), has introduced a new dimension to this inquiry [2, 3].\nThese LLMs show remarkable capabilities in understanding\nand generating language, thereby prompting a critical need for\neffective measures and evaluation frameworks to gauge their\nlevel with respect to human intelligence [4, 5]. Formerly, the\nNLP community relied on simple benchmark tests to evaluate\nlanguage models, focusing primarily on aspects like grammar\nand vocabulary. As the field progressed, more sophisticated\nbenchmarks emerged, such as the MUC evaluations [6], which\nconcentrated on information extraction. With the advent of\ndeep learning, the landscape further evolved, incorporating\ncomprehensive benchmarks like SNLI [7], SQuAD [8] and\nDROP [9], which not only assessed performance but also\nprovided substantial training data.\nParticularly, the emergence of large-scale pre-trained lan-\nguage models, such as BERT [2], marked a paradigm shift, ne-\ncessitating the development of new evaluation methodologies.\nThis led to a proliferation of shared tasks and challenges, in-\ncluding SemEval [10], CoNLL [11], GLUE [12], SuperGLUE\n[13], and XNLI [14]. These initiatives facilitated a holistic\nassessment of model performance, fostering continuous im-\nprovement in evaluation techniques.\nAs LLMs have grown in size and capability, they have\ndemonstrated impressive performance in both zero-shot and\nfew-shot scenarios, often rivaling fine-tuned models [1]. This\nhas led to a transition from task-specific benchmarks to more\ngeneral capability assessments, blurring the lines between\ndistinct downstream applications. The rising benchmarks are\ndesigned to evaluate a wide range of abilities without relying\non extensive training data, thus providing a more comprehen-\nsive evaluation under limited-shot conditions [12, 15, 16].\nThere is a need for rigorous and multifaceted evaluations\nnot only assessing the capabilities but also ensuring alignment\nwith human values and preferences. Pinpointing the limitations\nin existing evaluation techniques and devising approaches to\novercome these hurdles is crucial. Nevertheless, the evaluation\nof LLMs is a multifaceted and resource - demanding endeavor,\nencompassing numerous dimensions and facets. Several recent\nreviews [17, 18] have examined the assessment of LLMs,\nyet their focus has been predominantly on benchmark tasks,\narXiv:2508.18646v1  [cs.AI]  26 Aug 2025\n\n2\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021\ndatasets, and evaluation metrics, with a lack of in-depth in-\nvestigation. Such an omission may compromise the validity of\nthe evaluation process, as it overlooks crucial aspects such as\npractical applicability and interpretability. In an effort to bridge\nthis gap, this paper integrates practical discourse to tackle\nthe foundational challenges and limitations inherent in LLM\nevaluations that arise from varied evaluation configurations.\n1.

Conclusions\nFig. 1: Overview of contents of this paper (zoom in).\nRecent efforts have proposed taxonomies for evaluating\nLLMs. Specifically, [17] categorizes evaluations into knowl-\nedge, alignment, and safety, and [19] focuses on general\ntaxonomies that prioritize abstract categorization, these frame-\nworks often lack granularity in addressing domain-specific\nproficiency and human-centric practicality. Noteworthily, [20]\nreveal that the sampling mechanism of LLMs in decision-\nmaking exhibits a descriptive and prescriptive pattern akin\nto human. This enlightens an anthropomorphic perspective,\nallowing for a more intuitive and comprehensive assessment\nacross scenarios.\nAs a potential road map to address these limitations, we\nobserve a profound correspondence between LLM evaluation\ndimensions and the model\u2019s developmental trajectory that\nmirrors human cognitive progression. As shown in Fig. 2, the\nproposed anthropomorphic framework naturally emerges from\nthe three-stage training paradigm defining modern LLM de-\nvelopment: Intelligence Quotient (IQ)-General Intelligence:\nCorresponds to capabilities developed during pre-training,\nwhere models acquire foundational knowledge through self-\nsupervised learning on massive corpora. IQ quantifies rea-\nsoning ability and world knowledge breadth, analogous to\nhuman cognitive foundations. Professional Quotient (PQ)-\nProfessional Expertise: Emerges from supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT), where models develop task-specific proficiency through\ninstruction-response pairs. PQ measures specialized capabili-\nties across diverse application domains. Emotional Quotient\n(EQ)-Alignment Ability: Cultivated through post-training\nreinforcement learning (RL), where models learn to align\noutputs with human values. EQ assesses emotional and eth-\nical resonance with human preferences beyond mere task\ncompletion. Unlike broad \u2019knowledge\u2019 dimension in [19],\nour IQ evaluation explicitly quantifies foundational reason-\ning and world knowledge breadth, while PQ introduces a\nstructured evaluation of task-specific expertise, which existing\nframeworks neglect. Furthermore, EQ extends beyond [17]\u2019s\nsafety-centric alignment to encompass emotional and ethical\nalignment with human values, ensuring outputs resonate with\nuser preferences and societal norms.\nEarly stages of LLM evaluation mainly focus on IQ, en-\nsuring that the models had a broad base of world knowledge.\nAs pre-training techniques and data engineering matured, the\nemphasis shifted to PQ, evaluating the model\u2019s ability to solve\nspecific practical tasks. Now, as models become proficient in\nthese tasks, EQ has become increasingly important. For IQ\nand PQ, there are well-established benchmarks such as MMLU\n[16], GPQA [21], MATHQA[22] for IQ, and HumanEval [23],\nIFEval [24] for domain-specific PQ. For EQ, while there are\nno strict benchmarks, tools like Alignbench [25], MT-Bench\n[26], and Arena-Hard [27] provide some coverage, though\nthey often use third-party AI as evaluators, making them more\naligned with AI preferences than human preferences.\nAs depicted in Fig. 1, this review transcends conventional\nLLM evaluation paradigms by introducing a transformative\nframework, that bridges the critical gap between technical\nperformance metrics and real-world societal impact. We pi-\noneer an anthropomorphic evaluation taxonomy that funda-\nmentally reimagines how we assess LLM capabilities, moving\nbeyond fragmented benchmarks toward a holistic roadmap\nunderstanding of AI intelligence. Our work establishes the first\ncomprehensive bridge between machine cognition and human-\ncentric value systems, positioning the evaluation not merely as\na technical exercise but as a crucial determinant of responsible\nAI deployment.

The anthropomorphic\nevaluation framework: IQ-EQ-PQ taxonomy with evolutionary correspondence to LLM training stages. Intelligence Quotient (IQ)-General\nIntelligence denotes knowledge capacity acquired by pre-training, reflecting foundational reasoning and world knowledge breadth. Professional\nQuotient (PQ)-Professional Expertise represents task capability developed through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), measuring proficiency in\nspecialized domains. Emotional Quotient (EQ)-Alignment Ability represents human preference alignment achieved through RL post-training,\nencompassing emotional and ethical resonance with human values.\nstructure not only maps the current landscape with un-\nprecedented precision, but also reveals hidden intercon-\nnections between seemingly disparate evaluation tech-\nniques, exposing critical gaps that have hindered the de-\nvelopment of truly comprehensive assessment protocols.\n\u2022 Anthropomorphic Intelligence Framework: Breaking\nfree from the limitations of single-dimensional evalua-\ntions, we introduce a paradigm-shifting anthropomorphic\nframework that conceptualizes LLM capabilities through\nthe lens of human intelligence. Our tripartite IQ-EQ-\nPQ model (Intelligence Quotient, Emotional Quotient,\nand Professional Quotient) represents the first holistic\napproach (to our best knowledge) that simultaneously\ncaptures what LLMs know, how they apply knowledge,\nand why their outputs resonate with human values. This\nframework transforms evaluation from a technical check-\nlist into a meaningful assessment of AI\u2019s alignment with\nhuman cognitive and social structures.\n\u2022 Pioneering Value-Oriented Evaluation (VQ): We estab-\nlish the foundational principles for Value Quotient (VQ)\nassessment\u2014the first systematic methodology to quantify\nLLMs\u2019 broader societal impact beyond technical metrics.\nBy integrating economic viability, ethical alignment, so-\ncial responsibility, and environmental sustainability into a\nunified evaluation framework, we shift the discourse from\n\"can it work?\" to \"should it work?\" and \"how does it\nbenefit society?\" This represents a critical evolution from\ncapability-focused assessment to value-driven evaluation.\n\u2022 Practical Implementation Blueprint: Beyond theoret-\nical constructs, we deliver an actionable, step-by-step\nand modular evaluation system that bridges the chasm\nbetween academic research and industrial deployment.\nOur evaluation framework addresses the critical discon-\nnect between benchmark performance and real-world\nfunctionality, providing concrete strategies for evaluat-\ning LLMs within complex application ecosystems (RAG\nsystems, agents, chatbots) while accounting for the full\nlifecycle of model deployment and maintenance.\n\u2022 Future-Proof Evaluation Roadmap: We articulate a\nsix-tiered evolutionary path for LLM evaluation that\nanticipates the field\u2019s trajectory over the next decade.\nThis forward-looking perspective identifies not just cur-\nrent limitations but also the emerging challenges at the\nintersection of statistical rigor, interpretability, user expe-\nrience, system reliability, dynamic adaptation, and value\ncreation\u2014providing a strategic compass for navigating\nthe rapidly evolving landscape of AI assessment.\nII.

By analyzing these tools, we can\nbetter understand their strengths and limitations, providing\nrecommendations for future improvements and deployments.\nThe comprehensive analysis of these LLM evaluation har-\nnesses reveals a spectrum of strengths and weaknesses across\nseveral critical dimensions. When it comes to ease of use,\nsome platforms like OpenCompass and Azure AI Studio stand\nout for their user-friendly interfaces, streamlining the process\nfor both novice and experienced researchers. However, the\nmodularity of these tools varies; FlagEval and Weights &\nBiases offer high levels of customization, allowing users to\nintegrate specific components as needed, which is particularly\nbeneficial for complex or specialized research projects.\nExplainability, with Arthur Bench and LangSmith provides\nrobust mechanisms to interpret model behavior, an essential\naspect for ensuring transparency and trust in AI systems. In\nterms of reproducibility, most of the listed tools, including\nSuperCLUE and DeepEval, ensure that experiments can be\nreliably replicated, which is fundamental for the scientific\nmethod. The open-source nature of many of these tools, such\nas DeepEval and Parea AI, fosters a collaborative environment.\nThe richness of the metrics provided by these evaluation\nharnesses is also noteworthy. While some, like Arthur Bench\nand TruLens, offer a wide array of detailed performance\nindicators, others may focus on a more limited but still\ninformative set. Multi-task support is another area where\nthere\u2019s a significant difference, with Azure AI Studio and\nAmazon Bedrock excelling in handling a broad range of tasks,\nfrom natural language understanding to generation, thereby\nproviding a more holistic assessment of LLMs.\nSpeed and efficiency testing are crucial for practical ap-\nplications, yet not all toolkits include this feature. Tools like\nAzure AI Studio and Vertex AI Studio incorporate speed\nand resource efficiency evaluations, which are vital for real-\nworld deployment considerations. Lastly, the ability to assess\nalignment and instruction following, an increasingly important\naspect of LLMs, is present in select platforms, such as Arthur\nBench and Prompt Flow, which provide insights into how\nwell models adhere to human values and follow specific\ninstructions, a critical consideration for safe and effective AI.\nOverall, the landscape of LLM evaluation harnesses is\ndiverse, with each tool offering a different balance of features.\nResearchers and developers must carefully consider their spe-\ncific needs and the characteristics of the available tools when\nselecting the most appropriate one for their work. By lever-\naging the strengths of these platforms, the field can continue\nto advance the quality, reliability, and applicability of LLMs,\ncontributing to the broader goals of artificial intelligence.\na) Task Support and Diversity of Objectives: The ex-\nisting evaluation tools cover a wide array of tasks, including\ndirect assessment, pairwise ranking, question-answering, sum-\nmarization, translation, and code generation. This diversity\nreflects the complexity and variability of real-world appli-\ncations. For instance, Arthur Bench supports multiple task\n\nSHELL et al.: A SAMPLE ARTICLE USING IEEETRAN.CLS FOR IEEE JOURNALS\n5\ntypes, such as QA, summarization, and translation, making\nit a versatile evaluation platform. Additionally, many tools\nallow users to customize tasks, for instance, athina-evals and\nPandaLM, which is valuable for specific research or industrial\napplications.\nb) Usability and Community Activity: Usability is a\ncritical factor in determining the widespread adoption of an\nevaluation tool. The table indicates that most tools have\nachieved high standards of usability, with intuitive interfaces\nand documentation. For example, LightEval and autoevals\nare noted for their high usability, providing straightforward\naccess for users. Some tools also integrate automated processes\nto further simplify the evaluation workflow. Prompt flow\nby Microsoft, for instance, aims to enhance product quality\nthrough simplified development processes.\nCommunity activity is another key indicator. High activ-\nity typically means continuous support and updates, along\nwith a strong user base contributing feedback and improve-\nments. Projects like EVAL (OpenAI) and lm-evaluation-\nharness (EleutherAI) exhibit strong community engagement,\nwhich not only drives the iterative improvement of the tools\nbut also provides a wealth of resources and support for users.\nB. Implementation Roadmap of Modular Evaluation System\nA modular LLM evaluation framework or harness in general\nconsists of: benchmark or dataset hub, model hub, prompting\nmodule, metrics, monitoring and experiment management,\narena or leaderboard (as shown in Fig. 3).\nThe evaluation framework leverages distinct modules, delin-\neating three primary paradigms: metrics-centered assessment,\nhuman-centered assessment (Human Judgment), and model-\ncentered peer review (LLMs as Evaluators). In the metrics-\ncentered assessment paradigm, task-specific performance in-\ndicators\u2014such as F1 score, Exact Match, and Perplexity\n[31]\u2014are commonly employed to ascertain the accuracy of\ngenerated outputs, particularly in classification-oriented tasks.\nThe human-centered assessment approach emphasizes hu-\nman\u2019s qualitative analysis of LLM-generated content, focusing\non attributes like clarity, coherence, and factual correctness\n[32]. Notably, there has been a surge in interest towards human\nevaluations utilizing the Elo rating system [33], which offers\na structured methodology for comparative assessment. Since\nhuman evaluations are time-consuming, using model-centered\npeer review (LLMs as Evaluators) has become a popular\nalternative for assessing model performance. [34].\n1) Benchmark or Dataset Hub: It is crucial to select appro-\npriate benchmark datasets that accurately reflect the models\u2019\ncapabilities. Analogous to human intelligence, LLM abilities\ncan be classified into three interrelated dimensions: General\nIntelligence (IQ, Intelligence Quotient), Alignment Ability\n(EQ, Emotional Quotient), and Professional Expertise (PQ,\nProfessional Quotient). Correspondingly, benchmark datasets\nare categorized into general capability benchmarks, alignment\nbenchmarks, and domain-specific benchmarks. General capa-\nbility benchmarks serve as foundational assessments, often\nemployed at the time of an LLM\u2019s release to gauge its\nbroad-spectrum performance (e.g., MMLU [35], HumanEval\n[36]). Domain-specific benchmarks focus on specialized areas,\nevaluating LLMs\u2019 proficiency in particular fields such as\ntelecommunications with TeleQnA [37]. Furthermore, align-\nment benchmarks scrutinize LLMs\u2019 adherence to diverse tasks\nand ethical guidelines, exemplified by AlignBench [25]. Addi-\ntional benchmarks like FOFO [38] assess specific competen-\ncies, such as format-following capabilities. Detailed descrip-\ntions of each category are provided in Section III.\n2) Model Hub: This section provides insights into various\nmodels, ensuring a fair evaluation by mitigating risks such\nas data contamination and avoiding biased comparisons. It\naddresses considerations for selecting models based on their\ntraining methodologies, access to external resources, and fine-\ntuning on specific benchmarks versus pre-training only.\n3) Prompting Module: After selecting suitable benchmarks\nand models, the subsequent step involves designing prompts\nand configuring decoding parameters for response generation.\nIn the prompt design phase, decisions are made regarding the\ntype of prompting strategy\u2014whether zero-shot, few-shot, or\nchain-of-thought\u2014to employ. The configuration of decoding\nparameters, including temperature settings, plays a critical\nrole in optimizing model output. Proper setup ensures that\nthe evaluation not only tests the LLM\u2019s inherent capabilities\nbut also its adaptability under varying conditions.\n4) Metrics Module: The evaluation of LLMs necessitates\nthe selection of appropriate metrics that align with specific\napplications and intended use cases. Given the broad spec-\ntrum of LLM applications, from machine translation and\ntext summarization to conversational agents, the choice of\nevaluation metrics would be beneficial to not only reflect\ntechnical performance, but also be closely tied to business\nneeds and application contexts. An effective evaluation frame-\nwork allows researchers and developers to gain deep insights\ninto the strengths and limitations of LLMs, guiding further\nimprovements and optimizations. The evaluation requires a\ndual focus on technical performance and business impact.\nTechnical metrics assess the model\u2019s linguistic and functional\ncapabilities, while business metrics measure user engagement,\noperational efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.\n(1) Technical Metrics: The choice of metrics would be closely\naligned with the application. For instance, in machine trans-\nlation, where the goal is to generate translations that are both\naccurate and fluent, metrics such as BLEU [39] and METEOR\n[40] have been widely adopted. These token overlap-based\nmetrics measure the n-gram overlap between the generated\ntext and the reference, providing an indication of how well\nthe model\u2019s output matches human-generated translations. In\ncontrast, for tasks like sentiment analysis, precision, recall, and\nF1 score become more relevant, as they focus on the model\u2019s\nability to correctly classify the sentiment of a given text.\nConsidering the diverse range of LLM applications\u2014from\nmachine translation and summarization to dialogue systems\nand code generation\u2014it is essential to adopt a multi-layered\nevaluation framework that reflects the linguistic phenomena at\nplay. Table II presents a taxonomy of technical metrics for\nLLM evaluation, organized into five broad levels: (1) Lexical\nand Morphological, (2) Syntactic, (3) Semantic, (4) Pragmatic\nand Discourse, and (5) Factuality and Explainability.\n\n6\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021\nModel Hub\nData Hub\nMetrics\nLlama2\nDeepSeek\nClaude\nQwen\nchatGLM\nBLOOM\nYi\nGPT\nMixtral\nGemini\nMamba\n...\nMMLU\nBBH\nARC-C\nTruthfulQA\nGPQA\nMATH\nGSM8K\nHumanEval\nMBPP\nIFEval\n...\nAnnotator\nEvaluator\nJudge\nAnalyst\nTester\nEngineer\nData Cleaner\n...\nAccuracy\nPrecision\nRecall\nBLEU\nROUGE\nPerplexity\nFairness\nRelevance\nRobustness\nRejection\nThroughput\n...\nTask-oriented \nRole-oriented \nZero-shot \nFew-shot\nCoT\nExpert \nprompting \nEmotionPrompt\nGenerated \nknowledge\n...\nSentiment \nanalysis\nNLG\nNLU \nKnowledge \nReading \ncomprehension \nTranslation\nMath \nReasoning\nAlgorithm\n....\nMonitoring\nVisualization\nBenchmark\nRanking\nExperiments\nManagement\nStatistics\nContext \nWindow\n...\nHumans\nTasks\nAnalysis\nChatbot Arena\nAgentBench\nCompassRank\nOpen LLM \nLeaderboard\nLLMEval\nSuperBench\nToolBench\n...\nLeaderboards\nc\nPrompting\nFig. 3: Typology of the LLM Evaluation Modules.\nLexical and Morphological Metrics: These metrics focus\non token- or character-level correspondence and morphological\nvariation. Traditional n-gram overlap measures such as BLEU\n[39] and ROUGE-N/L [41] quantify the proportion of exact\ncontiguous matches between hypothesis and reference, while\nedit-distance scores like Translation Error Rate (TER) gauge\nthe minimal sequence of insertions, deletions, and substitutions\nrequired to transform one string into another. Complement-\ning these, word-order distances\u2014including RIBES [42] and\nKendall\u2019s \u03c4 \u2014penalize token reordering, providing insight\ninto the impact of syntactic shifts on surface similarity. For\ntasks sensitive to finer-grained discrepancies, character error\nrate (CER) and word error rate (WER) compute the frequen-\ncies of low-level insertion, deletion, and substitution errors,\nas commonly used in ASR and OCR evaluation. Subword-\noverlap metrics such as chrF [43] and BPE-F1 further refine\nthis analysis by measuring similarity over character n-grams\nor byte-pair encoded segments, thus capturing partial matches\nthat evade pure token-level statistics.\nSyntactic Metrics: it assesses the preservation of grammat-\nical structure and targeted syntactic phenomena. Constituency\nand dependency parse-tree matching metrics\u2014PARSEVAL\n[44] precision, recall, and F1 for bracket structures, along-\nside Unlabeled and Labeled Attachment Scores (UAS/LAS)\n[45] for dependency relations\u2014offer a principled basis for\ncomparing predicted and gold parses. To probe a model\u2019s\ncommand of specific constructions, targeted syntactic eval-\nuation frameworks such as Targeted Syntactic Evaluation\n(TSE) [46] deploy minimal-pair sentences to test capabilities\nlike subject\u2013verb agreement, while syntactic tree-edit distance\nmeasures the minimal sequence of tree operations to align\ntwo parse trees, yielding a granular account of structural\ndivergence.\nSemantic Metrics: At semantic level, evaluation em-\nphasizes\nmeaning\npreservation,\ninference,\nand\nfidelity.\nEmbedding-based approaches\u2014BERTScore [47], MoverScore\n[48], BLEURT [49], COMET [50], and similar meth-\nods\u2014leverage contextualized vectors extracted from pre-\ntrained models to compute cosine similarities or Earth Mover\u2019s\ndistances, thus capturing nuanced semantic alignment between\nhypothesis and reference. Entailment-driven metrics such as\nthe Document-Aware Entailment model (DAE) [51] treats\nthe generation task as a natural language inference problem,\nclassifying whether outputs are entailed by, neutral to, or con-\ntradictory with source texts. Question-answering frameworks,\nincluding QuestEval [52] and QAFactEval [53], automatically\ngenerate questions from the source or candidate summary and\ncompare model-predicted answers to gold responses, thereby\nquantifying semantic fidelity via answer accuracy. Specialized\nLLM-based judges\u2014either prompt-based few-shot evaluators\nor fine-tuned discrimination models\u2014have emerged as learn-\nable arbiters of output quality, scoring on dimensions such as\nfactuality, coherence, and naturalness [54].\nPragmatic and Discourse Metrics: The metrics in this part\ncapture coherence, cohesion, style, and diversity across larger\ntextual spans. Entity Grid models [55] track the distribution\nand syntactic roles of discourse entities across sentences\nto quantify thematic coherence, while Rhetorical Structure\nTheory (RST) tree comparisons [56] evaluate whether logical\nand rhetorical relations are preserved. Readability and stylistic\nconsistency are measured by indices such as Flesch\u2013Kincaid\nreadability tests [57] combine sentence length and word\ncomplexity into difficulty scores, alongside formality and\nsentiment metrics [58] that assess register and affective tone.\nTo detect degeneracy and encourage lexical variety, diversity\nmeasures like distinct-n [59] compute the proportion of unique\nn-grams in the generated text, whereas [60] quantify the\nrecurrence of identical n-grams within and across sentences.\nFactuality & Explainability Metrics: Factual consistency\nmetrics such as FactCC [61] verify whether key propositions\nin the generated output align with source material. Calibra-\ntion and uncertainty metrics, including Expected Calibration\nError (ECE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), measure\ndiscrepancies between predicted probabilities and observed\naccuracy, while entropy-based measures of predictive and\nsemantic uncertainty signal where the model is least confident.\nBy selecting and combining technical metrics, we can gain\na deeper understanding of models\u2019 strengths and weaknesses,\nleading to more informed decisions in the development and\ndeployment of LLMs. Future work may focus on developing\nmore sophisticated and context-aware metrics that can better\ncapture the nuances of natural language, thus bridging the gap\nbetween automatic evaluations and human judgment.\n(2) Business Metrics: Evaluating a system\u2019s performance and\nimpact on business is multifaceted. The metrics used to gauge\nthe success of an LLM application can be broadly categorized\n\nSHELL et al.: A SAMPLE ARTICLE USING IEEETRAN.CLS FOR IEEE JOURNALS\n7\nTABLE II: Basic Metrics Taxonomy for LLM Evaluation (Technical vs. Business).\nDimension\nCategory\nMetric\nDescription / Use-case\nTechnical\nLexical &\nMorphological\nBLEU [39]\nPrecision-based n-gram overlap (0\u20131); \u2191is better.\nROUGE-N/L [41]\nRecall-oriented n-gram (N) and LCS-based (L) overlap.\nMETEOR [40]\nUnigram alignment with synonymy/stemming; harmonic mean.\nTER\nTranslation Edit Rate via edit distance.\nchrF [43]\nCharacter n-gram F-score for finer-grained matching.\nSyntactic\nPARSEVAL [44]\nConstituency precision/recall/F1 on parse trees.\nUAS / LAS [45]\nUnlabeled / Labeled dependency attachment scores.\nTSE [46]\nTargeted syntactic evaluation via minimal-pair sentences.\nSemantic\nBERTScore [47]\nContextual-embedding cosine similarity (BERT/RoBERTa).\nMoverScore [48]\nEarth Mover\u2019s Distance on contextual embeddings.\nCOMET [50]\nLearned metric using cross-lingual embeddings.\nQuestEval [52]\nQA-based semantic fidelity assessment.\nPragmatics & Discourse\nEntity Grid [55]\nEntity transition coherence modeling.\ndistinct-n [59]\nLexical diversity via unique n-gram ratio.\nFlesch-Kincaid [57]\nReadability via sentence/word complexity.\nFactuality &\nExplainability\nFactCC [61]\nFactual consistency via source alignment.\nECE / MCE [62]\nExpected / Maximum calibration error for confidence.\nBLANC [63]\nReference-less metric using masked LM.\nBusiness\nUser Engagement\nVisited\nCount of unique users accessing the LLM interface.\nSubmitted\nRatio of users who submit prompts vs. total visitors.\nResponded\nProportion of error-free system outputs delivered.\nViewed\nFrequency of users viewing generated responses.\nClicks\nNumber of reference-document clicks from outputs.\nInteraction\nUser acceptance rate\nContext-specific adoption (e.g., thumbs-up, text reuse).\nLLM conversation\nMean dialogue sessions per user.\nActive days\nDistinct days each user interacts with the LLM.\nInteraction timing\nAvg. prompt-to-response latency + dwell time.\nResponse Quality\nPrompt / response length\nAvg. tokens in queries and replies.\nEdit distance\nTextual delta between prompt and generated output.\nFeedback & Retention\nUser feedback\nVolume of up/down votes or explicit ratings.\nDAU / WAU / MAU\nDaily/Weekly/Monthly Active Users.\nUser return rate\n% of prior-period users who return.\nPerformance\nRequests per second\nPeak sustained throughput (concurrency).\nTokens per second\nStreaming generation speed.\nTime to first token\nLatency p50/p95 from query to first byte.\nError rate\nFraction of failed requests (auth, rate-limit, etc.).\nReliability\nSuccess-to-total request ratio.\nLatency\nEnd-to-end response time (avg / p95 / p99).\nCost\nGPU / CPU utilization\nResource efficiency (tokens per GPU-hour).\nLLM API cost\nThird-party token or query charges.\nInfrastructure cost\nStorage, bandwidth, compute amortization.\nOperation cost\nMaintenance, security, support staff spend.\ninto several key areas: user engagement and utility, user\ninteraction, quality of response, user feedback and retention,\nperformance, and cost. Each category provides insights into\nthe operational efficiency and user experience.\nUser Engagement and Utility Metrics: Both are funda-\nmental in assessing the initial attractiveness and usability of an\nLLM application. These metrics include the number of users\nwho visited the LLM app feature, submitted prompts, received\nresponses without errors, viewed responses, and clicked on\nreference documentation provided by the LLM. A high rate\nof visits and submissions indicates a strong interest and active\nuse of the LLM, while the absence of errors and the viewing of\nresponses suggest that the LLM is providing value to its users.\nClicks on reference documentation can also indicate that the\nLLM is effectively guiding users towards additional resources,\nenhancing their overall experience.\nUser Interaction Metrics: These metrics delve deeper into\nhow users engage with the LLM over time. The frequency of\nuser acceptance, the average number of LLM conversations\nper user, the number of active days using LLM features, and\nthe average interaction timing all provide a comprehensive\nview of user behavior. For instance, a higher user acceptance\nrate, especially in conversational scenarios, suggests that the\nLLM is meeting or exceeding user expectations. Monitoring\nthe average number of conversations and active days can help\nidentify power users and potential areas for improvement.\nInteraction timing, including the latency between prompts\nand responses, is crucial for ensuring that the LLM remains\nresponsive and engaging.\nResponse Quality Metrics : This is paramount for main-\ntaining user trust and satisfaction. Average lengths of prompts\nand responses, as well as edit distance metrics, offer quanti-\ntative measures of the LLM\u2019s ability to generate coherent and\nrelevant content. Edit distance metrics, in particular, can serve\nas an indicator of the degree of customization and refinement\nin the LLM\u2019s output, reflecting its adaptability to user needs.\nHigh-quality responses not only improve user experience but\nalso contribute to the LLM\u2019s reputation and credibility.\nFeedback and Retention Metrics: Direct feedback like\nthumbs up/down ratings, is invaluable for understanding user\nsentiment and making data-driven improvements. Additionally,\ntracking daily, weekly, and monthly active users, along with\nuser return rate, helps in assessing the stickiness of the LLM\napplication. A high return rate indicates that the LLM is\ndelivering consistent value, encouraging users to continue\nusing. Analyzing these metrics can guide the development of\nstrategies to enhance user retention and satisfaction.\nPerformance Metrics: Performance metrics are essential\n\n8\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021\nfor ensuring that the LLM operates efficiently and reliably.\nAs supported in LLMPerf, key performance indicators include\nrequests per second (concurrency), tokens per second, time to\nfirst token render, error rates, reliability, and latency. These\nmetrics provide a practical overview of the LLM\u2019s capabilities,\nhelping to identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization. For\nexample, a low error rate and high reliability are indicative of\na robust and stable system, while minimizing latency ensures\na smooth and responsive user experience.\nCost Metrics: GPU/CPU utilization, LLM calls cost, in-\nfrastructure cost, and operation cost all contribute to the total\ncost of ownership. By monitoring these costs, organizations\ncan make informed decisions about resource allocation and\nscaling. For instance, optimizing GPU/CPU utilization can\nlead to cost savings, while carefully managing infrastructure\nand operation costs ensures LLMs economically viable.\nA comprehensive evaluation of an LLM system requires a\nbalanced approach that considers both qualitative and quanti-\ntative aspects. By leveraging the metrics outlined in Table II,\nbusinesses can gain a holistic understanding of their LLM\u2019s\nperformance, enabling them to continuously refine and im-\nprove the service to meet the evolving needs of their users.\n5) Tasks Module: The Tasks Module is a critical compo-\nnent within the evaluation framework for LLMs, designed to\nsystematically assess model performance across a wide array\nof tasks. This module aims to provide a comprehensive and\ndiverse set of challenges that can effectively evaluate various\naspects of LLM capabilities, including language understand-\ning, reasoning, and generation, etc. The selection of tasks is\ncrucial as it directly influences the breadth and depth of the\nevaluation, guaranteeing that models undergo evaluation in\nsituations closely resembling practical applications.\nTo achieve this goal, the Tasks Module incorporates both\nconventional and innovative tasks. Conventional tasks include\nthose found in established benchmarks such as GLUE [12],\nwhich focus on natural language understanding. However,\nrecognizing the limitations of these benchmarks, newer frame-\nworks like BIG-bench [64] have expanded the scope to include\nmore complex and varied challenges. These tasks are designed\nto push the boundaries of what LLMs can do, thereby identi-\nfying areas where further improvements are needed.\nMoreover, the Tasks Module emphasizes the importance of\nreal-world applicability. For instance, HELM [54] introduces\na hierarchical categorization framework which spans 16 dis-\ntinct scenarios, each represented by <task, domain, language>\ntriples. This approach ensures that evaluations cover a broad\nspectrum of user-oriented tasks, from simple instructions to\nintricate reasoning problems. Additionally, OpenCompass [30]\nextends its scope beyond traditional areas like language and\nreasoning to encompass comprehension and subject-specific\nevaluations, offering a more holistic view of LLM capabilities.\nThe inclusion of dynamic and adaptable tasks is another\nhallmark of modern evaluation frameworks. FlagEval [65], for\nexample, allows users to dynamically combine capabilities,\ntasks, and metrics into ternary groups, significantly enhancing\nthe flexibility and adaptability of the evaluation process. This\nmodular design enables researchers to tailor evaluations to\nspecific needs or emerging trends in LLM development.\nThus, the Tasks Module serves as a cornerstone for evalu-\nating LLMs, providing a structured yet flexible environment\nthat can accommodate both established and new challenges.\nBy continuously updating and refining the task set, it plays a\npivotal role in advancing the SOTA in LLM technology.\n6) Leaderboards and Arena Module: The Leaderboards\nand Arena Module represents an essential tool for bench-\nmarking and comparing LLMs in a transparent and com-\npetitive manner. Leaderboards offer a standardized platform\nwhere models can be evaluated against predefined datasets and\nmetrics, while Arenas introduce a more interactive approach,\nleveraging human preferences to rank models based on direct\ncomparisons [66]. Together, these modules facilitate a deeper\nunderstanding of LLM performance and promote continuous\nimprovement within the research community.\nLeaderboards, such as those provided by Hugging Face\u2019s\nOpen LLM Leaderboard, serve as centralized repositories\nfor sharing and comparing evaluation results. They typi-\ncally highlight key datasets like ARC [67], HellaSwag [68],\nMMLU [16], and TruthfulQA [69], selected for their ability\nto challenge LLMs in different ways. By making evaluation\nresults public, leaderboards foster transparency and encourage\ncollaborative efforts towards improving LLM technologies.\nArenas, on the other hand, adopt a more interactive eval-\nuation paradigm. Platforms like Chatbot Arena [66] allow\nusers to compare outputs from multiple LLMs for a given\nquery, using human preferences as the primary metric. The Elo\nscoring mechanism is employed to dynamically adjust scores\nbased on user feedback, providing a scalable and adaptive\nranking system. It not only streamlines the evaluation process\nbut also captures nuanced differences in performance that\nmight not be evident by automated metrics alone.\nBy engaging the broader community, the Arena Module\nenhances the relevance and reliability of evaluations, ensuring\nthat models are judged based on their actual utility rather than\njust theoretical benchmarks. Furthermore, the Arena Module\naddresses some of the limitations inherent in static leader-\nboards. While leaderboards provide a snapshot of performance\nat a given time, arenas offer ongoing assessments that evolve\nwith user interactions. This dynamic nature helps maintain the\nintegrity and relevance of evaluations, reducing the risk of data\nleakage and ensuring that benchmarks remain challenging and\ninformative. Therefore, the Leaderboards and Arena Module\ncomplements the Tasks Module by providing both standard-\nized and interactive platforms for evaluating LLMs.\n7) Analysis Module: It is designed to interpret and syn-\nthesize the extensive data generated during evaluations. This\nmodule integrates advanced analytical techniques to provide\nmeaningful insights into model performance, thereby guid-\ning future improvements and informing strategic decisions\nregarding LLM deployment. Specifically, it addresses critical\nareas such as Monitoring, Logs, Experiment Management,\nVisualization, and Statistics, each of which plays an essential\nrole in ensuring comprehensive and actionable evaluations.\nMonitoring is essential to tracking the performance of\nLLMs during evaluation. Continuous monitoring allows evalu-\nators to detect anomalies or deviations from expected behavior\npromptly. The module employs real-time feedback mecha-\n\nSHELL et al.: A SAMPLE ARTICLE USING IEEETRAN.CLS FOR IEEE JOURNALS\n9\nTABLE III: 64 typical Intelligence Quotient (IQ)-General Intelligence evaluation

Monitoring also facilitates early detection of\nissues related to computational resources, enabling timely\nadjustments to optimize efficiency. Moreover, continuous mon-\nitoring supports iterative development cycles.\nLogs serve as a record of interactions between LLMs and\nthe evaluation environment, capturing inputs, outputs, and in-\ntermediate states. They are indispensable for post-hoc analysis\nand debugging. It also plays a role in auditing and compliance,\nensuring that evaluations adhere to ethical standards and\nregulatory requirements. By maintaining thorough logs, the\nAnalysis Module enhances transparency and accountability.\nExperiment Management is vital for systematic evalua-\ntions. It involves defining protocols, managing datasets, and\ncontrolling variables to ensure reproducibility and compara-\nbility of results. Platforms like OpenCompass [30] offer ver-\nsatile experimental settings, including zero-shot, few-shot, and\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) configurations, allowing researchers\nto explore different facets of LLM capabilities. Effective\nexperiment management also includes version control and\ndocumentation practices, ensuring that each experiment can\nbe replicated or extended by other researchers.\nVisualization tools transform complex evaluation data into\n\n10\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021\nintuitive and accessible formats, enhancing the interpretability\nof results. The LLM Comparator [123] provides an interactive\ntable and visualization summary that enable users to inspect\nindividual prompts and their responses in detail. These visual\naids facilitate the identification of trends, outliers, and corre-\nlations, supporting deeper analyses. Visualization also plays\na key role in communicating findings to stakeholders who\nmay not have technical expertise, ensuring that insights from\nevaluations are widely understood and acted upon.\nStatistical analysis. Techniques such as hypothesis test-\ning, regression analysis, and confidence interval estimation\nare employed to quantify uncertainties and validate findings.\nStatistical rigor also helps in identifying significant factors\ninfluencing model performance, informing strategies for op-\ntimization and enhancement. By applying robust statistical\npractices, the Analysis Module ensures that evaluations yield\naccurate and trustworthy insights.\nIII. ANTHROPOMORPHIC EVALUATION: IQ, PQ, EQ\nIt necessitates to draw an analogy with human intelli-\ngence, categorizing their abilities into three interconnected\ndimensions: General Intelligence (IQ, Intelligence Quotient),\nAlignment Ability (EQ, Emotional Quotient), and Professional\nExpertise (PQ, Professional Quotient). It allows us to gain a\nmore nuanced and easier understanding of their performance\nin practical scenarios. It also provides guidance to the enhance-\nment of their cognitive, social, and professional competencies.\nA. General Intelligence Evaluation (IQ)\nGeneral Intelligence of an LLM refers to its foundational\ncognitive capabilities (IQ). It encompasses the model\u2019s ability\nto understand, reason, and learn from a wide array of textual\ndata. This includes the capacity for language comprehension,\nlogical reasoning, and the generation of coherent and contextu-\nally appropriate responses. The IQ of an LLM is analogous to\nthe human mind\u2019s ability to process information from various\ndomains and to apply general knowledge flexibly. Crucially,\nIQ corresponds to capabilities developed during pre-training,\nwhere models acquire foundational knowledge through self-\nsupervised learning on massive corpora, reflecting the breadth\nof world knowledge and reasoning ability that forms the\nbedrock of LLM performance.\nDifferent benchmarks offer diverse perspectives through\ntheir unique approaches and task types (Table III). The MMLU\nbenchmark [35] encompasses a diverse array of 57 tasks span-\nning multiple domains such as elementary mathematics, Amer-\nican history, computer science, and law. MMLU-Pro [16], an\nimproved version of MMLU, enhances question quality and\naccuracy by reducing noise and providing a more detailed\nassessment of models\u2019 reasoning abilities. MMLU-Pro+ [124]\nextends its predecessor by evaluating shortcut learning and\nadvanced reasoning capabilities in LLMs. MMLU-Pro+ retains\nthe challenging nature of MMLU-Pro and enhances the as-\nsessment of model discernment, especially in situations where\nmultiple correct answers are possible. MMLU-Redux [125]\nimproves the quality and precision of questions through careful\ncuration, leading to a more accurate evaluation.\nIn contrast, BBH (Big-Bench Hard) is a subset of BIG-\nBench, focusing on the most challenging tasks that require\nmulti-step reasoning, spanning a broad spectrum of fields such\nas mathematics, logic, and commonsense reasoning, aiming to\nevaluate models\u2019 performance in complex tasks [64]. ARC-C\n(AI2 Reasoning Challenge - Challenge Set) is dedicated to\ntesting models\u2019 ability to answer complex scientific questions\nthat require logical reasoning, covering science questions from\nelementary to high school levels, with the goal of assessing\nmodels\u2019 scientific reasoning capabilities [126]. TruthfulQA\nis designed to evaluate the truthfulness of models when\nanswering questions prone to generating false beliefs and\nbiases, using a series of carefully crafted questions to test\nthe reliability and accuracy [69]. Winogrande is a large-scale\ncoreference resolution task that tests models\u2019 ability to handle\ncontextual understanding in sentences through a series of com-\nplex questions [110]. HellaSwag evaluates natural language\ninference by requiring models to complete paragraphs in a\nway that necessitates understanding complex details, aimed\nat assessing models\u2019 commonsense reasoning abilities [68].\nBesides, RV-Bench [127] evaluates LLMs\u2019 mathematical rea-\nsoning by using random variable questions, which require\nmodels to understand the underlying problem structure rather\nthan relying on memorized solutions.\nWhile IQ benchmarks have proliferated, significant chal-\nlenges\npersist.\nFirst,\nthe\n\"memorization\nvs.\nreasoning\"\ndilemma\ncomplicates\nassessment\u2014models\noften\nsucceed\nthrough pattern matching rather than genuine understanding.\nSecond, the rapid capability growth of LLMs has rendered\nmany benchmarks obsolete, creating a \"red queen\" effect\nwhere benchmarks quickly become saturated. Third, most IQ\nassessments remain narrow in scope, failing to capture the\nfull spectrum of human-like reasoning capabilities. Recent\nstudies reveal that even state-of-the-art models struggle with\ncounterfactual reasoning and maintaining consistency across\nextended dialogues, highlighting gaps in current evaluation\nmethodologies.\nB. Professional Expertise Evaluation (PQ)\nPQ represents the specialized knowledge and skills that\nan LLM possesses within a particular area. It is akin to\nthe professional acumen that a human expert might have in\na specific field. PQ in LLMs is evident in their ability to\nprovide detailed, accurate, and nuanced information within\na specialized domain, such as healthcare, financial. Notably,\nPQ corresponds to capabilities acquired during supervised\nfine-tuning, where models develop domain-specific expertise\nthrough targeted instruction-response learning, forming the\noperational foundation for specialized LLM applications.\nTable IV shows recent domain-specific evaluation bench-\nmarks, along with additional comparative dimensions such as\nthe scope of tasks, data sources, and unique contributions. This\ntable excludes the introductory descriptions for brevity and\nfocuses on key attributes that facilitate a comparative analysis.\n1) Healthcare: The healthcare domain has seen the devel-\nopment of specialized benchmarks to evaluate LLMs (LLMs)\nin medical applications, each with unique features contribut-\ning to comprehensive evaluation.

Practical guidance may emphasize\nselecting benchmarks that not only cover a broad range of\nscenarios but also integrate into existing financial operations.\n3) Legal: Benchmarks like LAiW [136], LawBench [30],\nand LegalBench [137] offer detailed assessments in legal con-\ntexts. LAiW divides legal NLP into three categories, including\ncomplex legal application tasks. LawBench simulates judicial\ncognition through twenty tasks and introduces an \"abstention\nrate\" metric [166]. LegalBench [166] encompasses 162 tasks\ncovering 6 types of legal reasoning. These benchmarks col-\nlectively aim to bridge the gap between legal professionals\nand LLM developers, promoting transparency and rigor in\nevaluations. The introduction of metrics like the \u201cabstention\nrate\" in LawBench [30] adds a layer of nuance to evaluating\nLLMs\u2019 ability to handle ambiguous or complex instructions.\n4) Telecommunications: The benchmarks such as TeleQnA\n[37], TelBench [141], and TelecomGPT [142] address unique\nchallenges in evaluating LLMs. TeleQnA [37] evaluates LLMs\nusing 10,000 telecom-related Q&A pairs. TelBench [141]\nextends existing benchmarks with new tasks like Telecom\nMath Modeling and Code Tasks. TelecomGPT [142] proposes\nadaptation pipelines for general-purpose LLMs to telecom-\nspecific models. Besides, interdisciplinary OpsEval [140] eval-\nuates LLMs in wired network operations, 5G, and database\noperations, supporting evaluations in English and Chinese.\n5) Coding: The evaluation within the coding domain is\na critical area that has obtained significant attention due to\nits potential impact on software development practices and\nautomated programming tools [36]. The benchmarks designed\nfor this purpose aim not only to assess the syntactic correctness\nof generated code, but also to evaluate more complex aspects\nsuch as semantic accuracy, functionality, and efficiency. We\nhighlight several key points regarding the current state and\nfuture directions of LLM evaluation for coding.\nExisting benchmarks cover a spectrum of tasks, from syn-\ntactic correctness to semantic accuracy, functionality, and\nefficiency. FullStackBench [147] offers comprehensive real-\nworld scenarios across multiple programming languages, while\nCodeBenchGen [149] focuses on execution-based code gener-\n\n12\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2021\nation tasks and scales with the complexity of programming\nchallenges. EvoCodeBench [167] evolves over time to reflect\ncontemporary coding practices, and HumanEval [36] provides\na strict evaluation protocol for code correctness. APPS [150]\nassesses algorithmic problem-solving skills, and MBPP [151]\nevaluates basic programming tasks. CoderEval [153] empha-\nsizes generating functional code patches, MultiPL-E [154]\noffers a scalable framework for neural code generation, and\nCodeXGLUE [155] covers a range of code intelligence tasks.\nSpecifically, FullStackBench [147] and CodeBenchGen\n[149] offer coverages of coding environments, but their static\nnature may limit their ability to adapt to evolving coding\nstandards. EvoCodeBench [167] addresses this by evolving\nover time, ensuring that benchmarks remain relevant to con-\ntemporary practices. HumanEval [36] and APPS [150] focus\non code correctness and efficiency, making them essential for\nverifying practical utility. MBPP [151] evaluates basic pro-\ngramming skills, while CoderEval [153], MultiPL-E [154], and\nCodeXGLUE [155] address specific aspects like functional\ncode patches, neural code generation, and code intelligence.\n6) Software: In software engineering, benchmarks like\nSWE-bench [168], Owl-Bench [169] and CodeMMLU [170]\nprovide structured assessing approaches in software develop-\nment. SWE-bench [168] evaluates LLMs\u2019 ability to resolve\nreal-world GitHub issues, while Owl-Bench assesses their pro-\nficiency in software documentation [169]. CodeMMLU [170]\nincludes 10K questions sourced from diverse domains, encom-\npassing tasks like code analysis, defect detection, and software\nengineering principles across programming languages.\nThese benchmarks collectively cover a broad spectrum of\nsoftware engineering tasks, from operations management to\nissue resolution and documentation. The comparison high-\nlights the importance of task-oriented evaluations and practical\napplication scenarios, ensuring that LLMs can effectively\nassist in real-world software development processes.\n7) Science: It is a critical area where LLMs have the poten-\ntial to significantly impact research and discovery processes\n[157]. Evaluating LLMs in this domain requires specialized\nbenchmarks that assess their ability to understand, generate,\nand apply scientific knowledge across diverse fields such\nas biology, chemistry, physics, and medicine. This section\nprovides an overview of prominent evaluation benchmarks\ndesigned to assess LLMs\u2019 capabilities in scientific tasks.\nKey benchmarks\u2014LiveIdeaBench [157], ScienceAgent-\nBench\n[158],\nSymbolicregression\n[159],\nDiscoveryWorld\n[160], ProtocoLLM [161], and SciSafeEval [162]\u2014are pivotal\nfor LLMs in scientific domains. LiveIdeaBench [157] assesses\nmodels\u2019 scientific creativity and divergent thinking across four\ndimensions (originality, feasibility, fluency, flexibility) using\nsingle-keyword prompts.

They highlight not only the importance of scientific\ncreativity and literature analysis but also emphasize practical\naspects such as hands-on experimentation, hypothesis testing,\nand ethical considerations. For instance, LiveIdeaBench [157]\nand SciAssess [163] offer unique methodologies for assessing\ndivergent thinking and innovative idea generation, indicating\nthat LLMs require distinct evaluation approaches beyond tra-\nditional memory and understanding. On the other hand, Dis-\ncoveryWorld [160] and ProtocoLLM [161] focus on practical\nskills, underscoring the significance of experimental design\nand hypothesis formation, which are essential for cultivating\nLLMs\u2019 actual research capabilities. Furthermore, SciVerse\n[164] and SciSafeEval [162] extend the evaluation scope to\ninclude multi-modal reasoning and safety alignment, ensuring\nthat LLMs can effectively handle complex datasets while\nadhering to ethical standards. Collectively, these benchmarks\nguide the development of more advanced LLMs, ultimately\ncontributing to accelerating scientific innovation and discovery.\nC. Alignment Ability Evaluation (EQ)\nThe concept of Alignment Ability, often referred to as\nEmotional Quotient (EQ) in the context of LLMs, is a critical\naspect of evaluating how well these models can understand\nand appropriately respond to the emotional and social nuances\nwithin human interactions. This evaluation is essential for\nensuring that LLMs not only generate text that is coherent and\nrelevant but also that they do so in a manner that is empathetic,\nculturally sensitive, and ethically sound [204]. Specifically,\nEQ corresponds to capabilities refined through reinforcement\nlearning from human feedback, where models learn to align\noutputs with human values, ensuring socially appropriate and\n\nSHELL et al.: A SAMPLE ARTICLE USING IEEETRAN.CLS FOR IEEE JOURNALS\n13\nethically sound interactions.\nAs shown in Table V, benchmarks have been developed to\nassess the EQ of LLMs, each focusing on different aspects\nof emotional intelligence. For instance, EQ-Bench [181] is a\nnotable benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the emo-\ntional intelligence of LLMs. It challenges the models to predict\nthe intensity of emotional states of characters in a dialogue,\nthereby assessing their ability to understand complex emotions\nand social interactions. The EQ-Bench dataset consists of 171\ncarefully crafted questions, providing a robust framework for\nmeasuring the emotional acumen of LLMs. Meanwhile, Align-\nBench includes a comprehensive multi-dimensional approach\nto evaluating the alignment of LLMs with human intent [25], it\nencompasses a wide range of categories, including reliability,\nand it uses a combination of 683 real-scenario rooted queries\nand corresponding human-verified references to ensure that\nthe evaluation reflects actual usage contexts. This benchmark\nallows for a nuanced assessment of model performance across\nvarious dimensions, such as creativity, logic, and sensitivity.\nRewardBench [29] and TrustLLM [180] are also notewor-\nthy, as they focus on different facets of alignment. Reward-\nBench evaluates the reward modeling capabilities of LLMs,\nwhich is crucial for understanding and following instructions,\nwhile TrustLLM measures the trustworthiness of models, an\nessential component of user confidence and safety. These\nbenchmarks, along with others like IFEval [24] and LLMBar\n[178], which concentrate on instruction following, provide a\ncomprehensive suite of tools for researchers and developers to\nmeasure and improve the alignment of LLMs with human ex-\npectations. Besides, the Fairness benchmark [173] and CASE-\nBench [172] both highlight the importance of aligning LLMs\nwith human values. The Fairness benchmark evaluates LLMs\u2019\nalignment with distributive fairness concepts like equitability\nand envy-freeness, revealing a lack of alignment with human\npreferences. CASE-Bench focuses on safety, integrating con-\ntext into safety assessments and showing context\u2019s significant\ninfluence on human judgments. Both underscore the need for\nLLMs to better align with societal norms [205].\nIV. VALUE-ORIENTED EVALUATION OF LLMS\nExtant works predominantly employ conventional perfor-\nmance metrics to assess LLMs. However, these metrics are\nfrequently insufficient to encapsulate the complex societal,\neconomic, ethical, and environmental repercussions of deploy-\ning LLMs. Recent studies have begun to explore alternative\nevaluation frameworks that consider a broader spectrum of\nimpacts, signaling a shift towards more holistic assessments.\nAs shown in Fig. 4, this section delves into a value-oriented\nevaluation framework for LLMs, which transcends conven-\ntional performance benchmarks to encompass a holistic assess-\nment including economic, social, ethical, and environmental\nconsiderations. By advocating for an evaluation approach that\nnot only quantifies technical proficiency but also qualifies the\nbroader implications of LLM deployment, this paper aims to\ncontribute to the discourse on responsible AI development.\na) Economic Value: We give some key metrics: Cost-\nBenefit Ratio (CBR): This metric evaluates the ratio of the\nFig. 4: Value-oriented Evaluation for LLMs.\nbenefits derived from the model to the costs incurred in\nits development and deployment. A higher CBR indicates a\nmore economically viable solution. Return on Investment\n(ROI): it measures the financial return generated by the model\nrelative to the initial investment. It provides a clear indication\nof the model\u2019s profitability and long-term financial viability.\nProductivity Improvement (PI): PI assesses the extent to\nwhich the model enhances productivity in specific application\ndomains. For instance, in a business setting, an LLM that\nautomates customer service can significantly reduce response\ntimes and improve efficiency. Market Acceptance (MA):\nMarket acceptance is a qualitative metric that gauges the\nlevel of adoption and user satisfaction with the model. High\nmarket acceptance suggests that the model meets the needs\nand expectations of its target audience.\nb) Social Value: The following metrics are used to eval-\nuate social value: User Satisfaction (US): User satisfaction is\na direct measure of how well the model meets the needs and\npreferences of its users. Surveys and feedback mechanisms\ncan be employed to gather this data. Knowledge Dissemi-\nnation Efficiency (KDE): it measures the effectiveness of the\nmodel in spreading knowledge and information. In educational\nsettings, for example, an LLM that can generate high-quality\nlearning materials can significantly enhance the dissemination\nof knowledge. Public Service Improvement (PSI): it evalu-\nates the extent to which the model improves the quality and\nefficiency of public services. Case studies and expert reviews\ncan provide insights into the model\u2019s impact on public service\ndelivery. Education Quality Improvement (EQI): it assesses\nthe contribution of the model to enhancing the quality of\neducation. Metrics such as student performance and teacher\nfeedback can be used to quantify this improvement.\nc) Ethical Value: Ethical considerations are paramount\nin the deployment of LLMs, as these models can have signif-\nicant implications for fairness, transparency, and privacy. The\nfollowing metrics are used to evaluate ethical value: Fairness\n(F): Fairness ensures that the model performs equitably across\ndifferent demographic groups. Statistical tests and bias detec-\ntion methods can be used to identify and mitigate any dispar-\nities. Transparency (T): Transparency refers to the model\u2019s\nability to provide understandable and clear explanations for\nits decisions.

Regular audits and bias mitigation strategies are\nnecessary to maintain the model\u2019s ethical integrity.\nd) Environmental Value: It considers the ecological\nimpact of LLMs, including energy consumption and carbon\nfootprint. The following metrics are used: Energy Efficiency\n(EE): EE measures the energy consumption of the model\nduring operation. Carbon Footprint (CF): CF quantifies the\ntotal carbon emissions associated with the model\u2019s lifecycle,\nfrom development to deployment. Reducing the carbon foot-\nprint is crucial for mitigating the environmental impact of\nAI technologies. Sustainability (S): Sustainability evaluates\nthe long-term environmental and social impact of the model.\nLife cycle assessments and future projections can provide a\ncomprehensive view of the model\u2019s sustainability.\nV. LLM SYSTEM OR APPLICATION EVALUATION\nIn this section, we delve into the intricacies of evaluating\nLLM systems and applications, exploring the methodologies,\nmetrics, and benchmarks that are pivotal in ensuring the\nadvancement and responsible deployment of these powerful\nAI tools. It also focuses on three pivotal areas: Retrieval-\nAugmented Generation (RAG), AI Agents, and Chatbots.\nA. RAG Evaluation\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as\na pivotal approach to enhancing the capabilities of LLMs\nby integrating retrieval mechanisms with generative processes\n[28]. The evaluation of RAG models focuses on the model\u2019s\nability to incorporate retrieved information seamlessly into its\nresponses[206]. This assessment goes beyond merely judging\nthe quality of the generated text, it also scrutinizes the preci-\nsion and relevance of the retrieved data, alongside how well\nthis information complements and enriches the final output.\nKey performance indicators for RAG systems typically en-\ncompass the retrieval process\u2019s accuracy and completeness, as\nwell as the logical consistency and contextual appropriateness\nof the augmented content. Table VI provides a comprehen-\nsive overview of various benchmarks designed to assess the\nperformance of RAG systems across diverse domains.\nThe diversity of evaluation aspects and metrics employed by\nthese frameworks highlights the multifaceted nature of RAG\nassessment. For instance, RAGAS from Exploding Gradients\nfocuses on automated evaluation through customized metrics\nthat measure answer relevance, context relevance, and faithful-\nness [206]. It is particularly valuable for its ability to evaluate\nthe alignment between retrieved contexts and generated an-\nswers, ensuring that the output remains grounded in factual\ninformation. Similarly, BERGEN emphasizes consistency in\nbenchmarking RAG pipelines, addressing the challenge of\ninconsistent evaluations that can hinder comparative analysis\n[217]. By leveraging HuggingFace for reproducibility and\nintegration, BERGEN facilitates a standardized approach to\nevaluating RAG systems, thereby promoting transparency and\ncomparability in research findings. Table VII encapsulates a\nrange of evaluation metrics essential for assessing the perfor-\nmance of LLMs (LLMs). Each metric serves a distinct pur-\npose, contributing to a comprehensive evaluation framework\nthat ensures models are not only technically proficient but\nalso contextually relevant and factually accurate. These metrics\ntogether form a robust evaluation framework that supports the\ndevelopment and deployment of LLMs by offering detailed\ninsights into their performance across dimensions.\nOn the other hand, CRAG introduces a benchmark to\nsimulate web and Knowledge Graph (KG) search, covering\na wide array of question types and domains [208]. Such\nextensive coverage allows researchers to explore the robustness\nand versatility of RAG systems under varying conditions. In\ncontrast, raga-llm-hub offers a comprehensive toolkit with over\n100 evaluation metrics, focusing on multiple dimensions such\nas relevance, quality, safety, and more [218].

The use of\nannotated data enhances the reliability of evaluations, offering\ninsights into both the strengths and weaknesses of RAG\nsystems. Moreover, RGB [211] focuses on four fundamental\ncapabilities: negative rejection, noise robustness, counterfac-\ntual robustness, and information integration. BEIR focus on\nout-of-distribution and zero-shot tasks underscores the im-\nportance of adaptability in RAG systems, preparing them\nfor scenarios where prior knowledge may be limited [212].\nMeanwhile, ALCE [213] emphasizes on citation quality and\ncorrectness addresses concerns about hallucinations, ensuring\nthat generated content adheres to established facts and sources.\nB. Agent Evaluation\nThe advent of LLMs has led to advancements in AI Agents\ncapable of autonomously interacting with various environ-\nments and tools. To ensure that these agents meet the desired\nstandards, a variety of evaluation frameworks have emerged\n[219, 220, 221, 222]. Each framework targets different aspects\nof Agent performance, such as tool usage, decision-making,\nrole-playing, and multi-modal interaction. Table VIII compares\nseveral key benchmarks across multiple dimensions, highlight-\ning their unique contributions to the field.\nAgentBench [220] and API-Bank [221] emphasize evaluat-\ning Agents across diverse real-world scenarios, including cod-\ning, gaming, web interactions, and tool invocations. This broad\nscope ensures that Agents are tested under conditions closely\nresembling their intended operational environments, providing\nvaluable feedback on their generalization capabilities.\nMetrics play a crucial role in assessing Agent performance.\nFor example, AgentBoard [222] introduces novel metrics\nsuch as process rate and grounding accuracy, offering deeper\ninsights into how effectively Agents handle complex tasks.\nMeanwhile, MMRole [226] evaluates multimodal interaction\nthrough detailed criteria considering both textual and visual\nelements, ensuring a more holistic assessment.\nMoreover, new entries like BFCL [228] focus on function-\ncalling tasks, including multi-task and parallel function calls,\nchallenging the Agents\u2019 ability to handle complex logic.\nToolLLM [65] enables LLMs to master over 16,000 real-\nworld APIs, while ToolBench [231] assesses the capability of\nAgents to manipulate software tools used in real-world tasks.\nWebarena [230] creates realistic web environments for Agents\nto complete various web-based tasks. The GLEE [227] frame-\nwork focuses on agents\u2019 behavior within economic contexts,\nusing parameters such as parameterization, degrees of free-\ndom, and economic measures to evaluate agent performance.\nThis highlights the importance of understanding societal and\neconomic activities. The lack of standardized evaluation meth-\nods remains a challenge. Frameworks like PersonaGym [225]\nintroduce scoring systems, such as PersonaScore, which could\npave the way for establishing industry-wide standards.\nC. ChatBot Evaluation\nThe assessment of modern chatbot systems, particularly\nthose based on LLMs, requires multidimensional frameworks\naddressing linguistic coherence, contextual understanding, and\nethical considerations (Table IX). As conversational AI evolves\nfrom single-turn responses to multi-party dialogues, traditional\nevaluation metrics such as BLEU [39] and ROUGE [41]\nprove insufficient for capturing the complexity of human-like\ninteractions. This section analyzes state-of-the-art benchmarks\nacross 3 critical dimensions: dialogue quality, fairness and\nhuman interaction patterns.\nDialogue Quality Assessment: it focuses on structural, lin-\nguistic, and contextual dimensions. BotChatBenchmark [232]\nintroduces the ChatSEED methodology, where real-world di-\nalogue snippets serve as prompts for LLMs to generate full-\nlength conversations. Using GPT-4 as a meta-judge, this frame-\nwork reveals significant performance disparities: while GPT-4\nachieves top consistency with human dialogues, open-source\nmodels like Llama2-70B exhibit suboptimal verbosity errors.\nMT-Bench-101 [233] extends this analysis through a three-tier\ntaxonomy covering 13 tasks, exposing critical failure modes\nin error recovery and instruction-following. Besides, the MT-\nBench framework [33] establishes human judgment standards,\ndemonstrating that crowd-sourced evaluations correlate with\nexpert assessments. For question-answering systems, CoQA\n[239] and QuAC [240] employ F1/ROUGE metrics, revealing\nthat models struggle with pronoun resolution.\nFairness Evaluation: FairMT-Bench [234] constructs a\n10K-dialogue dataset spanning gender, ethnicity, and occu-\npational biases, showing that LLMs exhibit up to 37% per-\nformance variance across sensitive scenarios.

Chatbot Arena [66] collects\n33K competitive dialogues through a crowdsourced platform,\ndemonstrating that closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4) outper-\nform open-source alternatives in user preference scores. MT-\nEval [235] identifies four interaction patterns\u2014recollection,\nexpansion, refinement, and follow-up\u2014showing that error\npropagation increases in multi-turn settings. WildChat [238]\nprovides unprecedented scale with 1M ChatGPT interactions,\nrevealing different user behaviors.\nVI. CHALLENGES AND OUTLOOK\nWe propose a six-tiered challenges and future opportunities:\nstarting from foundational methodological concerns (statistical\nrigor and reproducibility), advancing through technical eval-\nuation complexities (composite metrics and interpretability),\nextending to application-level considerations (user experience\nand human-in-the-loop assessment), encompassing system-\nlevel evaluation (pragmatic system analysis and failure ex-\nploration), adapting to evolutionary dynamics (dynamic eval-\nuation mechanisms), and ultimately reaching value-oriented\ndimensions (economic, social, ethical, and environmental im-\npacts). This structure reflects how LLM evaluation must evolve\nfrom purely technical assessments toward holistic frameworks.\na) Enhanced Statistical Analysis for LLM Evaluation:\nCurrent evaluation practices suffer from a critical methodolog-\nical gap: the lack of rigorous statistical foundations necessary\nfor reliable performance assessment. Most benchmarks report\npoint estimates without confidence intervals, making it difficult\nto determine whether observed performance differences rep-\nresent genuine capability improvements or merely statistical\nnoise. Integrating rigorous statistical methods is essential to\ntransform LLM evaluation from simplistic scoring to scientif-\nically valid methodology for reliable model development.\nb) Composite Evaluation/Ranking Systems: Developing\ncomposite and comprehensive evaluation/ranking systems rep-\nresents the necessary evolution beyond basic statistical rigor.\nCurrent evaluation methods often focus on specific tasks or\nbenchmarks, which may not fully capture the multifaceted\ncapabilities of LLMs. A composite system that integrates\nvarious metrics and evaluation criteria can provide a more\nnuanced and comprehensive assessment.\nc) Interpretability and Explainability: One fundamental\nchallenge in evaluating LLMs is the alignment between the\nfine-grained decision-making logic of the models and human\ncognition. Current evaluation practices often focus on the\ncorrectness of the output, merely addressing hallucination\nand value alignment issues. However, in practical industrial\napplications, the crux of assessing the credibility of LLMs\nlies in the correctness of the underlying decision logic that\nleads to the output. This is particularly challenging because,\neven though LLMs may exhibit high accuracy on specific\ntasks, their internal decision logic can be highly chaotic and\nmisaligned with human reasoning. Developing explainable AI\n(XAI) techniques specifically tailored for LLMs can enhance\ntransparency and facilitate better human-AI collaboration.\nd) User-Centric Experience as a Benchmark: Moving\nbeyond purely technical assessments, user-centric experience\nrepresents a crucial application-level consideration. Traditional\nbenchmarks often focus on technical performance metrics,\nwhich may not fully capture the user\u2019s perspective. Incorpo-\nrating user feedback and usability testing can provide more\nvaluable insights into the practical utility and user satisfaction\nof LLMs. This can be achieved via user studies, surveys, and\ninteractive sessions with qualitative data on user experiences.\ne) Human in the Loop Evaluation (HITL): Human in\nthe Loop Evaluation extends user-centric assessment into a\nmore sophisticated system-level framework. This approach is\ncrucial for addressing the limitations of automated evaluation\nmethods. HITL involves human evaluators who can provide\nsubjective judgments and context-specific insights that auto-\nmated systems may miss. HITL enhances the relevance and re-\nliability of evaluations, ensuring that models are judged based\non their actual utility rather than just theoretical benchmarks.\nFurthermore, the Arena Module concept addresses limitations\ninherent in static leaderboards by offering ongoing assessments\nthat evolve with user interaction, providing a dynamic and\nrealistic evaluation environment in actual usage contexts.\nf) Analytical Failure Exploration: Understanding the\nroot causes of failures represents a deeper layer of sys-\ntem evaluation that moves beyond surface-level performance\nmetrics. Analytical failure exploration involves identifying\nand analyzing the specific reasons why an LLM fails in\ncertain tasks. This can be achieved through techniques such\nas error analysis, case studies, and post-hoc explanations. By\npinpointing the underlying issues, researchers can develop\ntargeted interventions to address these weaknesses. Addition-\nally, sharing failure cases and their analyses can foster a\n\nSHELL et al.: A SAMPLE ARTICLE USING IEEETRAN.CLS FOR IEEE JOURNALS\n17\ncollaborative environment where the community can learn\nfrom each other\u2019s experiences and collectively improve LLMs.\nThis approach moves evaluation from merely identifying what\nfails to understanding why it fails, enabling more meaningful\nimprovements in model design and deployment strategies.\ng) Dynamic Evaluation: It represents a critical shift\nfrom one-time assessment to continuous evaluation. Dynamic\nevaluation ensures that LLMs are assessed under realistic and\nup-to-date conditions, promoting continuous improvement and\ninnovation.\nh) Superior Value-Oriented Evaluation: The highest\ntier of evaluation considerations would encompasses value-\noriented dimensions that transcend technical performance to\nconsider broader societal implications. Implementing a value-\noriented evaluation framework requires a multi-faceted im-\nplementation, combining quantitative and qualitative analysis,\ndata collection, expert reviews, and user feedback. This rep-\nresents the natural culmination of evaluation considerations,\nfrom technical assessment to societal impact.\nVII. CONCLUSIONS\nThis survey repositions LLM evaluation beyond benchmark-\ncentric approaches by introducing an anthropomorphic frame-\nwork that bridges the critical gap between technical perfor-\nmance and real-world impact. We pioneer a holistic IQ-EQ-\nPQ-VQ taxonomy\u2014integrating General Intelligence, Align-\nment Ability, Professional Expertise, and Value Quotient, that\ntranscends fragmented metrics to capture what LLMs know,\nhow they apply knowledge, why their outputs resonate with\nhuman values, and how they contribute to societal well-\nbeing. Critically, this taxonomy reflects the developmental\ntrajectory of LLMs themselves, with IQ corresponding to pre-\ntraining knowledge acquisition, PQ emerging from supervised\nfine-tuning, and EQ cultivated through reinforcement learn-\ning\u2014providing not just an evaluation framework but a diag-\nnostic lens for model development. The systematic analysis of\nover 200 benchmarks across six dimensions that reveals hidden\ninterconnections and critical gaps, we present a modular eval-\nuation architecture with six interconnected components that\nprovides practitioners with actionable guidance for end-to-end\nevaluation pipelines.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.

It aims to offer a comprehensive\noverview of the methodologies used to assess these models and to\nshowcase examples of leading models in the field.\nA. Evaluation Methodology\n1) Metric-centered Evaluation: It focuses on quantifying the\nperformance of LLMs (LLMs) using standardized metrics. Common\nmetrics include BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore, each\ncapturing different aspects of text quality and relevance. For example,\nBLEU measures the precision of n-grams in generated text compared\nto reference texts, while ROUGE focuses on recall, assessing how\nwell the generated text captures key ideas from the reference.\nBERTScore, on the other hand, leverages contextual embeddings to\nevaluate semantic similarity, providing a more nuanced assessment\nof text quality. These metrics are essential for benchmarking and\ncomparing LLMs across various tasks and datasets.\n2) Human-centered Evaluation: Human-centered evaluation\ninvolves human judges assessing the quality, relevance, and natu-\nralness of LLM-generated text. This approach complements metric-\ncentered evaluation by capturing subjective aspects that automated\nmetrics may miss. For example, humans can evaluate whether\ngenerated text is coherent, contextually relevant, and free from\nbiases. Human evaluation can also involve tasks such as rating the\nfaithfulness of generated text to the input context or assessing the\noverall quality of generated summaries. This method is particularly\nimportant for evaluating the practical utility of LLMs in real-world\napplications.\n3) Model-Centric Evaluation: It focuses on the internal mech-\nanisms and capabilities of LLMs. This includes analyzing the model\u2019s\narchitecture, training process, and the quality of its embeddings. For\nexample, evaluating the alignment between the model\u2019s decision logic\nand human reasoning is crucial for ensuring that LLMs produce\noutputs that are not only correct but also interpretable. Techniques e.g.\nfeature importance analysis and attention mechanisms can provide\ninsights into the model\u2019s decision-making process, helping to identify\npotential biases or areas for improvement.\nB. Prominent LLMs\nSeveral prominent LLMs have emerged in recent years, each\nwith unique capabilities and applications. For example, GPT-4 from\nOpenAI has demonstrated advanced capabilities in natural language\nunderstanding and generation. Other notable models include Meta\u2019s\nLlama series and Alibaba\u2019s Qwen series, which have been fine-\ntuned for various NLP tasks. These models are evaluated using a\ncombination of intrinsic metrics (such as, perplexity, accuracy) and\nextrinsic metrics (such as, performance on specific tasks) to assess\ntheir overall effectiveness. The choice of LLM often depends on the\nspecific application, with each model offering trade-offs in terms\nof performance, computational efficiency, and ease of use. Table\nX demonstrates list of prominent LLMs (published after 2022 and\nmodel parameters over 1B) and their basic information.\nTABLE X: List of Prominent LLMs and their basic informa-\ntion ( accurate as of August 20, 2025), includes representative\nmodels and does not encompass all available models.\nModel\nDate\nOrganization\nCountry\nPara (B)\nArena Elo\nQwen3-235B-A22B\n2025-07-22\nAlibaba\nChina\n235\n1422\nGrok-4\n2025-07-09\nxAI\nUSA\n-\n1425\nGemini 2.5 Pro\n2025-06-05\nGoogle\nUSA\n-\n1457\nDeepSeek-R1\n2025-05-28\nDeepSeek\nChina\n671\n1417\nClaude Sonnet 4\n2025-05-22\nAnthropic\nUSA\n-\n-\no3\n2025-04-16\nOpenAI\nUSA\n-\n1445\nLlama 4 Maverick\n2025-04-08\nMeta AI\nUSA\n-\n-\nLlama 3.1 Nemotron\n2025-04-07\nNVIDIA\nUSA\n253\n1345\nGPT-4.5\n2025-02-27\nOpenAI\nUSA\n-\n1439\nDeepSeek-V3\n2024-12-24\nDeepSeek\nChina\n671\n1317\nLlama 3.3\n2024-12-06\nMeta AI\nUSA\n70\n1274\nHunyuan-Large\n2024-11-06\nTencent\nChina\n389\n1250\nDoubao-pro\n2024-10-28\nByteDance\nChina\n-\n-\nPalmyra X 004\n2024-10-09\nWriter\nUSA\n-\n-\nQwen2.5-72B\n2024-09-19\nAlibaba\nChina\n73\n1283\nJamba 1.5-Large\n2024-08-22\nAI21 Labs\nIsrael\n398\n1305\nAFM-on-device\n2024-07-29\nApple\nUSA\n-\n-\nMistral Large 2\n2024-07-24\nMistral AI\nFrance\n123\n1276\nLlama 3.1-405B\n2024-07-23\nMeta AI\nUSA\n405\n1269\nDeepSeek-Coder-V2\n2024-06-17\nDeepSeek\nChina\n236\n1214\nNemotron-4 340B\n2024-06-14\nNVIDIA\nUSA\n340\n1209\nQwen2-72B\n2024-06-07\nAlibaba\nChina\n73\n1187\nLlama 3-70B\n2024-04-18\nMeta AI\nUSA\n70\n1248\nReALM\n2024-03-29\nApple\nUSA\n-\n-\nDBRX\n2024-03-27\nDatabricks\nUSA\n132\n1103\nAraMCO\n2024-03-04\nSaudi Aramco\nSA\n250\n-\nMegaScale\n2024-02-23\nByteDance\nChina\n530\n-\nAya\n2024-02-12\nCohere\nMulti\n13\n1179\nQwen1.5-72B\n2024-02-04\nAlibaba\nChina\n72\n1118\nPalmyra X 003\n2024-01-01\nWriter\nUSA\n72\n-\nMixtral 8x7B\n2023-12-11\nMistral AI\nFrance\n467\n1148\nLlama Guard\n2023-12-07\nMeta AI\nUSA\n70\n1206\nQwen-72B\n2023-11-30\nAlibaba\nChina\n72\n1187\nPPLX-70B\n2023-11-29\nPerplexity\nUSA\n70\n1081\nNemotron-3-8B\n2023-11-15\nNVIDIA\nUSA\n8\n-\nGrok-1\n2023-11-04\nxAI\nUSA\n314\n1266\nBLUUMI\n2023-11-03\nTurku\nFinland\n176\n-\nYi-34B\n2023-11-02\n01.AI\nChina\n34\n1213\nSkywork-13B\n2023-10-30\nKunlun\nChina\n13\n-\nFinGPT-13B\n2023-10-07\nUCLA\nUSA\n13\n-\nFalcon-180B\n2023-09-06\nTII\nUAE\n180\n1034\nJais\n2023-08-29\nCerebras\nMulti\n13\n-\nLlama 2-70B\n2023-07-18\nMeta AI\nUSA\n70\n1206\nLlama 2-7B\n2023-07-18\nMeta AI\nUSA\n-\n1037\nInternLM\n2023-07-06\nSAI Lab\nChina\n100\n-\nGoat-7B\n2023-05-23\nNUS\nSingapore\n70\n-\nCodeT5+\n2023-05-20\nSalesforce\nUSA\n160\n-\nCoEdiT-xxl\n2023-05-17\nMinnesota\nUSA\n110\n-\nPaLM 2\n2023-05-10\nGoogle\nUSA\n340\n-\nStarCoder\n2023-05-09\nHugging Face\nMulti\n155\n-\nIncoder-6.7B\n2023-04-09\nFAIR\nUSA\n67\n-\nBloombergGPT\n2023-03-30\nBloomberg\nUSA\n505.588\n-\nFalcon-40B\n2023-03-15\nTII\nUAE\n40\n-\nLLaMA-65B\n2023-02-24\nMeta AI\nUSA\n652\n-\nHybrid H3-2.7B\n2022-12-28\nStanford\nUSA\n27\n-\nGPT-3.5 Turbo\n2022-11-30\nOpenAI\nUSA\n200\n1117\nmT0-13B\n2022-11-03\nHugging Face\nMulti\n13\n-\nBLOOMZ-176B\n2022-11-03\nHugging Face\nMulti\n176\n-\nU-PaLM\n2022-10-20\nGoogle\nUSA\n540\n-\nLMSI-Palm\n2022-10-20\nGoogle\nUSA\n540\n-\nFlan-T5 11B\n2022-10-20\nGoogle\nUSA\n110\n-\nFlan-PaLM\n2022-10-20\nGoogle\nUSA\n540\n-\nBlenderBot 3\n2022-08-10\nMcGill\nCanada\n175\n-\nGLM-130B\n2022-08-04\nTHU\nChina\n130\n-\nAlexaTM 20B\n2022-08-02\nAmazon\nUSA\n197.5\n-\nBLOOM-176B\n2022-07-11\nHugging Face\nMulti\n176\n-\nNLLB\n2022-07-06\nMeta AI\nUSA\n54.5\n-\nMinerva (540B)\n2022-06-29\nGoogle\nUSA\n540\n-\nUL2\n2022-05-10\nGoogle\nMulti\n200\n-\nOPT-175B\n2022-05-02\nMeta AI\nUSA\n175\n-\nSparse all-MLP\n2022-04-14\nMeta AI\nUSA\n94.1\n-\nPaLM (540B)\n2022-04-04\nGoogle\nMulti\n540\n-\nChinchilla\n2022-03-29\nDeepMind\nUK\n70\n-\nDeepNet\n2022-03-01\nMicrosoft\nUSA\n32\n-\nPolyCoder\n2022-02-26\nCMU\nUSA\n27\n-\nST-MoE\n2022-02-17\nGoogle\nUSA\n269\n-\nLaMDA\n2022-02-10\nGoogle\nUSA\n137\n-\nGPT-NeoX-20B\n2022-02-09\nEleutherAI\nMulti\n200\n-\nRETRO-7B\n2022-02-07\nDeepMind\nUK\n75\n-\nAlphaCode\n2022-02-02\nDeepMind\nUK\n411\n-\nInstructGPT 175B\n2022-01-27\nOpenAI\nUSA\n175\n-\nInstructGPT 6B\n2022-01-27\nOpenAI\nUSA\n60\n-\nInstructGPT 1.3B\n2022-01-27\nOpenAI\nUSA\n1.3\n-\nC. Discussion: Critical Reflections on Evaluation Practices\n1) The Disconnect Between Evaluation Benchmarks and\nReal-World Performance: A critical challenge in contemporary\nLLM evaluation lies in the growing misalignment between stan-\ndardized benchmarks and practical deployment requirements. While\n\nSHELL et al.: A SAMPLE ARTICLE USING IEEETRAN.CLS FOR IEEE JOURNALS\n23\ntraditional evaluation methodologies provide valuable snapshots of\nmodel capabilities in controlled environments, they often fail to\ncapture the nuanced interplay between model architecture, contextual\nadaptation, and real-world utility. This performance discrepancy re-\nveals a fundamental limitation in current evaluation paradigms\u2014their\ninability to adequately assess models in dynamic, interactive settings\nthat better approximate production environments. The emergence\nof frameworks like Mint and WebArena represents a promising\nstep toward addressing this gap by simulating realistic user interac-\ntions and environmental feedback loops, yet their adoption remains\nlimited compared to traditional static benchmarks. This disconnect\nbetween laboratory evaluations and practical deployment outcomes\nhas significant implications, as organizations increasingly rely on\nbenchmark scores to make critical deployment decisions without fully\nunderstanding the limitations of these metrics in predicting real-world\nperformance.\n2) Fragmentation and Proliferation of Evaluation Bench-\nmarks: The rapid proliferation of specialized evaluation benchmarks\nhas created both opportunities and significant challenges for the\nresearch community. Analysis of numerous evaluation frameworks\nreveals substantial variation in model rankings across different bench-\nmark categories, complicating cross-model comparison and creating\nwhat we term \"evaluation overload.\" The situation is further exacer-\nbated by the resource-intensive nature of comprehensive evaluation,\nwhich effectively excludes many academic and independent research\ngroups from meaningful participation in rigorous model assessment.\nThe knowledge base reveals an overwhelming diversity of bench-\nmarks targeting specific capabilities, each with its own methodology\nand scoring system, making it difficult to synthesize a coherent\nunderstanding of model capabilities across the evaluation spectrum.\nThis fragmentation hinders the development of a unified evaluation\nstandard that could facilitate more meaningful progress in the field.\n3) Language-Specific and Cultural Dimensions in LLM\nEvaluation: Evaluating language models in non-English contexts\npresents unique methodological challenges that extend beyond mere\ntranslation of English-centric benchmarks. The intricate nature of\nlinguistic features in languages such as Chinese\u2014including character-\nbased semantics, tonal variations, and cultural context dependen-\ncies\u2014requires specialized assessment frameworks that account for\nthese distinctive characteristics. Current evaluation practices often\noverlook critical aspects such as idiomatic expression comprehension,\nclassical language references, and culturally appropriate response\ngeneration. The knowledge base references several Chinese-specific\nevaluation frameworks like Zhujiu, yet these remain insufficient to\naddress the full spectrum of linguistic and cultural nuances. This\nlimitation extends beyond Chinese to numerous other languages,\nhighlighting the urgent need for culturally adaptive metrics that assess\nnot only linguistic accuracy but also sociocultural appropriateness\nwithin specific language contexts. The current evaluation ecosystem\nremains heavily biased toward English, with only a fraction of bench-\nmarks addressing multilingual capabilities, thereby marginalizing the\nneeds of the global majority of non-English language users.\n4) Toward Integrated and Practical Evaluation Frame-\nworks: Addressing the challenges outlined above requires the de-\nvelopment of meta-evaluation frameworks that can synthesize results\nfrom multiple assessment dimensions while remaining accessible to\nresource-constrained researchers. Weighted aggregation approaches\nthat prioritize benchmarks based on real-world task relevance rather\nthan equal weighting offer a promising path forward, creating more\nmeaningful composite scores that better predict practical model\nutility across diverse application scenarios.

Creative writing requires a balance be-\ntween subjective writing quality (e.g., literariness and emo-\ntional expression) and objective constraint following (e.g.,\nformat requirements and word limits). Existing reinforcement\nlearning methods struggle to balance these two aspects: sin-\ngle reward strategies fail to improve both abilities simulta-\nneously, while fixed-weight mixed-reward methods lack the\nability to adapt to different writing scenarios. To address this\nproblem, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Mixed\nRewards (RLMR), utilizing a dynamically mixed reward sys-\ntem from a writing reward model evaluating subjective writ-\ning quality and a constraint verification model assessing ob-\njective constraint following. The constraint following reward\nweight is adjusted dynamically according to the writing qual-\nity within sampled groups, ensuring that samples violating\nconstraints get negative advantage in GRPO and thus penal-\nized during training, which is the key innovation of this pro-\nposed method. We conduct automated and manual evalua-\ntions across diverse model families from 8B to 72B param-\neters. Additionally, we construct a real-world writing bench-\nmark named WriteEval for comprehensive evaluation. Re-\nsults illustrate that our method achieves consistent improve-\nments in both instruction following (IFEval from 83.36% to\n86.65%) and writing quality (72.75% win rate in manual ex-\npert pairwise evaluations on WriteEval). To the best of our\nknowledge, RLMR is the first work to combine subjective\npreferences with objective verification in online RL training,\nproviding an effective solution for multi-dimensional creative\nwriting optimization.\nIntroduction\nLarge language models (LLMs) are widely applied to cre-\native writing tasks, from traditional poetry composition to\nmodern fiction generation, and from literary scriptwriting to\ncommercial copywriting, fulfilling diverse writing demands\nacross domains and genres. To further enhance LLM perfor-\nmance in creative writing tasks, reinforcement learning tech-\nniques have been widely applied during the post-training\nphase. Through methods such as Group Relative Policy Op-\ntimization (GRPO), researchers aim to guide models toward\n*Work done when these authors interned at Tencent.\n\u2020Corresponding author.\ngenerating higher-quality creative content through reward\nsignals.\nHowever, existing reinforcement learning reward strate-\ngies suffer from fundamental limitations. The evaluation cri-\nteria for creative writing are inherently dual in nature: on\none hand, they require assessing subjective writing quali-\nties such as literariness, emotional expression, and original-\nity; on the other hand, they necessitate verifying objective\nconstraint following, including length constraints, format re-\nquirements, and specific writing styles. Different creative\nwriting scenarios exhibit significant variations in their em-\nphasis on subjective versus objective evaluation.\nCurrent reward strategies face two major challenges. First,\nsingle reward strategies struggle to simultaneously optimize\nboth subjective and objective dimensions. As illustrated in\nFigure 1, under single-signal strategies, reward models only\nscore writing quality without reflecting constraint following.\nSecond, existing multi-reward signal fusion strategies typ-\nically employ fixed-weight summation. Such fixed-weight\nmechanisms fail to dynamically adjust weights based on ac-\ntual sample performance within groups, making them un-\nsuitable for different writing scenarios.\nTo address these issues, we propose Reinforcement\nLearning with Mixed Rewards (RLMR), a dynamic mixed-\nreward framework for creative writing. By coupling a writ-\ning reward model for evaluating subjective writing qual-\nity with a constraint verification model for assessing objec-\ntive constraint following, we implement an adaptive mech-\nanism that dynamically allocates reward weights based on\nconstraint following within sampled group responses. Un-\nlike existing methods that use fixed-weight fusion, our core\ninnovation lies in dynamically adjusting the constraint fol-\nlowing reward weight according to writing quality within\nsampled groups. This ensures that samples violating con-\nstraints receive negative advantage values in GRPO calcula-\ntions, thereby being systematically penalized during policy\ngradient updates.\nTo validate our method\u2019s effectiveness, we conducted\ntraining on various scales of Qwen and DeepSeek model\nfamilies and performed both automated and manual evalua-\ntions on multiple creative writing and instruction-following\nbenchmarks. RLMR shows substantial gains in both writing\nquality and constraint following compared to single-reward\nand linear weighting baseline methods.

Al-\ngorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)\n(Ouyang et al. 2022) and Group Relative Policy Opti-\nmization (GRPO) (Shao et al. 2024) are widely used to\nalign LLM behavior with human preferences. PPO ensures\ntraining stability by limiting the extent of policy updates\nthrough clipped probability ratios, but requires separate\nvalue function training which increases computational over-\nhead. GRPO optimizes policy gradients by estimating base-\nlines from sampled groups, avoiding the need for separate\nvalue function training while maintaining competitive per-\nformance. Given GRPO\u2019s computational efficiency and ef-\nfectiveness in creative writing scenarios, we choose it as our\nreinforcement learning framework.\nMixed reward strategies have become increasingly\nimportant in reinforcement learning, integrating multi-\ndimensional reward signals to guide model training more\ncomprehensively. Peng et al. (Peng et al. 2025a) proposed\nthe Agentic Reward Modeling framework, which combines\nhuman preference rewards with verifiable correctness sig-\nnals (factuality and instruction following) to provide more\nreliable rewards for large language models. Jia et al. (Jia\net al. 2025) introduced Writing-Zero, proposing a writing-\nprinciple-based pairwise Generative Reward Model (GRM)\nthat leverages self-principled critique to transform subjec-\ntive assessments into reliable, verifiable rewards for cre-\native writing tasks. Wu et al. (Wu et al. 2025) developed\nLongWriter-Zero framework for ultra-long text generation,\nemploying specialized reward models targeting length con-\ntrol, writing quality, and structural formatting with a com-\nposite reward function that averages individual advantages\nto balance multiple reward dimensions.\nHowever, these existing mixed reward approaches all rely\non fixed-weight fusion mechanisms, which suffer from fun-\ndamental limitations. First, fixed weights cannot adapt to\nvarying constraint compliance patterns within different sam-\nple groups. When most responses in a group violate con-\nstraints, fixed-weight strategies still assign positive gradients\nto high-quality but constraint-violating samples, contradict-\ning creative writing requirements. Second, the relative im-\nportance between subjective quality assessment and objec-\ntive constraint following cannot be accurately determined,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nquery\nPolicy\nModel\n\ufeff\no\n\u200b1\n\ufeff\no\n\u200b2\n\ufeff\no\n\u200b3\nWriting\nRM\n\ufeff\nr\n\u200b =\n1\n8\n\ufeff\nr\n\u200b =\n2\n8\n\ufeff\nr\n\u200b =\n3\n3\nDynamic score adjustment\nReference\nModel\nKL\nGroup\ncomputation\n\ufeff\n\u03b4 =\n\u200b\nn\u2212k\nn\u22c5r\n\u200b+\u03b3\u22c5n\u2212\nr\n\u200b\nmax\nvio\n\u2211i=1\nn\ni\nValidator \u274c\n\ufeff\n\u03b4 = 4\nFinal Reward Score\nValidator\n\u2705\n\u274c\n\u2705\nValidator\n\u2705\nValidator\n\u2705\n8\n8-4=4\n3\nFigure 2: Overview of our Dynamic Mixed-Reward GRPO Framework. The policy model generates responses (o1, o2, o3)\nevaluated by both writing quality (Writing RM) and constraint compliance (Validator). In this example: n = 3 (total samples),\nrvio\nmax = 8 (highest reward among violating samples), \u03b3 = 1 (minimum gap below the mean), k = 1 (number of violating\nsamples), Pn\ni=1 ri = 19 (sum of original rewards). The framework calculates penalty \u03b4 = 4 and deducts it from violating\nsamples (o2 : 8 \u21924). After adjustment around mean=5, only high-quality compliant samples (o1) receive positive gradients\n(green), while both low-quality samples (o3) and constraint-violating samples (o2) receive negative gradients (red).\nmaking weight assignment difficult. To address these issues,\nwe propose a dynamic mixed-reward GRPO framework that\nadaptively adjusts penalty weights based on actual constraint\ncompliance performance within each sampled group, ensur-\ning constraint-violating samples consistently receive nega-\ntive advantages during training. This dynamic adjustment\napproach is better suited for creative writing tasks.\nRLMR Framework for Creative Writing\nTo effectively combine subjective and objective reward sig-\nnals, we propose a mixed-reward GRPO framework. This\nframework integrates a writing reward model for evaluat-\ning writing quality with a verification model for assessing\ninstruction compliance. By adjusting reward scores based\non verification results, we achieve improved instruction-\nfollowing capability while maintaining writing quality.\nReward Models\nOur RLMR framework employs two reward models: a writ-\ning reward model that evaluates subjective writing quality\nand a constraint verification model that assesses objective\ncompliance with task requirements.\nWriting Reward Model.\nThe writing reward model rwrite\nevaluates the overall quality of creative writing outputs. We\ntrain this model on a large language model using human-\nannotated preference pairs (yw, yl) for creative writing\nprompts x. Following the Bradley-Terry preference model,\nwe optimize:\nLwrite = \u2212E(x,yw,yl)\u223cD [log \u03c3(rwrite(x, yw) \u2212rwrite(x, yl))]\n(1)\nwhere yw and yl denote preferred and non-preferred re-\nsponses, and \u03c3 is the sigmoid function. Unlike general re-\nward models, our writing reward model captures creative\nwriting features including literary expression, emotional\ndepth, originality, narrative coherence, and stylistic maturity.\nConstraint Verification Model\nThe verification model\nidentifies constraint violations in creative writing tasks, in-\ncluding word limits, formatting requirements, and content\nrestrictions. For query q and response o, the model outputs:\nV (o, q) =\nn\n^\ni=1\nverify(o, ci)\n(2)\nwhere C = {c1, c2, ..., cn} represents n identified con-\nstraints, and V denotes logical conjunction. A response is\ncompliant only if all constraints are satisfied.\nDynamic Reward Adjustment Strategy\nFixed-weight reward fusion inadequately balances writing\nquality and constraint compliance. We introduce a dynamic\nadjustment mechanism that modifies original rewards be-\nfore computing GRPO advantages. This ensures constraint-\nviolating samples receive systematic penalties while pre-\nserving GRPO\u2019s comparative structure.\nIn standard GRPO, policy \u03c0\u03b8old generates G responses\n{o1, ..., oG} for query q with rewards {r1, ..., rG}. Advan-\ntages are computed as:\n\u02c6Ai = ri \u2212mean(r)\nstd(r)\n(3)\nOur strategy ensures constraint-violating samples obtain\nnegative advantages after normalization, acting as negative\nexamples during optimization. Compliant samples receive\npositive advantages and are prioritized for learning.\nFor each query, we sample n responses S = {s1, ..., sn}\nwith\noriginal\nrewards\n{r1, ..., rn}.\nWe\nfirst\nidentify\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconstraint-violating samples through the verification model\nand adjust their rewards accordingly:\nr\u2032\ni =\n\u001ari\nif V (si, q) = True\nri \u2212\u03b4\nif V (si, q) = False\n(4)\nwhere \u03b4 > 0 is the penalty term to be determined. Let\nk denote the number of constraint-violating samples in the\ngroup. The adjusted mean becomes:\n\u00afr\u2032 = 1\nn\nn\nX\ni=1\nr\u2032\ni = 1\nn\n n\nX\ni=1\nri \u2212k\u03b4\n!\n(5)\nTo guarantee that all constraint-violating samples receive\nnegative advantages after normalization, we require that for\nany violating sample j where V (sj, q) = False:\nr\u2032\nj < \u00afr\u2032 \u2212\u03b3\n(6)\nwhere \u03b3 > 0 controls the minimum gap below the ad-\njusted mean. This ensures violating samples will have suffi-\nciently negative advantages to be suppressed during training.\nTo determine the appropriate penalty \u03b4, let rvio\nmax be the\nhighest original reward among all constraint-violating sam-\nples. Substituting Equations (4) and (5) into inequality (6),\nwe derive the penalty bound:\n\u03b4 \u2265n \u00b7 rvio\nmax + n \u00b7 \u03b3 \u2212Pn\ni=1 ri\nn \u2212k\n(7)\nSetting \u03b4 above this bound ensures all violating sam-\nples produce negative advantages, systematically suppress-\ning them during gradient updates while preserving the rel-\native ordering among compliant samples. This dynamic ad-\njustment mechanism allows the model to learn from high-\nquality compliant responses while avoiding the reinforce-\nment of constraint violations.\nDynamic Sampling Strategy\nInspired by DAPO (Yu et al.\n2025), we address gradient vanishing in creative writing\nRL training. When all sampled responses receive identi-\ncal scores, zero advantages yield zero gradients. In cre-\native tasks, this occurs with over-optimized samples, under-\noptimized samples, and samples where all responses violate\nconstraints.\nWe implement a composite filtering strategy that removes\nthree types of ineffective samples: (1) groups where all re-\nwards exceed a high threshold, (2) groups where all rewards\nfall below a low threshold, and (3) groups where all re-\nsponses fail verification. When filtered samples are insuf-\nficient, we dynamically resample new prompts to maintain\nadequate contrastive signals for effective training.\nExperiments and Results\nIn this section, we show experiments to test our dynamic\nmixed-reward GRPO framework for creative writing. We de-\nscribe the setup, share results, and give analysis.\nExperimental Setup\nTraining Query Construction\nWe construct our GRPO\ntraining queries from real-world seed data, we apply the\nself-instruct (Wang et al. 2023) methodology to expand the\ndataset diversity while maintaining realistic writing scenar-\nios. To ensure balanced genre representation, we employ\nDeepSeek-V3 to classify generated queries by writing genre\nand adjust the sampling distribution to match real-world pro-\nportions observed in our seed data. This process yields a fi-\nnal training set of 8,739 queries.\nEvaluation Benchmarks\nWe test model performance on\nwriting quality and instruction following using four bench-\nmarks:\nWritingBench (Yao et al. 2025) covers 6 main categories\nand 100 subdomains like academic, finance, politics, lit-\nerature, education, and marketing. It has 1,239 real-world\nprompts, each with 5 custom criteria. We use Claude-4-\nSonnet to score outputs.\nWriteEval is our custom dataset containing 890 sam-\nples collected from real-world scenarios and augmented\nwith LLM-generated instructions to match authentic writ-\ning styles. The dataset uniformly covers 30 primary\nwriting genres and 377 secondary categories, including\nChinese-specific genres such as folk texts, classical Chi-\nnese, and composition writing. For each instruction, we\nsolicited responses from six competitive Chinese writ-\ning models: Claude-4-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-Pro, DeepSeek-\nR1, DeepSeek-V3, Doubao-1.5-Thinking, and Hunyuan-\nTurboS. Human experts conducted blind evaluation to se-\nlect the best response from each set as reference answers.\nFor automated evaluation, Claude-4-Opus compares model\noutputs against reference answers to determine win rates:\nWin Rate =\nNumber of wins\nTotal comparisons \u00d7 100% where a \u201dwin\u201d indicates\nthe model output is judged superior to the reference answer.\nDetailed prompt templates are provided in the appendix.\nComplexBench (Wen et al. 2024) checks complex in-\nstruction following with combined constraints. It builds hard\nprompts that need to meet multiple rules. Scoring uses ques-\ntions to check each part.\nIFEval (Zhou et al. 2023) is Google\u2019s benchmark for\nverifiable instructions like word count or keywords. It has\n25 types across 500 prompts. We use prompt-level strict-\naccuracy for evaluation.\nBaseline Methods\nTo evaluate our dynamic mixed-reward\nstrategy, we compare against three baseline methods that\nrepresent the spectrum of existing reward strategies in cre-\native writing optimization:\n(1) Writing Reward Only GRPO: This baseline trains\nusing only writing quality rewards without any constraint\nverification signals. This method represents the traditional\napproach in RLHF where models are optimized solely based\non human preference signals for output quality (Ouyang\net al. 2022; Stiennon et al. 2020).

This approach aligns with\nrecent work on Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Re-\nwards (RLVR), where models are trained using determin-\nistic verification functions for tasks with clear correctness\ncriteria (Cobbe et al. 2021; Mroueh 2025). TheBy com-\nparing against these methods, we demonstrate that our dy-\nnamic mixed-reward strategy addresses the limitations of\nboth single-reward and fixed-weight approaches, providing\na more effective solution for creative writing optimization.\n(3) Linear Weighting Strategy: Following the approach\nproposed by Peng et al. (2025b), this baseline combines\nwriting rewards with verification signals through fixed-\nweight linear combination. Specifically, we normalize both\nwriting rewards and verification scores to the [0,1] range\nand compute their arithmetic mean: (snormalized writing +\nsnormalized verification)/2. This method represents the current\nstate-of-the-art in mixed-reward strategies, as demonstrated\nin the Agentic Reward Modeling framework (Peng et al.\n2025b), which successfully integrates human preference re-\nwards with verifiable correctness signals including factuality\nand instruction following.\nReward Model and Training Setup\nWriting Reward Model.\nWe use a Pointwise Bradley-\nTerry Reward Model (Bradley and Terry 1952; Ouyang\net al. 2022) for continuous feedback. It trains on Tencent-\nHunyuan-Large (Sun et al. 2024) with 200,000 labeled sam-\nples.

It makes check-\nlists and verifies each one. We employ binary verification\n(all constraints satisfied or not) rather than proportion-based\nscoring because partial constraint satisfaction is function-\nally equivalent to complete failure in creative writing tasks.\nThis binary approach ensures the model learns to generate\nresponses that satisfy all constraints simultaneously, rather\nthan trading off between different constraint types. See ap-\npendix for prompt details.\nFigure 4: Pairwise comparison results for Overall Per-\nformance. \u201dWin\u201d indicates the left method outperforms\nthe right method; \u201dtie\u201d indicates comparable performance;\n\u201dlose\u201d indicates the left method underperforms. The red\ndashed line represents equal performance (50%). RLMR\ndemonstrates significant advantages over both baseline\nmethods.\nExperimental Results\nAutomated Evaluation Results\nWe test our framework\non four models: Qwen2.5-32B and Qwen2.5-72B (Team\n2024; Yang et al. 2024), Qwen3-8B (Yang et al. 2025),\nand DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B (DeepSeek-AI 2025).\nTable ?? shows results across methods and benchmarks.\nThe automated evaluation results reveal compelling ev-\nidence for the effectiveness of our dynamic mixed-reward\napproach. Results from Qwen2.5-32B clearly expose the\ninherent problems with single reward signals. When train-\ning with writing RM alone, writing quality improves mod-\nestly from 6.14 to 6.35, yet instruction following suffers\nsubstantial degradation: ComplexBench performance drops\nfrom 74.78% to 68.42%, while IFEval accuracy falls from\n83.36% to 80.41%. The reverse pattern emerges when using\nonly the constraint verification model\u2014instruction follow-\ning on ComplexBench rises from 74.78% to 83.94%, but\nwriting quality plummets from 6.14 to 5.73, with WriteE-\nval performance collapsing from 3.93% to a mere 1.24%.\nThis stark trade-off demonstrates that single signals cannot\nbalance subjective creative quality with objective constraint\nadherence.\nGiven these limitations, mixed-reward strategies emerge\nas a natural solution by combining writing RM with con-\nstraint verification signals. The most classical approach is\nlinear weighting, which averages the two reward types with\nfixed coefficients. On Qwen2.5-32B, this approach elevates\nwriting quality to 7.13 while preserving reasonable instruc-\ntion following capabilities, successfully avoiding the severe\nbias problems observed with single-signal methods. These\nresults underscore the critical importance of integrating both\nsubjective and objective evaluation dimensions in creative\nwriting optimization.\nHowever, our RLMR method delivers even greater im-\nprovements, consistently outperforming linear weighting\nacross all tested models. On Qwen2.5-32B, RLMR pushes\nwriting quality further to 7.93 and achieves an 11.56%\nWriteEval win rate, substantially surpassing linear weight-\ning\u2019s 7.13 and 6.40% respectively. This pattern of superior\nperformance extends to other architectures: Qwen3-8B sees\nwriting quality rise from 7.61 to 8.13, with WriteEval win\nrates jumping from 26.64% to 31.69%. Similarly, Qwen2.5-\n72B confirms this trend, with WriteEval performance climb-\ning from 10.22% to 17.18%.\nThe robustness of these improvements becomes evident\nwhen examining results across diverse model scales. Our ex-\nperiments span architectures ranging from 8B to 72B param-\neters, including both Qwen and DeepSeek families, with all\nmodels demonstrating consistent advantages under RLMR.\nManual Evaluation Results\nWe conducted human evalu-\nation on 200 randomly sampled instances from the WriteE-\nval dataset to assess model performance across three dimen-\nsions: Instruction Following, Content Quality, and Overall\nPerformance. Detailed scoring criteria and guidelines are\nprovided in the appendix. For Instruction Following, we\nconsider a score of 4 as complete instruction adherence. For\nContent Quality and Overall Performance, scores of 3 or\nabove are considered satisfactory.\nFigure 3 presents the score distribution across all three\nevaluation dimensions. The results clearly demonstrate the\nlimitations of single-reward strategies. The writing-only\nbaseline shows inferior performance across multiple dimen-\nsions compared to mixed-reward approaches, with notably\nlower satisfactory rates in instruction following and content\nquality. Among mixed-reward strategies, our RLMR method\nachieves higher satisfactory rates across all dimensions.\nSpecifically, for Instruction Following, RLMR shows the\nhighest proportion of perfect scores (score 4), indicating\nsuperior constraint adherence. In Content Quality, RLMR\ndemonstrates a more favorable distribution with increased\nproportions in higher score ranges (scores 4-5), suggesting\nbetter content generation capabilities. The Overall Perfor-\nmance dimension reveals similar trends, with RLMR achiev-\ning the most balanced distribution toward higher satisfaction\nlevels.\nFigure 4 shows the results of direct pairwise comparisons\nfor Overall Performance. RLMR achieves substantial win\nrates against both baseline methods: 45.5% win rate ver-\nsus writing-only baseline and 33.5% win rate versus lin-\near weighting strategy. These results demonstrate that our\nRLMR strategy achieves higher usability and satisfaction\nrates in creative writing tasks, confirming the practical ef-\nfectiveness of our approach.\n\n| win tie Mm lose\n\nLinear Weighting\nStrategy\n\nonly Writing RM\n\nonly Writing RM\n\nLinear Weighting\nStrategy\n\n40 60 80 100\nOverall Performance\n\n(a) Writing Reward Scores\n(b) IFEval Performance\n(c) Response Length\nFigure 5: Training dynamics across different metrics.

Using only writing rewards improves cre-\native quality but reduces constraint adherence. Using only\nverification signals severely harms writing quality while pro-\nviding limited gains in instruction following. These findings\nconfirm that creative writing optimization requires careful\nintegration of both subjective and objective evaluation crite-\nria.\nOur dynamic mixed-reward strategy significantly outper-\nforms linear weighting approaches across all tested models\nand benchmarks. This superiority stems from fundamental\nlimitations of fixed-weight methods. Writing quality scores\nand constraint verification signals operate on different scales\nand distributions. Writing rewards typically follow continu-\nous distributions, while constraint verification produces bi-\nnary outcomes. The scalar inconsistency between these two\nsignals makes it difficult to determine appropriate weight-\ning coefficients. Moreover, optimal weighting coefficients\nneed adjustment for different reward models, making fixed-\nweight approaches impractical across diverse model config-\nurations.\nOur dynamic adjustment mechanism addresses these\nlimitations by calculating penalty terms based on actual\nconstraint compliance patterns within each sample group.\nRather than applying uniform weights, the approach mod-\nulates penalties according to the theoretical bounds derived\nin Equation (7). This ensures constraint-violating samples\nconsistently receive negative advantages and are suppressed\nduring training.\nFigure 5 shows training dynamics across key metrics.\nThe writing RM only baseline achieves the highest writ-\ning reward scores during training (Figure 5a), but this im-\nprovement reveals classic reward hacking behavior. Despite\nhigh reward scores, its IFEval performance deteriorates sig-\nnificantly (Figure 5b), dropping below both the original\nmodel and other baselines. This divergence between reward\nscores and actual instruction-following capability demon-\nstrates that the model learns to exploit the reward model\nrather than genuinely improving writing quality.\nThe reward hacking behavior is further evidenced by the\ndramatic increase in response length (Figure 5c). The writ-\ning RM only baseline shows uncontrolled length growth,\nreaching over 1400 tokens on average, which explains its\npoor instruction-following performance. When models gen-\nerate excessively long outputs, they cannot properly adhere\nto specific constraints like word count limits, format require-\nments, or conciseness instructions.\nIn contrast, our RLMR method maintains balanced opti-\nmization across all metrics. It achieves steady improvement\nin writing reward scores while preserving strong IFEval per-\nformance, demonstrating that our dynamic reward adjust-\nment successfully prevents the model from exploiting ei-\nther reward signal. The controlled response length further\nconfirms that RLMR learns to generate high-quality content\nwithout resorting to length inflation. This balanced training\ndynamic validates the effectiveness of our dynamic penalty\nmechanism in creating models that excel at both creative\nquality and constraint adherence.\nConclusion\nwe proposed RLMR (Reinforcement Learning with Mixed\nRewards), a dynamic mixed-reward GRPO framework that\naddresses the fundamental challenge of balancing subjective\ncreative quality with objective constraint adherence in cre-\native writing optimization. By developing a dynamic reward\nadjustment mechanism that ensures constraint-violating\nsamples receive negative advantages during training, our\nmethod overcomes the limitations of both single-reward\nand fixed-weight strategies. Experimental results across di-\nverse model architectures demonstrate that RLMR achieves\nsubstantial improvements in both writing quality (11.56%\nWriteEval win rate on Qwen2.5-32B) and constraint com-\npliance (86.65% IFEval accuracy), with human evaluation\nconfirming significant user preference. The training dynam-\nics analysis reveals that our method successfully prevents\nreward hacking while maintaining stable optimization, pro-\nviding a principled and computationally efficient solution to\nmulti-objective creative writing optimization. Future work\nincludes extending this framework to other multi-signal sce-\nnarios such as dialogue systems and code generation.\n\nPerformance\n\n6.5\n\n6.0\n\nW\"\nul\n\ndl\nfo)\n\n4.5\n\nWriting Reward Model Scores During Training\n\n=== RLMR\nLinear Weighting Strategy\n=== only Writing RM\n\nStep\n\nPerformance\n\n0.86\n\n0.84\n\no\n\u00a90\nN\n\n0.80\n\n0.74\n\nIFEval Performance During Training\n\nRLMR\n\nLinear Weighting Strategy\n\nonly Writing RM\n\nonly Constraint Verification Model\n\nStep\n\nLength\n\n1600\n\n1400\n\n1200\n\n1000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\nGenerated Response Length During Training\n\nRLMR\n\nLinear Weighting Strategy\n\nonly Writing RM\n\nonly Constraint Verification Model\n\nStep\n\nReferences\nBradley, R.

Each di-\nmension focuses on specific characteristics that together pro-\nvide comprehensive coverage of response effectiveness.The\nscoring criteria are shown in Table 2. Instruction Follow-\ning (1-4 scale) measures how accurately the response fol-\nlows the given instructions and meets specified require-\nments. This dimension focuses on:\n\u2022 Understanding of user intent and task requirements\n\u2022 Compliance with format specifications (word count,\nstructure, style)\n\u2022 Adherence to content constraints and guidelines\n\u2022 Completion of all requested elements\nContent Quality (1-5 scale) evaluates the intrinsic qual-\nity of the generated content itself. This dimension assesses:\n\u2022 Factual accuracy and information reliability\n\u2022 Logical flow and coherence of ideas\n\u2022 Depth and thoroughness of content coverage\n\u2022 Appropriateness and relevance to the topic\nOverall Performance (1-5 scale) provides a holistic as-\nsessment of the response\u2019s practical value and user satisfac-\ntion. This dimension considers:\n\u2022 Practical utility for the intended purpose\n\u2022 Amount of editing or revision needed\n\u2022 Overall effectiveness in meeting user expectations\n\u2022 Integration of instruction following and content quality\nThe key distinction between these dimensions is their fo-\ncus: Instruction Following emphasizes compliance and ad-\nherence, Content Quality focuses on the substance and reli-\nability of information, while Overall Performance captures\nthe integrated user experience. A response may score differ-\nently across dimensions\u2014for example, perfectly following\ninstructions (high Instruction Following) while containing\nshallow content (lower Content Quality).\nAnnotators were trained to evaluate each dimension in-\ndependently while considering the specific requirements of\ncreative writing tasks.\nWriteEval Dataset Information\nWriteEval is a comprehensive Chinese creative writing eval-\nuation dataset containing 890 samples collected from real-\nworld scenarios. The dataset covers diverse writing genres\nand tasks, Each sample includes a writing prompt with spe-\ncific requirements and reference answers selected by human\nexperts from multiple competitive models.\nThe dataset construction process involved collecting seed\ndata from authentic writing platforms and augmenting it us-\ning self-instruct methodology to maintain realistic writing\nscenarios. To ensure balanced representation, we employed\nFigure 6: distribution of samples across major genre cate-\ngories\nDeepSeek-V3 to classify samples by genre and adjusted the\ndistribution to match real-world writing task frequencies.\nThe final dataset reflects the actual distribution of creative\nwriting demands encountered in practice.\nWriteEval uniformly covers 30 primary writing genres\nwith a total of 377 secondary categories. The dataset in-\ncludes Chinese-specific genres such as folk texts, classical\nChinese, and composition writing alongside universal cate-\ngories. Table 3 shows the distribution of samples across ma-\njor genre categories.Table 4 show some prompts of WriteE-\nval dataset.\nCase Study\nWe present case studies to show how different reward strate-\ngies work in practice. These examples help us understand\nwhy RLMR performs better than existing methods in real\nwriting tasks.\nMedical Thank-You Letter Reply\nWe examine a task\nwhere a doctor needs to reply to a patient\u2019s thank-you letter.\nThe task has specific requirements: (1) include salutation,\ngreeting, body, closing wishes, signature, and date; (2) start\nthe body with \u201dThank you very much for your letter, I feel\nvery honored\u201d; (3) end the body with \u201dThank you again for\nyour recognition and encouragement of my work. Wish you\ngood health and a happy life!\u201d.\nAs shown in Figure 7, the three methods produce different\nresults:\nWriting Reward Only Strategy (3 points): This ap-\nproach creates rich and emotionally engaging content with\nprofessional warmth. However, it fails to include the re-\nquired opening phrase \u201dThank you very much for your letter,\nI feel very honored\u201d, using a generic greeting instead. While\nthe content quality is high, the constraint violation signifi-\ncantly reduces its practical usability.\nLinear Weighting Strategy (2 points): This method cor-\nrectly includes both required opening and closing phrases,\nshowing better instruction following. However, the con-\ntent between these constraints is overly formulaic and lacks\n\n\nTable 2: Response Quality Scoring Rubric\nScore\nInstruction Following\nContent Quality\nOverall Performance\n1\nComplete misunderstanding of user\nintent.

Let us open the \"Operations Handbook\" together,\nwith knowledge as wings and action as our vessel, heading\ntoward a bright future!\n[Your Name]\nCEO\n[Company Name]\n[Date]\nFigure 8: Comparison of three reward strategies for CEO message writing. RLMR delivers concise yet comprehensive content\nthat accurately captures core intentions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe message is both inspiring and practical, demonstrating\neffective content organization and priority management.\nThese case studies reveal how RLMR achieves better bal-\nance between writing quality and constraint compliance.\nOur method helps models follow instructions while main-\ntaining good content, which demonstrates the effectiveness\nof our dynamic mixed-reward approach in real-world cre-\native writing scenarios.t we aimed for.\nPrompts Used in Our Work\nThe prompts used for WriteEval automated evaluation and\nConstraint Verification Model are shown in Figures 9 and 10,\nrespectively.\nTraining Infrastructure and Hyperparameters\nWe run on 128 H20 GPUs (64 for GRPO, 64 for ser-\nvices) with 9,743 creative writing queries. We use the VERL\nframework (Sheng et al. 2024). Training is 1 epoch (68 steps,\n23 hours), learning rate 1 \u00d7 10\u22126, batch size 128, 8 samples\nper query, temperature 1.0, repetition penalty 1.0, max out-\nput 14,000 tokens.\n\nAs a large language model evaluation expert, please act as an impartial judge to evaluate\nthe quality of an AI assistant's response to a user's question. Please assess [Answer A] and\n[Answer B] based on the [Assistant Settings], [Conversation History], and [User Question],\nand compare them to select the relatively better answer.\nGiven Question and Answers to Evaluate\n[Assistant Settings Begin]\n{system}\n[Assistant Settings End]\n[Conversation History Begin]\n{history}\n[Conversation History End]\n[User Question Begin]\n{prompt}\n[User Question End]\n[Answer A Begin]\n{answer}\n[Answer A End]\n[Answer B Begin]\n{ref_answer}\n[Answer B End]\nOutput Format\nPlease comprehensively evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the answers, and\ndetermine the result as follows:\nYes: Answer 1 is better than Answer 2\nNo: Answer 2 is better than Answer 1\nFigure 9: Prompt used for WriteEval automated evaluation\n\n[Question/Context]\n%s\n[Question/Context End]\n[Assistant]\n%s\n[Assistant End]\nYou are an AI assistant specializing in evaluating responses. Above is a reply from another AI assistant. Do not\nmemorize the AI assistant's possible self-evaluation of its response. Next, please complete the following\nassessment task:\n[Assistant's Answer Word Count/Length/Frequency Check]\nNULL\n[Assistant's Answer Word Count/Length/Frequency Check End]\n[Evaluation Criteria]\n1. If the [Assistant]'s answer does not meet the user's requirements, it must be judged as incorrect.\n2. Incompleteness or truncation is the most serious error, therefore if the [Assistant]'s answer is incomplete, it\nmust be judged as incorrect.\n[System]\nYou are an answer quality assessment expert. Please check whether the [Assistant]'s answer satisfies all\nrequirements in the [Question/Context] by following these steps:\n1. First analyze what specific requirements are in the [Question/Context]\n2. Determine whether the [Assistant]'s answer meets all requirements in the [Question/Context]. Note: If the\n[Question/Context] includes requirements regarding word count, length, frequency, etc., judge as follows:\n2.1 If the result in [Assistant's Answer Word Count/Length/Frequency Check] is NULL, please ignore this result\nand make your own judgment\n2.2 If the result in [Assistant's Answer Word Count/Length/Frequency Check] is not NULL, please base your\njudgment entirely on this result\n3. According to the [Evaluation Criteria], judge whether the [Assistant]'s answer is correct.\n4. Please first provide your analysis process, then give your conclusion in the format: \"- Conclusion:\nCorrect/Incorrect\".\n[Additional Requirements]\nAfter outputting your assessment above, please organize your check into jsonlist format, with each constraint\ncorresponding to an item. Each JSON object should include:\n1. 'idx': Sequence number\n2. 'constraint_str': Constraint content, such as \"Write a script for a modern history video group assignment.\"\nor \"The composition must have more than 600 words\"\n3. 'constraint_judge_str': Reasons why the assistant's answer does/doesn't comply with this constraint.\n4. 'constraint_judge': Judgment on whether the assistant's answer complies with this constraint, value being\nTrue/False\n5. 'is_digital': Constraint type. You only need to determine whether the constraint includes numbers, such as\nrequiring xx words, appearing xx times, writing several sentences/items/articles, requiring x-character words,\netc. Any constraint involving numerical judgment must be classified as a numerical constraint. If judged as a\nnumerical constraint, the value is True, otherwise False.\n6. 'core_constraint': Whether this constraint is a core constraint, value being True/False.\nNotes:\n1. Definition of core constraint (core_constraint): The most central task in the user's instruction (generally one\nand only one). For example: a request to write an 800-word essay beginning with \"My mother.\" Here there are\nthree constraints: writing an essay, 800-word requirement, beginning with \"My mother\". Among these, \"writing\nan essay\" is the core constraint.\n2. When judging is_digital, be sure not to miss constraints requiring x-character words, such as: \"come up\nwith some three-character sword names\" is a numerical constraint. Additionally, when dealing with quantity\nissues related to common knowledge (e.g., idioms must be four characters), these should also be judged as\nnumerical constraints.\nNow begin your output:\nFigure 10: Prompt used by the Constraint Verification Model\n"
